BSP Financial Group Limited's (ASX:BFL) institutional investors lost 3.5% over the past week but have profited from longer-term gains 2024-05-29T05:04:36.000Z

A look at the shareholders of BSP Financial Group Limited (
) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 50% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
Institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to AU$3.0b last week. However, the 46% one-year return to shareholders may have helped lessen their pain. They should, however, be mindful of further losses in the future.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of BSP Financial Group.
Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.
As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in BSP Financial Group. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see BSP Financial Group's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
Hedge funds don't have many shares in BSP Financial Group. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Independent Public Business Corporation of PNG with 18% of shares outstanding. Nambawan Super Limited is the second largest shareholder owning 10% of common stock, and Petroleum Resources (Kutubu) Limited holds about 9.9% of the company stock.
To make our study more interesting, we found that the top 5 shareholders control more than half of the company which implies that this group has considerable sway over the company's decision-making.
Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. As far as we can tell there isn't analyst coverage of the company, so it is probably flying under the radar.
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of BSP Financial Group Limited in their own names. But they may have an indirect interest through a corporate structure that we haven't picked up on. Keep in mind that it's a big company, and the insiders own AU$787k worth of shares. The absolute value might be more important than the proportional share. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking 
The general public-- including retail investors -- own 14% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.
It seems that Private Companies own 18%, of the BSP Financial Group stock. Private companies may be related parties. Sometimes insiders have an interest in a public company through a holding in a private company, rather than in their own capacity as an individual. While it's hard to draw any broad stroke conclusions, it is worth noting as an area for further research.
I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted 
 you should be aware of.
