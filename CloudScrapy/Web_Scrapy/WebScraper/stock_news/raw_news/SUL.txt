Is It Smart To Buy Super Retail Group Limited (ASX:SUL) Before It Goes Ex-Dividend? 2023-09-02T22:09:57.000Z

Readers hoping to buy 
 (
) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. In other words, investors can purchase Super Retail Group's shares before the 7th of September in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 18th of October.
The company's next dividend payment will be AU$0.69 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of AU$0.78 to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Super Retail Group has a trailing yield of 6.0% on the current share price of A$12.92. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Super Retail Group's dividend is reliable and sustainable. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing.
Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Super Retail Group paid out more than half (67%) of its earnings last year, which is a regular payout ratio for most companies. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Super Retail Group generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. It distributed 29% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.
It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.

Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. For this reason, we're glad to see Super Retail Group's earnings per share have risen 12% per annum over the last five years. Super Retail Group is paying out a bit over half its earnings, which suggests the company is striking a balance between reinvesting in growth, and paying dividends. This is a reasonable combination that could hint at some further dividend increases in the future.
Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, Super Retail Group has increased its dividend at approximately 9.3% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.
From a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Super Retail Group? Super Retail Group's growing earnings per share and conservative payout ratios make for a decent combination. We also like that it paid out a lower percentage of its cash flow. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research.
With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. To that end, you should learn about the

Super Retail Group (ASX:SUL) Is Increasing Its Dividend To A$0.69 2023-09-03T22:19:45.000Z

 (
) dividend will be increasing from last year's payment of the same period to A$0.69 on 18th of October. This makes the dividend yield about the same as the industry average at 6.0%.
Solid dividend yields are great, but they only really help us if the payment is sustainable. Prior to this announcement, Super Retail Group's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.
Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to fall by 10.7% over the next year. If the dividend continues along the path it has been on recently, the payout ratio in 12 months could be 106%, which is definitely a bit high to be sustainable going forward.
The company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from A$0.32 total annually to A$0.78. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 9.3% over that duration. A reasonable rate of dividend growth is good to see, but we're wary that the dividend history is not as solid as we'd like, having been cut at least once.
Growing earnings per share could be a mitigating factor when considering the past fluctuations in the dividend. Super Retail Group has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 12% per annum. The company is paying a reasonable amount of earnings to shareholders, and is growing earnings at a decent rate so we think it could be a decent dividend stock.
Overall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Super Retail Group is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. The distributions are easily covered by earnings, and there is plenty of cash being generated as well. However, it is worth noting that the earnings are expected to fall over the next year, which may not change the long term outlook, but could affect the dividend payment in the next 12 months. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.
It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Just as an example, we've come across 
 you should be aware of, and 1 of them is concerning. If you are a dividend investor, you might also want to look at our

Declining Stock and Solid Fundamentals: Is The Market Wrong About Super Retail Group Limited (ASX:SUL)? 2023-10-02T00:54:04.000Z

With its stock down 7.2% over the past month, it is easy to disregard Super Retail Group (ASX:SUL). However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Particularly, we will be paying attention to 
 ROE today.
Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Super Retail Group is:
19% = AU$263m ÷ AU$1.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).
The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every A$1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of A$0.19.
So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or "retain", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
To start with, Super Retail Group's ROE looks acceptable. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 20%. Consequently, this likely laid the ground for the decent growth of 19% seen over the past five years by Super Retail Group.
We then performed a comparison between Super Retail Group's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 20% in the same 5-year period.
Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is Super Retail Group fairly valued compared to other companies? These 
 might help you decide.
Super Retail Group has a significant three-year median payout ratio of 66%, meaning that it is left with only 34% to reinvest into its business. This implies that the company has been able to achieve decent earnings growth despite returning most of its profits to shareholders.
Moreover, Super Retail Group is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 68%. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 17%.
In total, we are pretty happy with Super Retail Group's performance. In particular, its high ROE is quite noteworthy and also the probable explanation behind its considerable earnings growth. Yet, the company is retaining a small portion of its profits. Which means that the company has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's not too bad. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

Super Retail Group's (ASX:SUL) 48% return outpaced the company's earnings growth over the same one-year period 2023-10-16T02:05:18.000Z

The simplest way to invest in stocks is to buy exchange traded funds. But one can do better than that by picking better than average stocks (as part of a diversified portfolio). For example, the 
 (
) share price is up 37% in the last 1 year, clearly besting the market return of around 3.5% (not including dividends). That's a solid performance by our standards! Zooming out, the stock is actually 
 1.7% in the last three years.
On the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns.
In his essay 
 Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.
Super Retail Group was able to grow EPS by 9.0% in the last twelve months. This EPS growth is significantly lower than the 37% increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it a year ago.
You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).
This 
 interactive report on Super Retail Group's 
 is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.
As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Super Retail Group, it has a TSR of 48% for the last 1 year. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!
We're pleased to report that Super Retail Group shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 48% over one year. That's including the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 13% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Even so, be aware that

Super Retail Group Limited's (ASX:SUL) 7.1% gain last week benefited both individual investors who own 41% as well as insiders 2023-10-30T02:34:39.000Z

A look at the shareholders of Super Retail Group Limited (
) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are individual investors with 41% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.
Individual investors gained the most after market cap touched AU$2.9b last week, while insiders who own 30% also benefitted.
Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Super Retail Group, beginning with the chart below.
Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.
We can see that Super Retail Group does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Super Retail Group's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.
Super Retail Group is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is Reginald Rowe, with ownership of 28%. Challenger Limited is the second largest shareholder owning 5.0% of common stock, and Alphinity Investment Management Pty Ltd. holds about 4.9% of the company stock.
We did some more digging and found that 10 of the top shareholders account for roughly 51% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat.
Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
It seems insiders own a significant proportion of Super Retail Group Limited. Insiders own AU$862m worth of shares in the AU$2.9b company. That's quite meaningful. Most would say this shows a good degree of alignment with shareholders, especially in a company of this size. You can 
With a 41% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Super Retail Group. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should learn about the

What Is Super Retail Group Limited's (ASX:SUL) Share Price Doing? 2023-11-13T03:18:47.000Z

While Super Retail Group Limited (
) might not be the most widely known stock at the moment, it saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the ASX. As a stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine Super Retail Group’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity.
The share price seems sensible at the moment according to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 11.68x is currently trading in-line with its industry peers’ ratio, which means if you buy Super Retail Group today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Super Retail Group’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.
Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Though in the case of Super Retail Group, it is expected to deliver a negative earnings growth of -6.3%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. It appears that risk of future uncertainty is high, at least in the near term.
 SUL seems priced close to industry peers right now, but given the uncertainty from negative returns in the future, this could be the right time to de-risk your portfolio. Is your current exposure to the stock beneficial for your total portfolio? And is the opportunity cost of holding a negative-outlook stock too high? Before you make a decision on SUL, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.
 If you’ve been keeping an eye on SUL for a while, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. This means there’s less benefit from mispricing. In addition to this, the negative growth outlook increases the risk of holding the stock. However, there are also other important factors we haven’t considered today, which can help crystallize your views on SUL should the price fluctuate below the industry PE ratio.
Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved. For instance, we've identified

Does Super Retail Group (ASX:SUL) Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist? 2024-01-03T23:23:02.000Z

Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.
So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like

Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS.

If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.

Super Retail Group Limited's (ASX:SUL) Intrinsic Value Is Potentially 94% Above Its Share Price 2024-01-18T00:00:16.000Z

Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Super Retail Group Limited (ASX:SUL) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.
We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the 
.
We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:
 = AU$3.2b
After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.7%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$436m× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.7%– 2.1%) = AU$7.9b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$7.9b÷ ( 1 + 7.7%)
= AU$3.7b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is AU$7.0b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of AU$15.9, the company appears quite good value at a 49% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.
The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Super Retail Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.130. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to "what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For Super Retail Group, we've put together three pertinent elements you should consider:

Super Retail Group's (ASX:SUL) Returns Have Hit A Wall 2024-02-25T00:32:16.000Z

If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? Firstly, we'll want to see a proven 
 on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding 
 of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. With that in mind, the ROCE of 
 (
) looks decent, right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.
If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Super Retail Group is:
0.18 = AU$422m ÷ (AU$3.4b - AU$1.1b) 
.
Thus, 
 That's a pretty standard return and it's in line with the industry average of 18%.
In the above chart we have measured Super Retail Group's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our 
 
.
The trend of ROCE doesn't stand out much, but returns on a whole are decent. The company has consistently earned 18% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 85% in that time. 18% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that Super Retail Group has consistently earned this amount. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.
In the end, Super Retail Group has proven its ability to adequately reinvest capital at good rates of return. And the stock has done incredibly well with a 190% return over the last five years, so long term investors are no doubt ecstatic with that result. So even though the stock might be more "expensive" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research.

Super Retail Group Limited (ASX:SUL) Looks Like A Good Stock, And It's Going Ex-Dividend Soon 2024-03-01T04:20:06.000Z

 (
) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in 4 days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Meaning, you will need to purchase Super Retail Group's shares before the 6th of March to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 12th of April.
The company's next dividend payment will be AU$0.32 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed AU$0.76 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Super Retail Group stock has a trailing yield of around 4.7% on the current share price of AU$16.31. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing.
Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Super Retail Group paid out more than half (65%) of its earnings last year, which is a regular payout ratio for most companies. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 39% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.
It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.
Click 
Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. For this reason, we're glad to see Super Retail Group's earnings per share have risen 12% per annum over the last five years. Super Retail Group has an average payout ratio which suggests a balance between growing earnings and rewarding shareholders. Given the quick rate of earnings per share growth and current level of payout, there may be a chance of further dividend increases in the future.
The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Super Retail Group has lifted its dividend by approximately 7.2% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.
Should investors buy Super Retail Group for the upcoming dividend? Super Retail Group's growing earnings per share and conservative payout ratios make for a decent combination. We also like that it paid out a lower percentage of its cash flow. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research.
While it's tempting to invest in Super Retail Group for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. To help with this, we've discovered 
 that you should be aware of before investing in their shares.

Super Retail Group Limited's (ASX:SUL) Fundamentals Look Pretty Strong: Could The Market Be Wrong About The Stock? 2024-03-17T22:00:56.000Z

It is hard to get excited after looking at Super Retail Group's (ASX:SUL) recent performance, when its stock has declined 8.7% over the past month. But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Super Retail Group's ROE today.
Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Super Retail Group is:
19% = AU$262m ÷ AU$1.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).
The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every A$1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated A$0.19 in profit.
We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or "retain", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
To begin with, Super Retail Group seems to have a respectable ROE. Even when compared to the industry average of 17% the company's ROE looks quite decent. Consequently, this likely laid the ground for the decent growth of 17% seen over the past five years by Super Retail Group.
As a next step, we compared Super Retail Group's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 18% in the same period.
The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about Super Retail Group's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.
The high three-year median payout ratio of 66% (or a retention ratio of 34%) for Super Retail Group suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of its income to its shareholders.
Additionally, Super Retail Group has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 68% of its profits over the next three years. As a result, Super Retail Group's ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 17% for future ROE.
Overall, we are quite pleased with Super Retail Group's performance. Especially the high ROE, Which has contributed to the impressive growth seen in earnings. Despite the company reinvesting only a small portion of its profits, it still has managed to grow its earnings so that is appreciable. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals? Click here to be taken to our analyst's forecasts page for the company.

Investing in Super Retail Group (ASX:SUL) five years ago would have delivered you a 165% gain 2024-04-03T04:41:33.000Z

When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average. And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. For example, the 
 (
) share price is up 96% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 26% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 32% in the last year , including dividends .
So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.
There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.
During five years of share price growth, Super Retail Group achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 12% per year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 14% per year. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.
You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).
This 
 interactive report on Super Retail Group's 
 is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.
As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Super Retail Group, it has a TSR of 165% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!
It's nice to see that Super Retail Group shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 32% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 22% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered

Individual investors are Super Retail Group Limited's (ASX:SUL) biggest owners and were hit after market cap dropped AU$176m 2024-04-19T21:06:03.000Z

Every investor in Super Retail Group Limited (
) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 47% stake, individual investors possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
While insiders who own 29% came under pressure after market cap dropped to AU$3.3b last week,individual investors took the most losses.
Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Super Retail Group, beginning with the chart below.
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Super Retail Group. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Super Retail Group's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.
Super Retail Group is not owned by hedge funds. Reginald Rowe is currently the company's largest shareholder with 28% of shares outstanding. Challenger Limited is the second largest shareholder owning 4.7% of common stock, and The Vanguard Group, Inc. holds about 3.5% of the company stock.
A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.
While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.
Our information suggests that insiders maintain a significant holding in Super Retail Group Limited. It has a market capitalization of just AU$3.3b, and insiders have AU$978m worth of shares in their own names. That's quite significant. Most would be pleased to see the board is investing alongside them. You may wish to 
With a 47% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Super Retail Group. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.
I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 
 you should know about.

Is There Now An Opportunity In Super Retail Group Limited (ASX:SUL)? 2024-05-06T02:47:34.000Z

While Super Retail Group Limited (
) might not have the largest market cap around , it saw significant share price movement during recent months on the ASX, rising to highs of AU$16.97 and falling to the lows of AU$13.84. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Super Retail Group's current trading price of AU$13.84 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Super Retail Group’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.
According to our price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average, the stock price seems to be justfied. We’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 11.92x is currently trading slightly below its industry peers’ ratio of 14.35x, which means if you buy Super Retail Group today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe Super Retail Group should be trading in this range, then there isn’t much room for the share price to grow beyond the levels of other industry peers over the long-term. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Super Retail Group’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.
Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Though in the case of Super Retail Group, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting earnings growth of 0.5%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term.
 It seems like the market has already priced in SUL’s growth outlook, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at SUL? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below the industry PE ratio?
 If you’ve been keeping tabs on SUL, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the positive growth outlook may mean it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.
With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. At Simply Wall St, we found 
 and we think they deserve your attention.

Dividend stocks, such as MyState and others on the ASX, can offer potential avenues for steady income in this dynamic economic landscape. In considering what makes a good dividend stock, factors like consistent performance across various market conditions and strong underlying financial health become particularly relevant. These characteristics can provide some resilience against market volatility and contribute to reliable dividend payouts.

Super Retail Group's recent dividend of A$0.32 per share aligns with its historical pattern of fluctuating dividends, reflecting a payout ratio of 65.5% and cash payout ratio of 28.6%.

However, its dividend yield of 3.13% is relatively low compared to the top Australian dividend payers at 6.27%. Recent inclusion in the S&P/ASX All Ordinaries and Emerging Companies Indexes may influence investor perception but does not directly impact dividend stability or growth.

Estimating The Intrinsic Value Of Super Retail Group Limited (ASX:SUL) 2024-07-01T20:16:57.000Z

Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Super Retail Group Limited (
) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!
We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the 
 may be something of interest to you.
We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:
 = AU$1.9b
The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.3%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.7%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$153m× (1 + 2.3%) ÷ (7.7%– 2.3%) = AU$2.9b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$2.9b÷ ( 1 + 7.7%)
= AU$1.4b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is AU$3.2b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of AU$13.6, the company appears about fair value at a 4.4% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.
Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Super Retail Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.191. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to "what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For Super Retail Group, we've put together three further elements you should look at:

Lindsay Australia And 2 Other ASX Dividend Stocks To Watch 2024-07-02T19:09:34.000Z

Over the past year, the Australian market has shown a steady increase of 7.5%, maintaining a flat trajectory in just the last week, with expectations for earnings to grow by 13% annually. In this environment, dividend stocks like Lindsay Australia can be particularly appealing for their potential to offer both stability and income growth.
Here's a peek at a few of the choices from the screener.
 ★★★★☆☆
 Lindsay Australia Limited operates in Australia, offering integrated transport, logistics, and rural supply services primarily to sectors like food processing and horticulture, with a market capitalization of A$293.68 million.
 Lindsay Australia Limited generates revenue primarily through its transport and rural supply operations, totaling A$571.38 million and A$158.73 million respectively.
 6.4%
Lindsay Australia's dividend profile presents a mixed scenario. Despite a 50.3% earnings growth last year, the firm's dividend track record has been unstable with volatile payments over the past decade. Currently, dividends yield at 6.38%, slightly below the top tier in Australia's market. However, both earnings and cash flows substantiate its dividends with payout ratios at 43.7% and 38.9%, respectively, indicating reasonable coverage and sustainability moving forward.
 ★★★★☆☆
 New Hope Corporation Limited, with a market cap of A$4.37 billion, is engaged in the exploration, development, production, and processing of coal, as well as oil and gas properties.
 New Hope Corporation Limited generates A$1.88 billion from its Coal Mining NSW operations and A$48.15 million from its Coal Mining QLD, including Treasury and Investments.
 8.3%
New Hope's dividend yield stands at a robust 8.32%, ranking in the top quartile of Australian dividend stocks, yet its sustainability is questionable with dividends poorly covered by cash flows (90.2% cash payout ratio). Over the past decade, dividends have shown volatility and unreliability, despite a low earnings payout ratio of 48.4%. The stock trades at a significant discount to estimated fair value (-32.4%), but future earnings are expected to decline annually by 6.4%. Recent board changes include the resignation of Director Todd James Barlow and appointment of Brent Charles Albert Smith, potentially impacting governance and strategic direction.
 ★★★★☆☆
 Super Retail Group Limited operates in Australia and New Zealand, specializing in the retail of auto, sports, and outdoor leisure products with a market capitalization of approximately A$3.06 billion.
 Super Retail Group Limited generates revenue through its segments, with Super Cheap Auto contributing A$1.48 billion, Rebel at A$1.30 billion, and Boating, Camping and Fishing (excluding Macpac) earning A$876 million, alongside Macpac's A$220.60 million.
 5.6%
Super Retail Group's dividend history shows variability with significant annual drops, making its reliability questionable for consistent income. Despite this, dividends are adequately covered by earnings and cash flows, with a payout ratio of 65.5% and a cash payout ratio of 28.6%. Trading at 4.9% below estimated fair value suggests attractiveness relative to peers, yet its dividend yield of 5.61% falls short compared to top Australian dividend payers. Forecasted average earnings decline of 0.4% annually over the next three years could pressure future payouts.

Charter Hall Group And Two Other ASX Dividend Stocks To Consider 2024-07-17T19:06:22.000Z

The Australian market has shown robust performance recently, with a 2.1% increase over the last week and a notable 10% rise over the past year, complemented by an anticipated annual earnings growth of 13%. In this thriving environment, dividend stocks like Charter Hall Group offer potential for investors looking for steady income combined with capital appreciation opportunities.
Here's a peek at a few of the choices from the screener.
 ★★★★★☆
 Charter Hall Group, listed on the ASX under the ticker CHC, operates as a prominent Australian property investment and funds management group with a market capitalization of approximately A$6.07 billion.
 Charter Hall Group generates revenue primarily through its funds management segment, which brought in A$515.60 million, and its property investments segment, contributing A$142.20 million.
 3.4%
Charter Hall Group offers a moderate dividend yield of 3.44%, which is below the top quartile of Australian dividend stocks. Despite lower profit margins this year at 11.7% compared to last year's 42.9%, its dividends are well-supported, with a payout ratio of 43.8% and a cash payout ratio of 45.3%. The company has maintained stable and reliable dividends over the past decade, with an anticipated earnings growth rate of 18.28% per year, suggesting potential for future dividend sustainability and growth.
 ★★★★☆☆
 New Hope Corporation Limited, operating in the energy sector, focuses on the exploration, development, production, and processing of coal and oil and gas properties with a market capitalization of approximately A$4.18 billion.
 New Hope Corporation Limited generates revenue primarily through its coal mining operations in New South Wales and Queensland, totaling approximately A$1.88 billion and A$0.05 billion respectively.
 8.7%
New Hope's dividend yield of 8.7% ranks in the top quartile for Australian stocks, yet its reliability is questionable due to a history of volatility and lack of coverage by earnings and cash flows. Recent corporate actions include a A$300 million fixed-income offering and executive changes, with Brent Charles Albert Smith joining as director. Despite trading below fair value, forecasted average earnings decline of 7.3% annually over the next three years may challenge future dividend sustainability.
 ★★★★☆☆
 Super Retail Group Limited operates in the retail sector, specializing in auto, sports, and outdoor leisure products across Australia and New Zealand, with a market capitalization of approximately A$3.27 billion.
 Super Retail Group Limited generates revenue through its diverse retail segments, with Super Cheap Auto (SCA) contributing A$1.48 billion, Rebel at A$1.30 billion, Boating, Camping and Fishing (BCF) earning A$876 million, and Macpac adding A$220.60 million.
 5.2%
Super Retail Group has seen a decade of fluctuating dividends, with recent years marked by increases. Despite this, the company maintains a sustainable payout ratio of 65.5% and a low cash payout ratio at 28.6%, indicating strong coverage by both earnings and cash flows. However, its dividend yield at 5.25% remains below the Australian market's top dividend payers. Additionally, Super Retail Group trades at a favorable P/E ratio of 12.5x compared to the broader Australian market average of 19.3x, suggesting relative undervaluation amidst concerns over an expected earnings decline of 0.4% annually over the next three years.

Super Retail Group (ASX:SUL) Is Increasing Its Dividend To A$0.69 2023-09-03T22:19:45.000Z

 (
) dividend will be increasing from last year's payment of the same period to A$0.69 on 18th of October. This makes the dividend yield about the same as the industry average at 6.0%.
Solid dividend yields are great, but they only really help us if the payment is sustainable. Prior to this announcement, Super Retail Group's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.
Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to fall by 10.7% over the next year. If the dividend continues along the path it has been on recently, the payout ratio in 12 months could be 106%, which is definitely a bit high to be sustainable going forward.
The company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from A$0.32 total annually to A$0.78. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 9.3% over that duration. A reasonable rate of dividend growth is good to see, but we're wary that the dividend history is not as solid as we'd like, having been cut at least once.
Growing earnings per share could be a mitigating factor when considering the past fluctuations in the dividend. Super Retail Group has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 12% per annum. The company is paying a reasonable amount of earnings to shareholders, and is growing earnings at a decent rate so we think it could be a decent dividend stock.
Overall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Super Retail Group is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. The distributions are easily covered by earnings, and there is plenty of cash being generated as well. However, it is worth noting that the earnings are expected to fall over the next year, which may not change the long term outlook, but could affect the dividend payment in the next 12 months. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.
It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Just as an example, we've come across 
 you should be aware of, and 1 of them is concerning. If you are a dividend investor, you might also want to look at our

Declining Stock and Solid Fundamentals: Is The Market Wrong About Super Retail Group Limited (ASX:SUL)? 2023-10-02T00:54:04.000Z

With its stock down 7.2% over the past month, it is easy to disregard Super Retail Group (ASX:SUL). However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Particularly, we will be paying attention to 
 ROE today.
Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Super Retail Group is:
19% = AU$263m ÷ AU$1.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).
The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every A$1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of A$0.19.
So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or "retain", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
To start with, Super Retail Group's ROE looks acceptable. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 20%. Consequently, this likely laid the ground for the decent growth of 19% seen over the past five years by Super Retail Group.
We then performed a comparison between Super Retail Group's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 20% in the same 5-year period.
Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is Super Retail Group fairly valued compared to other companies? These 
 might help you decide.
Super Retail Group has a significant three-year median payout ratio of 66%, meaning that it is left with only 34% to reinvest into its business. This implies that the company has been able to achieve decent earnings growth despite returning most of its profits to shareholders.
Moreover, Super Retail Group is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 68%. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 17%.
In total, we are pretty happy with Super Retail Group's performance. In particular, its high ROE is quite noteworthy and also the probable explanation behind its considerable earnings growth. Yet, the company is retaining a small portion of its profits. Which means that the company has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's not too bad. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

Super Retail Group's (ASX:SUL) 48% return outpaced the company's earnings growth over the same one-year period 2023-10-16T02:05:18.000Z

The simplest way to invest in stocks is to buy exchange traded funds. But one can do better than that by picking better than average stocks (as part of a diversified portfolio). For example, the 
 (
) share price is up 37% in the last 1 year, clearly besting the market return of around 3.5% (not including dividends). That's a solid performance by our standards! Zooming out, the stock is actually 
 1.7% in the last three years.
On the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns.
In his essay 
 Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.
Super Retail Group was able to grow EPS by 9.0% in the last twelve months. This EPS growth is significantly lower than the 37% increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it a year ago.
You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).
This 
 interactive report on Super Retail Group's 
 is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.
As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Super Retail Group, it has a TSR of 48% for the last 1 year. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!
We're pleased to report that Super Retail Group shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 48% over one year. That's including the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 13% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Even so, be aware that

Super Retail Group Limited's (ASX:SUL) 7.1% gain last week benefited both individual investors who own 41% as well as insiders 2023-10-30T02:34:39.000Z

A look at the shareholders of Super Retail Group Limited (
) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are individual investors with 41% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.
Individual investors gained the most after market cap touched AU$2.9b last week, while insiders who own 30% also benefitted.
Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Super Retail Group, beginning with the chart below.
Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.
We can see that Super Retail Group does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Super Retail Group's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.
Super Retail Group is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is Reginald Rowe, with ownership of 28%. Challenger Limited is the second largest shareholder owning 5.0% of common stock, and Alphinity Investment Management Pty Ltd. holds about 4.9% of the company stock.
We did some more digging and found that 10 of the top shareholders account for roughly 51% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat.
Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
It seems insiders own a significant proportion of Super Retail Group Limited. Insiders own AU$862m worth of shares in the AU$2.9b company. That's quite meaningful. Most would say this shows a good degree of alignment with shareholders, especially in a company of this size. You can 
With a 41% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Super Retail Group. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should learn about the

What Is Super Retail Group Limited's (ASX:SUL) Share Price Doing? 2023-11-13T03:18:47.000Z

While Super Retail Group Limited (
) might not be the most widely known stock at the moment, it saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the ASX. As a stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine Super Retail Group’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity.
The share price seems sensible at the moment according to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 11.68x is currently trading in-line with its industry peers’ ratio, which means if you buy Super Retail Group today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Super Retail Group’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.
Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Though in the case of Super Retail Group, it is expected to deliver a negative earnings growth of -6.3%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. It appears that risk of future uncertainty is high, at least in the near term.
 SUL seems priced close to industry peers right now, but given the uncertainty from negative returns in the future, this could be the right time to de-risk your portfolio. Is your current exposure to the stock beneficial for your total portfolio? And is the opportunity cost of holding a negative-outlook stock too high? Before you make a decision on SUL, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.
 If you’ve been keeping an eye on SUL for a while, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. This means there’s less benefit from mispricing. In addition to this, the negative growth outlook increases the risk of holding the stock. However, there are also other important factors we haven’t considered today, which can help crystallize your views on SUL should the price fluctuate below the industry PE ratio.

Does Super Retail Group (ASX:SUL) Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist? 2024-01-03T23:23:02.000Z

Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.

Super Retail Group Limited's (ASX:SUL) Intrinsic Value Is Potentially 94% Above Its Share Price 2024-01-18T00:00:16.000Z

Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Super Retail Group Limited (ASX:SUL) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.
We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the 
.
We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:
 = AU$3.2b
After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.7%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$436m× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.7%– 2.1%) = AU$7.9b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$7.9b÷ ( 1 + 7.7%)
= AU$3.7b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is AU$7.0b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of AU$15.9, the company appears quite good value at a 49% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.
The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Super Retail Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.130. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to "what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For Super Retail Group, we've put together three pertinent elements you should consider:

Super Retail Group's (ASX:SUL) Returns Have Hit A Wall 2024-02-25T00:32:16.000Z

If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? Firstly, we'll want to see a proven 
 on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding 
 of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. With that in mind, the ROCE of 
 (
) looks decent, right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.
If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Super Retail Group is:
0.18 = AU$422m ÷ (AU$3.4b - AU$1.1b) 
.
Thus, 
 That's a pretty standard return and it's in line with the industry average of 18%.
In the above chart we have measured Super Retail Group's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our 
 
.
The trend of ROCE doesn't stand out much, but returns on a whole are decent. The company has consistently earned 18% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 85% in that time. 18% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that Super Retail Group has consistently earned this amount. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.
In the end, Super Retail Group has proven its ability to adequately reinvest capital at good rates of return. And the stock has done incredibly well with a 190% return over the last five years, so long term investors are no doubt ecstatic with that result. So even though the stock might be more "expensive" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research.

Super Retail Group Limited (ASX:SUL) Looks Like A Good Stock, And It's Going Ex-Dividend Soon 2024-03-01T04:20:06.000Z

 (
) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in 4 days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Meaning, you will need to purchase Super Retail Group's shares before the 6th of March to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 12th of April.
The company's next dividend payment will be AU$0.32 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed AU$0.76 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Super Retail Group stock has a trailing yield of around 4.7% on the current share price of AU$16.31. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing.
Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Super Retail Group paid out more than half (65%) of its earnings last year, which is a regular payout ratio for most companies. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 39% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.
It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.
Click 
Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. For this reason, we're glad to see Super Retail Group's earnings per share have risen 12% per annum over the last five years. Super Retail Group has an average payout ratio which suggests a balance between growing earnings and rewarding shareholders. Given the quick rate of earnings per share growth and current level of payout, there may be a chance of further dividend increases in the future.
The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Super Retail Group has lifted its dividend by approximately 7.2% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.
Should investors buy Super Retail Group for the upcoming dividend? Super Retail Group's growing earnings per share and conservative payout ratios make for a decent combination. We also like that it paid out a lower percentage of its cash flow. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research.
While it's tempting to invest in Super Retail Group for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. To help with this, we've discovered 
 that you should be aware of before investing in their shares.

Super Retail Group Limited's (ASX:SUL) Fundamentals Look Pretty Strong: Could The Market Be Wrong About The Stock? 2024-03-17T22:00:56.000Z

It is hard to get excited after looking at Super Retail Group's (ASX:SUL) recent performance, when its stock has declined 8.7% over the past month. But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Super Retail Group's ROE today.
Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Super Retail Group is:
19% = AU$262m ÷ AU$1.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).
The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every A$1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated A$0.19 in profit.
We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or "retain", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
To begin with, Super Retail Group seems to have a respectable ROE. Even when compared to the industry average of 17% the company's ROE looks quite decent. Consequently, this likely laid the ground for the decent growth of 17% seen over the past five years by Super Retail Group.
As a next step, we compared Super Retail Group's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 18% in the same period.
The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about Super Retail Group's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.
The high three-year median payout ratio of 66% (or a retention ratio of 34%) for Super Retail Group suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of its income to its shareholders.
Additionally, Super Retail Group has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 68% of its profits over the next three years. As a result, Super Retail Group's ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 17% for future ROE.
Overall, we are quite pleased with Super Retail Group's performance. Especially the high ROE, Which has contributed to the impressive growth seen in earnings. Despite the company reinvesting only a small portion of its profits, it still has managed to grow its earnings so that is appreciable. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

Investing in Super Retail Group (ASX:SUL) five years ago would have delivered you a 165% gain 2024-04-03T04:41:33.000Z

When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average. And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. For example, the 
 (
) share price is up 96% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 26% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 32% in the last year , including dividends .
So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.
There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.
During five years of share price growth, Super Retail Group achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 12% per year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 14% per year. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.
You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).
This 
 interactive report on Super Retail Group's 
 is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.
As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Super Retail Group, it has a TSR of 165% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!
It's nice to see that Super Retail Group shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 32% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 22% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered

Individual investors are Super Retail Group Limited's (ASX:SUL) biggest owners and were hit after market cap dropped AU$176m 2024-04-19T21:06:03.000Z

Every investor in Super Retail Group Limited (
) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 47% stake, individual investors possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
While insiders who own 29% came under pressure after market cap dropped to AU$3.3b last week,individual investors took the most losses.
Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Super Retail Group, beginning with the chart below.
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Super Retail Group. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Super Retail Group's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.
Super Retail Group is not owned by hedge funds. Reginald Rowe is currently the company's largest shareholder with 28% of shares outstanding. Challenger Limited is the second largest shareholder owning 4.7% of common stock, and The Vanguard Group, Inc. holds about 3.5% of the company stock.
A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.
While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.
Our information suggests that insiders maintain a significant holding in Super Retail Group Limited. It has a market capitalization of just AU$3.3b, and insiders have AU$978m worth of shares in their own names. That's quite significant. Most would be pleased to see the board is investing alongside them. You may wish to 
With a 47% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Super Retail Group. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.
I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 
 you should know about.

Is There Now An Opportunity In Super Retail Group Limited (ASX:SUL)? 2024-05-06T02:47:34.000Z

While Super Retail Group Limited (
) might not have the largest market cap around , it saw significant share price movement during recent months on the ASX, rising to highs of AU$16.97 and falling to the lows of AU$13.84. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Super Retail Group's current trading price of AU$13.84 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Super Retail Group’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.
According to our price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average, the stock price seems to be justfied. We’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 11.92x is currently trading slightly below its industry peers’ ratio of 14.35x, which means if you buy Super Retail Group today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe Super Retail Group should be trading in this range, then there isn’t much room for the share price to grow beyond the levels of other industry peers over the long-term. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Super Retail Group’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.
Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Though in the case of Super Retail Group, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting earnings growth of 0.5%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term.
 It seems like the market has already priced in SUL’s growth outlook, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at SUL? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below the industry PE ratio?
 If you’ve been keeping tabs on SUL, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the positive growth outlook may mean it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.
With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. At Simply Wall St, we found 
 and we think they deserve your attention.

Exploring MyState And Two More ASX Dividend Stocks 2024-05-16T20:05:55.000Z

Amid a generally positive trend in the Australian market, with the ASX200 recently closing up by 1.6% and most sectors showing gains, investors may be looking for stable investment opportunities. Dividend stocks, such as MyState and others on the ASX, can offer potential avenues for steady income in this dynamic economic landscape. In considering what makes a good dividend stock, factors like consistent performance across various market conditions and strong underlying financial health become particularly relevant. These characteristics can provide some resilience against market volatility and contribute to reliable dividend payouts.
Let's review some notable picks from our screened stocks.

Trading at 26.2% below its estimated fair value and with earnings forecast to grow by 7.23% annually, MyState offers potential for investors seeking income with moderate growth prospects despite past inconsistencies in payouts.

 5.6%
Super Retail Group's recent dividend of A$0.32 per share aligns with its historical pattern of fluctuating dividends, reflecting a payout ratio of 65.5% and cash payout ratio of 28.6%. Despite an unstable dividend track record over the past decade, current dividends are supported by earnings and cash flows. The company's stock trades at a significant discount to estimated fair value, offering relative value in comparison to industry peers.

However, its dividend yield of 3.13% is relatively low compared to the top Australian dividend payers at 6.27%. Recent inclusion in the S&P/ASX All Ordinaries and Emerging Companies Indexes may influence investor perception but does not directly impact dividend stability or growth.

Estimating The Intrinsic Value Of Super Retail Group Limited (ASX:SUL) 2024-07-01T20:16:57.000Z

Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Super Retail Group Limited (
) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!
We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the 
 may be something of interest to you.
We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:
 = AU$1.9b
The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.3%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.7%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$153m× (1 + 2.3%) ÷ (7.7%– 2.3%) = AU$2.9b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$2.9b÷ ( 1 + 7.7%)
= AU$1.4b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is AU$3.2b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of AU$13.6, the company appears about fair value at a 4.4% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.
Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Super Retail Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.191. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to "what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For Super Retail Group, we've put together three further elements you should look at:

Lindsay Australia And 2 Other ASX Dividend Stocks To Watch 2024-07-02T19:09:34.000Z

Over the past year, the Australian market has shown a steady increase of 7.5%, maintaining a flat trajectory in just the last week, with expectations for earnings to grow by 13% annually. In this environment, dividend stocks like Lindsay Australia can be particularly appealing for their potential to offer both stability and income growth.
Here's a peek at a few of the choices from the screener.
 ★★★★☆☆
 Lindsay Australia Limited operates in Australia, offering integrated transport, logistics, and rural supply services primarily to sectors like food processing and horticulture, with a market capitalization of A$293.68 million.
 Lindsay Australia Limited generates revenue primarily through its transport and rural supply operations, totaling A$571.38 million and A$158.73 million respectively.
 6.4%
Lindsay Australia's dividend profile presents a mixed scenario. Despite a 50.3% earnings growth last year, the firm's dividend track record has been unstable with volatile payments over the past decade. Currently, dividends yield at 6.38%, slightly below the top tier in Australia's market. However, both earnings and cash flows substantiate its dividends with payout ratios at 43.7% and 38.9%, respectively, indicating reasonable coverage and sustainability moving forward.
 ★★★★☆☆
 New Hope Corporation Limited, with a market cap of A$4.37 billion, is engaged in the exploration, development, production, and processing of coal, as well as oil and gas properties.
 New Hope Corporation Limited generates A$1.88 billion from its Coal Mining NSW operations and A$48.15 million from its Coal Mining QLD, including Treasury and Investments.
 8.3%
New Hope's dividend yield stands at a robust 8.32%, ranking in the top quartile of Australian dividend stocks, yet its sustainability is questionable with dividends poorly covered by cash flows (90.2% cash payout ratio). Over the past decade, dividends have shown volatility and unreliability, despite a low earnings payout ratio of 48.4%. The stock trades at a significant discount to estimated fair value (-32.4%), but future earnings are expected to decline annually by 6.4%. Recent board changes include the resignation of Director Todd James Barlow and appointment of Brent Charles Albert Smith, potentially impacting governance and strategic direction.
 ★★★★☆☆
 Super Retail Group Limited operates in Australia and New Zealand, specializing in the retail of auto, sports, and outdoor leisure products with a market capitalization of approximately A$3.06 billion.
 Super Retail Group Limited generates revenue through its segments, with Super Cheap Auto contributing A$1.48 billion, Rebel at A$1.30 billion, and Boating, Camping and Fishing (excluding Macpac) earning A$876 million, alongside Macpac's A$220.60 million.
 5.6%
Super Retail Group's dividend history shows variability with significant annual drops, making its reliability questionable for consistent income. Despite this, dividends are adequately covered by earnings and cash flows, with a payout ratio of 65.5% and a cash payout ratio of 28.6%. Trading at 4.9% below estimated fair value suggests attractiveness relative to peers, yet its dividend yield of 5.61% falls short compared to top Australian dividend payers. Forecasted average earnings decline of 0.4% annually over the next three years could pressure future payouts.

Charter Hall Group And Two Other ASX Dividend Stocks To Consider 2024-07-17T19:06:22.000Z

The Australian market has shown robust performance recently, with a 2.1% increase over the last week and a notable 10% rise over the past year, complemented by an anticipated annual earnings growth of 13%. In this thriving environment, dividend stocks like Charter Hall Group offer potential for investors looking for steady income combined with capital appreciation opportunities.
Here's a peek at a few of the choices from the screener.
 ★★★★★☆
 Charter Hall Group, listed on the ASX under the ticker CHC, operates as a prominent Australian property investment and funds management group with a market capitalization of approximately A$6.07 billion.
 Charter Hall Group generates revenue primarily through its funds management segment, which brought in A$515.60 million, and its property investments segment, contributing A$142.20 million.
 3.4%
Charter Hall Group offers a moderate dividend yield of 3.44%, which is below the top quartile of Australian dividend stocks. Despite lower profit margins this year at 11.7% compared to last year's 42.9%, its dividends are well-supported, with a payout ratio of 43.8% and a cash payout ratio of 45.3%. The company has maintained stable and reliable dividends over the past decade, with an anticipated earnings growth rate of 18.28% per year, suggesting potential for future dividend sustainability and growth.
 ★★★★☆☆
 New Hope Corporation Limited, operating in the energy sector, focuses on the exploration, development, production, and processing of coal and oil and gas properties with a market capitalization of approximately A$4.18 billion.
 New Hope Corporation Limited generates revenue primarily through its coal mining operations in New South Wales and Queensland, totaling approximately A$1.88 billion and A$0.05 billion respectively.
 8.7%
New Hope's dividend yield of 8.7% ranks in the top quartile for Australian stocks, yet its reliability is questionable due to a history of volatility and lack of coverage by earnings and cash flows. Recent corporate actions include a A$300 million fixed-income offering and executive changes, with Brent Charles Albert Smith joining as director. Despite trading below fair value, forecasted average earnings decline of 7.3% annually over the next three years may challenge future dividend sustainability.
 ★★★★☆☆
 Super Retail Group Limited operates in the retail sector, specializing in auto, sports, and outdoor leisure products across Australia and New Zealand, with a market capitalization of approximately A$3.27 billion.
 Super Retail Group Limited generates revenue through its diverse retail segments, with Super Cheap Auto (SCA) contributing A$1.48 billion, Rebel at A$1.30 billion, Boating, Camping and Fishing (BCF) earning A$876 million, and Macpac adding A$220.60 million.
 5.2%
Super Retail Group has seen a decade of fluctuating dividends, with recent years marked by increases. Despite this, the company maintains a sustainable payout ratio of 65.5% and a low cash payout ratio at 28.6%, indicating strong coverage by both earnings and cash flows. However, its dividend yield at 5.25% remains below the Australian market's top dividend payers. Additionally, Super Retail Group trades at a favorable P/E ratio of 12.5x compared to the broader Australian market average of 19.3x, suggesting relative undervaluation amidst concerns over an expected earnings decline of 0.4% annually over the next three years.
