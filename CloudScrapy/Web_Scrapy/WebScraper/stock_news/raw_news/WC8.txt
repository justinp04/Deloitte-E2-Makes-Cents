Watch These Meta Price Levels as Stock Pops on Earnings Beat as AI Spending Pays Off 2024-08-01T02:00:13.000Z

Shares in Facebook Parent Surged More than 7% in Extended Trading on Wednesday
Shares in Meta Platforms (
) jumped more than 7% in extended trading on Wednesday after the social media giant's 
 topped Wall Street’s estimates, giving investors confidence that the company’s significant investment in 
 infrastructure is reaping benefits.
The tech behemoth's stock price has fluctuated significantly after recent quarterly reports. In February, the shares surged more than 20% on Q4 results amid the declaration of the company’s first ever 
, while light second-quarter revenue guidance sparked a drop of over 10% following Q1 earnings in April.
Below, we take a closer look at Meta’s chart and use 
 to identify key levels to watch out for.
Since the stock’s earnings-driven 
 in early February, the price has remained in a 
, fluctuating several times above and below the 50-day moving average (MA), indicating a lack of clear direction.
A move to a new 
 above the rangebound period in July was short lived, with the shares retracing to the lower portion of the range leading into the social media giant’s quarterly results.
Looking ahead, investors should monitor two key levels that the stock could test amid a post-earnings pop.
The first sits around $490, a location on the chart near the 50-day MA where sellers may look to book profits near a 
 that links several minor 
 that have formed throughout the rangebound period. Although after-hours trading indicates an open higher than this level, it’s worth watching if the shares can hold above this area through Thursday’s close.
Follow-through buying could see a retest of $530, where the price would likely encounter significant overhead 
 around the April and July 
, Until the price decisively breaks out above these two peaks, the later which marks the stock’s record high, there’s the ongoing possibility of a 
.
If the Meta shares go on to break out above the trading range, investors can use the 
, sometimes called a measured move, to project a potential price target.
To do this, we calculate the distance between the range’s two trendlines in 
 and add that amount to its top trendline. In this case, we add $110 to $530, which forecasts a price target of $640.
Meta shares rose 7.2% to $508.87 in after-hours trading Wednesday.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call
, 
Hello, and welcome to Teladoc Health's second quarter 2024 earnings call. My name is Lydia, and I'll be your operator today. After the prepared remarks, there'll be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator instructions] I'll now hand you over to Michael Minchak, head of investor relations at Teladoc Health to begin.
Please go ahead.

Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by saying how excited I am to have joined Teladoc Health and to lead the organization going forward. The company has many strengths to build upon and to drive higher levels of execution and performance. I'll comment on the quarter's results, but also want to share some early perspectives since joining the company in June.
I've had the opportunity to engage with employees across the organization and visit with many customers and stakeholders, including recently attending our annual forum event, which brought together healthcare leaders, virtual care advocates, and innovators. These discussions have further reinforced my optimism about the future. I've been impressed by the depth of talent and resiliency of our employees and the level of commitment to serving our customers, members, and patients. I'm also gratified to see such a strong focus on patient safety, clinical quality, and health equity, as well as an organizational understanding of the importance of more holistically supporting the physical and mental health needs of people.
Not only are these important aspects from a care perspective, but also represent key points of differentiation in the marketplace to build upon. From a technology perspective, we have important capabilities that will be essential to driving the business going forward, including our member-to-provider matching engines, our ability to effectively manage millions of patients and provider interactions, and the investments we've made in the areas of data science and artificial intelligence. Together with other capabilities that we're working toward, this will position us well to meet the evolving needs of our customers and the healthcare system. And it further underscores the need to ensure we're achieving the expected impact of these investments, which is an area I expect us to further strengthen in short order.
We also have scaled business and leading brands that are well-recognized in the marketplace. Over 92 million people in the U.S. have access to one or more of our products today, and we intend to increase our ability to serve additional needs over time. I'm also excited about our success and market potential internationally, including the strong results and momentum that our international teams are delivering.
All of that said, this is a company that is not yet delivering on its fullest potential. Since joining the company seven weeks ago, I've been evaluating, together with the team, all aspects of our business, our strategic direction and priorities, our product offerings in terms of current performance and market potential, the outlook for our business units, and where we can drive improved performance and long-term shareholder value. And we will be acting on opportunities accordingly. From an operating perspective, I see an ability to strengthen execution, streamline the organization, and further raise the bar on performance.
For example, the challenges noted earlier in the year had a real impact on our business at that time but can also continue to influence results after resolution. This is what I mean by raising the bar on performance, and we're working with focus and urgency to ensure that we execute with a higher level of precision going forward. In terms of streamlining the organization, actions are already underway, including making changes to ensure we are organized to best serve our markets, clarifying and reinforcing accountabilities and deliverables, and scrutinizing our cost structure with an eye toward greater cost efficiency as we deliver for both customers and shareholders now and into the future. With respect to cost savings initiatives that we've already shared previously, the company is on target for achieving both 2024 and 2025 commitments, which Mala will comment on further.
Through these and other actions, we intend to strengthen decision making, accelerate the pace of innovation and speed to market, and unlock greater value over time. This has been and continues to be a key area of focus since joining the company and I look forward to providing further updates going forward. I'll turn to our second quarter results and provide some brief comments before handing over to Mala for more detail. In total, we reported consolidated revenues in the second quarter within the company's previous guidance range, along with overall adjusted EBITDA above the range.
Our integrated care business achieved solid business and financial results, including on both a top-line and adjusted EBITDA basis. In the U.S., integrated care members have grown by nearly 3 million people since the beginning of the year, including 600,000 on a sequential quarter basis. International business continued to grow and create further expansion opportunities. I'm also pleased to see additional ways that our teams are working together across our various businesses to create new areas of differentiation for Teladoc Health.
From a commercial perspective, three quarters of our bookings in the second quarter came from cross-selling into our existing book of business, continuing the momentum we've seen over the past several quarters with the remainder coming from new clients. Our chronic care bundled solutions are generating solid interest from new and existing clients, and we remain focused on increasing our product penetration to serve more people. Shifting to BetterHelp, we're proud of the work the team is doing to support the mental health and well-being of people. The business is serving well over 1 million unique individuals on an annual basis and has a net promoter score of over 70.
While it is resonating with consumers who are paying out of pocket for the services today, the operating environment remains challenging, and elevated customer acquisition costs continue to impact both top- and bottom-line results. We see BetterHelp as a business in transition, one with a market leading position, but needing to find additional ways to reach more people who can benefit from the service while also balancing scale, growth and financial performance. Several initiatives are being pursued to positively impact results going forward, ranging from furthering international expansion, pursuing insurance coverage access in the U.S., and continued product enhancements. We'll provide a further update on the actions we're taking to the business and the third quarter call, but also believe it's appropriate at this point to modify our guidance approach as we navigate through these changes and challenges.
Mala will comment more on BetterHelp in a moment. In closing, let me say that we are operating with a strong sense of urgency and have intensified our efforts on both the opportunities ahead of us and in strengthening execution and performance. Through our leadership position in the marketplace, our talented and committed employees, and our value proposition, we expect to deliver for our customers and drive the long-term potential and success of the organization. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mala to review our second quarter results and our outlook.
 -- 
Thank you, Chuck, and good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter consolidated revenue of $642 million decreased 2% year over year. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $89.5 million, which was above the high end of our guidance range and up 24% year over year, representing a margin of 13.9%. Consolidated net loss per share in the second quarter was $4.92 compared to a net loss per share of $0.40 in the second quarter of 2023.
Net loss per share in the second quarter included a noncash goodwill impairment charge of $4.64 per share, amortization of acquired intangibles of $0.38 per share, and stock-based compensation expense of $0.25 per share. The goodwill impairment testing was triggered by the decline in Teladoc Health's share price with the impairment amount impacted by a higher discount rate and lower forecasted cash flows, and particularly the impact of challenges at BetterHelp. Second quarter free cash flow was $60.9 million compared to $64.6 million in the second quarter of 2023. Excluding a nonrecurring, nonincome tax refund in the prior-year quarter, free cash flow was up approximately 25%.
We ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash and equivalents on the balance sheet. Turning to our segment results, integrated care segment revenue increased 5% year over year to $377 million in the second quarter. Chronic care was a key contributor to this year-over-year revenue growth. We ended the quarter with chronic care program enrollment of $1.17 million, up 9% year over year and up 5% sequentially.
The largest drivers of chronic care enrollment growth versus the prior year period were our diabetes prevention and weight management programs, followed by hypertension. As an example of the continued success we are seeing with our land-and-expand strategy, we recently upgraded the fully insured population at a large regional Blues plan from our diabetes management solution to Diabetes Plus, and expanded it to all fully insured members, while also securing a hunting license for our newly launched advanced weight management solution for the self-insured population. In addition to enrollment growth, we also saw a benefit in the quarter from performance-based revenue in our chronic care programs, where we are earning fees for successfully delivering on outcomes. While these types of arrangements currently represent a smaller portion of our business, we believe that our ability to deliver positive results in value-based arrangements will remain an important lever going forward.
International was also an important contributor with strong revenue growth in the quarter, driven by our B2B business, while we are also seeing success in leveraging our hospital and health systems offerings to unlock new public health system opportunities. U.S. integrated care segment membership at the end of the quarter was 92.4 million members, increasing by 8% year over year and up by a by approximately 600,000 members sequentially in line with our guidance range. Average integrated care revenue per U.S.
member of $1.36 decreased by $0.05 versus the prior-year second quarter. This is driven by mix as we have onboarded a significant number of new members within our general medical product. And typically, they contribute less material to our average revenue per member. As we have said, based on our land-and-expand strategy, we see significant runway to cross-sell additional higher revenue products over time, including our chronic care services.
Second quarter integrated care adjusted EBITDA was $64 million, a 69% increase over the second quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 17% was well above our guidance range of 12% to 14% and represented growth of approximately 640 basis points versus the second quarter of 2023. Three factors helped to contribute to the upside versus the guidance range in the quarter. The first was the performance-based revenue in our chronic care programs.
The second factor was adjustments to compensation accruals, in line with current year performance, including lower than expected performance in our BetterHelp business. And the third part is related to timing, as certain marketing and other operating expenses were pushed into the second half of the year. In aggregate, these three factors accounted for over 300 basis points of benefit to year-over-year margin expansion. Turning to the BetterHelp segment, revenue was $265 million in the second quarter, down 9% versus the prior-year period and slightly below our guidance range of down 4% to 8%.
Revenue was down 1.5% versus the first quarter of 2024, as average paid users declined by 1.9% sequentially, with average revenue per user generally stable and churn in the first half of 2024 improving versus the second half of 2023. The decline in revenue and users versus the first quarter was a result of fewer user additions to the platform. We've talked about how a variety of factors influence the revenue yield on advertising spend, including cost of media, the overall health of the consumer, and dynamics within the advertising channels themselves. In the first quarter, we saw challenging customer acquisition costs through early Q1, which caused us to pull back on our advertising dollars in the quarter in keeping with our goals to balance growth and margin.
Although we entered the second quarter with lower paid users, creating headwinds to our top-line performance, we did see signs of advertising costs stabilizing at Q1 levels in the first few weeks. However, we saw a further deterioration from those levels in May, with that trend continuing into June. To help put this in context, we saw a double-digit percentage increase in customer acquisition costs in May versus what we had seen exiting the first quarter. In line with our strategy to constantly optimize for return on advertising spends, we made the decision to pull back during the second quarter to ensure the appropriate level of return for marginal dollar spend.
This led to fewer gross additions and a lower paid user count, which drove the revenue decline in the quarter. We believe higher customer acquisition costs in the U.S. are being driven by several factors. First, we are seeing customer acquisition costs pressure broadly across many of our advertising channels, which suggest some broader macro weakening of the consumer.
Next, BetterHelp growth is dependent on our ability to efficiently deploy marketing dollars to acquire new customers. Our scale makes us the largest advertiser of virtual mental health. And while our spending is diversified across various channels, there is only so much incremental ad spend we can drive in a short period of time without further inflating our customer acquisition costs. At our scale, and at these elevated levels of customer acquisition costs, we are making a conscious decision not to chase inefficient customer acquisition to points below an appropriate return.
So, this balanced approach and focus on driving ROI and margin is going to come at a lower overall rate of top-line growth as long as customer acquisition costs in our key advertising channels remain elevated. As we have noted, BetterHelp is a business in transition. We are undertaking several strategic pivots to address these challenges and expand our addressable market. As Chuck had discussed, we are actively working on bringing the BetterHelp value proposition to the insurance market.
In addition, we are also moving forward with further international expansion beyond our current footprint with a focus on certain non-English speaking markets. Consistent with our prior commentary, we have seen much healthier customer acquisition costs in non-U.S. markets, which is translating to strong international revenue growth at BetterHelp. BetterHelp adjusted EBITDA was $25 million in the second quarter, representing a 26% year-over-year decline.
Adjusted EBITDA margin of 9.6% was just above the midpoint of our guidance range of 9% to 10% and decreased 210 basis points versus the prior-year quarter. As we faced higher than expected customer acquisition costs, we made the deliberate decision to moderate advertising spend in certain channels during the quarter, which allowed us to meet our adjusted EBITDA margin target and was consistent with our focus on managing the business to an appropriate return on ad spend. Now, let me turn to guidance. For integrated care, we continue to expect 2024 revenue growth in the low to mid single digits.
We are narrowing our range for adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, which we now expect to be up 150 to 200 basis points. Our guidance reflects the first half performance, offset by a slower ramp in chronic care Enrollment, primarily related to client driven delays in the launch of certain member populations, which will likely lead to chronic care enrollment being relatively flat on a sequential basis in the third quarter. We are raising the lower end of our U.S. integrated care member guidance range and now expect 92.5 million to 94 million members at year-end.
For the third quarter, we expect integrated care revenue to be down 1% to up 2%, and adjusted EBITDA margin between 14.5% and 16%. U.S. integrated care members are expected to be in the range of 92.5 million to 93.5 million members. We note that the deceleration in year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter is due in part to a tougher comp due to the realization of performance guarantees in the third quarter of 2023, which added approximately 100 basis points of growth and adjusted EBITDA margin in the prior-year period, as well as impacts from lower chronic care enrollment.
For BetterHelp, customer acquisition costs have continued to trend higher over the past few quarters, and there is limited visibility on the near term path, which as we have discussed, could be further affected by the unknown impact of the upcoming presidential election on ad pricing. Based on actions we are taking as we actively manage the business for an appropriate return on ad spend, while at the same time positioning the business and brand for long-term success, this is leading to an atypically wide range of potential outcomes. Therefore, we are choosing to not provide segment revenue or adjusted EBITDA guidance for the third quarter. And we are withdrawing our full year guidance for both metrics in our BetterHelp segment at this time.
We recognize the challenge this presents from a modeling standpoint. Therefore, to provide a baseline, we note that if customer acquisition costs continue at current levels, we would expect second half 2024 revenue to decline in the low double digits. Consistent with our decision to not provide guidance for the BetterHelp segment, we are, therefore, not providing guidance for the consolidated company, revenue, adjusted EBITDA, net loss per share, or free cash flow for the third quarter or full year 2024. We continue to make progress executing against our cost-saving productivity initiatives, and we remain on track to deliver $43 million in cost savings on a GAAP basis for our business in 2024 and a total of $85 million in 2025.
As we look to 2025 and beyond, there are a number of initiatives that will inform our longer term outlook, including the areas mentioned by Chuck. While our focus remains on driving sustainable financial performance and value creation, we are not in a position to provide a longer-term forecast for our segments or an outlook for the full company, including for 2025 at the current time. With that, I will turn the call back to Chuck.
 -- 
Thanks, Mala. The decision to withdraw our long-term guidance comes as I continue to evaluate all aspects of the business, including our strategic priorities, our cost structure, investments in the business, our product offerings, and capital allocation. I look forward to sharing further details on our third quarter earnings call in October. With that, we will open it up for questions.
Operator?
[Operator instructions] Our first question today comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
 -- 
Thanks very much. Good afternoon. Chuck, I'm going to start with a comment that was in the press release, and that was, you know, unlocking greater value across the entire company. As I listened to your comments and Mala's comments around BetterHelp, should I think that BetterHelp is maybe not strategically a component of the company going forward and, potentially, this would be in better hands of somebody else owning this.
If that's not the way you should think about it, what are some of the other things we should be thinking about in that comment of this greater opportunity across the company?
 -- 
Yeah, thank you for the question. I think with respect to BetterHelp, you know, it's important to note that the company has really built a great capability. It's the largest of its kind, serving well over 1 million people, you know, great results with consumers who are paying out of pocket. So, all of that is, you know, terrific.
I think that the operating challenges Mala's touched on and you're well aware of. I think at this point, you know, BetterHelp is an important part of the company. We're primarily focused right now on managing through this transition period, advancing the deliverables that Mala touched on in terms of international expansion, insurance market, other enhancements, and balancing the scale and financial strength of the company and financial performance. With that said, like any business, we're going to continue to evaluate what we're doing, where we're operating in a way that creates long-term shareholder value.
When I'm talking about unlocking value, when you look across our businesses, there's opportunities. And there already are some synergies being realized today, but there are opportunities to do more. You've got a consumer business that has resonated well, and we have need for engagement in our B2B business. We have a scaled B2B business that can benefit from other parts of the organization as well.
So, what I'm looking for is each individual business to meet the market needs and realize its own potential, but as part of the broader company, where are those opportunities to unlock new value and differentiate. I think there's a number of areas that we're going to explore.
Thank you. Our next question is from Stephanie Davis with Barclays. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Chuck, Mala, you both talked of pursuing insurance coverage for BetterHelp in your prepared marks. So, I'd like for you to talk a little bit more about that.
What are the steps that you'll need to take to make an insurance reimbursed product versus your current out-of-pocket construct? How is that going to compare to my strengths? And what are the approximate timelines for taking these steps? Thank you.
 -- 
Yeah, I'll start and then Mala can add to this. You know, from my perspective, this is what I see as the next logical step for BetterHelp. You know, we've got a lot of eyes on the product, but as people work through the process, a significant number, a significant percentage of those consumers that don't choose to move forward cite high out-of-pocket costs, as well as having insurance coverage. So, we want to be able to those consumers, to offer the ability to access their coverage where we can.
In terms of timeline, we're working on deliverables right now to have at least what we call the technical capabilities by year-end to be able to offer that. Obviously, with insurance contracting and so forth, it'll be rolling out over the course of 2025. As you note, there's some additional requirements, additional credentialing, there's other requirements, operational contracting, etc. The way we're approaching that, I think, is a very thoughtful way, where areas where we want to control the experience, which are key to the experience, we're handling those, but we're also leveraging third-party partners for areas that we don't see as core to that experience.
That increases the speed to market, reduces the investments we need to make to bring it live. So, we see that as a manageable upfront investment in terms of building out the capability. But we do see this as a logical progression. But again, I would underscore, it's primarily focused on meeting that consumer need that we have their eyes on the product now, but they want to be able to access their insurance coverage.
 -- 
Yeah, and, Stephanie, what I'd add to what Chuck said is, if you take a step back and think about our efforts for offering insurance, look BetterHelp, mission has always been to make mental healthcare more accessible to everyone. And affordability is the main reason users, as they go through sort of the path to enroll with BetterHelp, don't convert. And it's honestly the No. 1 cause for customer churn.
If you think about the macros that we are dealing with, if you think about, you know, softening consumer spend, inflation, etc., we have an opportunity to actually expand our TAM quite significantly if we were to sort of expand beyond cash pay. So, that's sort of the -- you know, we are being very thoughtful on how we approach this. We are looking thoughtfully into the modalities each step of what we do to implement and execute this with precision, with rigor, and to make sure that from an investment standpoint, we are getting the appropriate return on investments that we will make in this space.
 -- 
Thanks so much.
Our next question comes from Jess Tassan with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
 -- 
Thanks for taking the question, and congrats, Chuck, on starting in the role. I wanted to get maybe your perspective, just having come from a health plan, how would you kind of rank the Teladoc chronic care platform today among competitors in the market? And what are kind of the biggest issues or like low-hanging fruit that you think you can address? And then, a quick follow-up would be, of the people who have access to a Teladoc chronic care solution, how many are actually eligible for enrollment, so have a condition that can be resolved or ameliorated by the chronic care platform? It was easy when Livongo was just diabetes, you know, 12%, but I'm curious what that number is today. Thanks.
 -- 
Yeah, I'll take a stab at it and then Mala can comment further. From a market perspective, you know, from a former customer perspective, I think the company's chronic care products are effective. And we were a purchaser of that in my prior role. I like the way that the company approaches a more comprehensive model as opposed to targeting just a specific situation that they're really being thoughtful in terms of what else that member needs.
As you know, with chronic conditions, a lot of cases, it's more than one condition in play. And like most things with people, it's bigger than just one matter that they are wrestling with. So, I like the comprehensive approach that the company takes and that resonated with me. In terms of where I see our position relative to others, I would highlight that.
I would say that we have more opportunities to create services that can benefit those patients. And I think the journey the company's been on in terms of where it's headed with its weight and obesity management is a good example of that. I think, ultimately, you've got a sophisticated buyer, if you will, out there and they are looking for demonstrated value. They are looking for measurements against that.
I think we've done a nice job with both our chronic care models in terms of ROI and our new cardiometabolic health value model that was validated by Milliman. So, I guess I would say that I think we've got a nice approach. It's resonating in the market. It's comprehensive, and it is demonstrating value.
And the last thing I would say, but, Mala, if you want to add anything, if you look at the impact we're having on the patients that do engage, it's pretty impressive. So, I think we're in a good position there, but obviously more to build upon.
 -- 
Yeah. And to answer your second question, Jess, look, here's the good news, right? We are continuing to see strength in the number of recruitables that we have, right? The recruitables momentum continues. And I would say, you know, that is testament to our product offerings, the fact that we are seeing strength in selling chronic care bundles increasingly. If you think about our overall chronic care bookings, more than half of it was chronic care bundles.
The reason I mention this is, if you think about, you know, your question around, how are we doing in converting those recruitables into chronic care enrollees, we don't give the actual number in terms of enrollment, but it continues to be strong and increase relative to what you quoted as the enrollment numbers in the Livongo days. And the reason for that is, if you think about our ability increasingly to sell chronic care bundles to clients, what happens when you do that is, you know, you will see enrollees essentially enroll into multiple conditions, use multiple off our programs rather than say one diabetes program, etc. And all of that helps from an enrollment perspective.
 -- 
Thank you.
Our next question comes from Jailendra Singh with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Thank you, and thanks for taking my questions. Given we are in the heart of the selling season, I was wondering if you could speak to what you are seeing in terms of RFP activity in your integrated care segment, employer interest. Last year, I believe, employers were likely caught off guard, primarily because of GLP-1 costs, which likely resulted in sales cycle generally getting elongated. Curious what you guys are seeing this year.
And maybe spend some time on your provider-led weight management program and traction that it's getting, given GLP-1 still remains on top of mind for most employers.
 -- 
Yes. Thank you for the questions. A couple of things. In terms of the selling season, if you will, I think we're feeling really good about that at this point overall.
The sales teams are progressing on both bookings, as well as actively managing pipeline opportunities. And as I mentioned before, I mean I think what we're seeing in the market, generally is good activity. But a sophisticated buyer base that's looking for, again, raising the bar in terms of demonstrated value, they are definitely looking for ways to reduce fragmentation, so I think at least having a more effective experience versus all these point solutions, so that's definitely a trend and theme out there. I think that -- so we're seeing good activity across the board, and we'll continue to go after that.
I think with respect to the weight and obesity management, obviously as you know, that's a significant area of focus, particularly with employers, not just with GLP-1, but just how to manage this issue more holistically. I think there's a range of approaches out there, and I think it's a little early to see kind of how those all play out. I think what we're trying to play is a place where we can create customized options for employers depending on what they are trying to solve. And as you note to, you know, all the way up to our most advanced program which includes physician access, a Teladoc physician, that's trained in obesity management.
So, I think we're seeing a lot of interest there, maybe even perhaps more than we probably thought coming into the year. But it's early in this whole process, and I think what we're trying to do is make sure we're there for the long haul, so that the approach we're taking and the impact we're making is something that's sustainable versus something that's maybe, perhaps, a quick fix.
 -- 
Thanks, Chuck.
Our next question comes from Richard Close with Cannacord Genuity. Your line is open.
 -- 
Yes, thanks for the questions. And good to talk with you Chuck in your first call here. Mala, I was curious on the charge, if you could just go into a little bit of the details on the BetterHelp component of that, just that process. And then my follow-up is on BetterHelp.
If you get insurance coverage, are you thinking about leveraging that into the existing employer book of business, which I would assume would be really low acquisition cost for BetterHelp?
 -- 
Yeah, so let me do it in reverse order, Richard. Thank you for your questions. You know, when Chuck talked earlier to Lisa's questions around where is -- you know, what do we mean in terms of synergies across the business, and Chuck spoke about BetterHelp leveraging the B2B side of the business, what you just said is one of the examples that I would cite in terms of, you know, go-to-market for how we are thinking about BetterHelp with insurance. And what do I mean by that? The fact is, look, if you think about the strength of the client relationships we have, we have talked about our client retention rate being over 90%.
We have long-standing, good relationships with our clients, and this is an opportunity for us to actually use that to your point, in a smart efficient way with the BetterHelp product. Obviously, there are things we need to do to make sure that the BetterHelp platform and product is suitable for the B2B space, and we just talked about that a few minutes ago. So, that's on your second question. On your first question around the charge, look, as I said in the prepared remarks, the impairment charge essentially was the -- for us to take a look at impairment, it's really triggered by the decline in share price.
And then, it's sort of -- as I said, the drivers for the impairment charge really are the discount rate, as well as cash flows. And if you think about the BetterHelp business and the fact that our revenues are lower and our adjusted EBITDA is lower than what we had expected, it's not really a surprise that, you know, we do have to take the impairment. So, those are the factors that really went into us coming to the impairment charge that we did. The last thing I would say is, maybe one of the things that is implied in your question is, how is it sort of on the BetterHelp side? If you think about it from an accounting perspective, when we broke out into segments a couple of years ago, we essentially allocated the goodwill across both the segments based on value, and that is the reason why you are seeing the goodwill charge on the BetterHelp side.
 -- 
OK, thank you.
Our next question is from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Hi, guys. Thanks so much for the question. I was wondering if you could comment on current BetterHelp tax as we are in the third quarter. And if not, I was also wondering if you could talk about the lower member growth that you talked about due to delays in enrollment and integrated care in the second half of the year.
Can you give us a little bit more color on sort of what's causing those delays and what are your updated expectations for when those members come onboard? Thank you.
 -- 
Yeah, so I'll take them in order Elizabeth. In terms of the customer acquisition cost for BetterHelp, the reason we sort of moved away from giving guidance is as we have talked about. As we went through the quarter in Q2, relative to the expectations that we had about customer acquisition costs upon entering the quarter, you know the tax was certainly a lot higher. We've talked about double-digit relative growth relative to the first quarter.
So, the customer acquisition costs were a lot higher. And we are not seeing at this moment a lot of improvement or change relative to that trajectory for all of the reasons that we cited in the prepared remarks, right? We are diversified in terms of channels within the BetterHelp business, but we are the largest advertiser in the space. You know, we are the most scaled business, and for us to drive revenue growth, we would have to deploy incremental ad spend, but it is harder and harder to do that efficiently and more importantly profitably. And as we balance top-line growth with return on ad spend and efficiency, that certainly increasingly becomes a challenge.
So, we continue to see elevated levels of customer acquisition costs. We have limited visibility into how those will play out as we go through the rest of the year. You combine that with softening macros and so we felt the range of outcomes is just too large for us to provide guidance. So, that's sort of on the customer acquisition costs.
On the chronic care enrollees, a couple of points to make. One is, the client -- the launch -- the delays in client launches really are into 2025. And so, we would expect to enroll those members really in next year, not in the back half of this year. The other thing I would just comment, and maybe, Chuck, you want to add more to this in terms of your mindset and philosophy from an execution standpoint, I do think there is an opportunity for us to continue to get better in conversion, in enrollment to execute better and better as we sort of get more data.
Do this for an increasing amount of time, and that is also something that we certainly are taking a very hard look at from an execution perspective. Chuck, I don't know if you'd like to add.
 -- 
Yeah, I think you said it well. I think this is an example of what we mean by raising the bar on performance and execution. And this space is, as an example is, taking an end-to-end look at how we're performing, how do we get the information we need, how do we leverage it, how do we reach out and engage, how do we measure each step of that process so that we are maximizing our potential in terms of the eligibles that are in front of us. So, I think that's something you are going to see from us is just continue to make sure that the processes we have and the operating model is delivering and performing as we expect.
 -- 
Thank you.
Our next question comes from Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Thank you. Can you clarify if the increase in advertising pricing is increasing evenly across all of the channels, or if there are outliers where maybe a mix shift could be beneficial? Then, when you talk about your strategy of not chasing customer acquisitions, does that mean that you are prioritizing holding the ratio of advertising and marketing to revenue flat from the level here? Or should we think about it as more of direction on your total dollar spend on advertising being more flattish? Thank you.
 -- 
Yeah. So, let me address them in turn. The things that I would say on the channels, the various channels, what we saw as we went through the second quarter is the following. We did see heightened costs in our nonauction channel.
So, if you think about podcasts, channels like that, we did see elevation in pricing in those channels to some extent relative to the first quarter, where we did see quite significant increase in our customer acquisition costs was in the auction channel. You know, if you think about the dynamics of how ad spend works across these different channels Sarah, the non-auction channels typically are somewhat gated in terms of capacity. And so, where we really have a lot more flexibility in deploying ad spend is in the auction channel, paid search, etc. So, that is really where we saw quite a significant increase in our customer acquisition costs, but we did see some elevation even in the nonauction channels.
And that's one of the things I cited in my prepared remark, that the elevation in pricing across all of these channels leads us to believe that certainly there is consumer pressure, there are macro softening, because we are seeing that pressure across all of the channels. In terms of how we are essentially managing this business for BetterHelp, I'm not going to speak to adjusted EBITDA for the back half or for the full year, just given the fact that we have withdrawn our guidance, and we've chosen to withdraw our guidance. What I would say is the following. We are -- it's not like we are leaving profitable revenue dollars on the table.
What we are attempting to do and doing is essentially optimized return on ad spend, so that if you think about the returns on the marginal dollar of revenue, it is not unprofitable. So, that is what we mean when we say we are not chasing revenue for revenue sake, we are balancing top-line end revenue with bottom line.
 -- 
Thank you.
The next question today comes from Sean Dodge with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Yeah, thanks. Mala, you mentioned three factors benefiting margins in the quarter. The first one you called out I think was a performance fee you received related to the chronic care business. Can you quantify for us how much that contributed? And then, I think you also mentioned the timing of a shift in ad marketing spend related to what you were just talking about, that was pushed from Q2 into the back half of the year.
I was wondering if you could quantify that for us as well. Thanks.
 -- 
Yeah. So, look, what we have said in the prepared remarks is, you know, we were -- we saw an adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 640 basis points year over year. The three factors that we cited contributed to roughly about 340 basis points in total. So, excluding that, we would have expanded our margins by 300 basis points.
Still very healthy relative to what we generally expect on average. The only thing I would say, Sean, is, off that 340 basis points, the factor of performance based revenues was roughly, call it about half of that or slightly less than half of that. So, about 150 basis points was around performance based revenue.
 -- 
OK, that's helpful. Thank you.
The next question comes from Charles Rhyee with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Yeah, thanks for taking the question. Mala, I know you've mentioned, you are not deciding guidance here on BetterHelp. But just historically, if we think about the cadence that we've seen over the last couple years, you've talked about sort of using ad spend for the second and third quarters, kind of ramping that down in the fourth quarter then to sort of harvest the margin. And so, historically, at least over the last couple years, fourth quarter has been sort of the biggest EBITDA quarter in terms of dollars for BetterHelp.
But given sort of what you're seeing now in terms of CAC, customer acquisition cost, it looks like in 3Q as well, should we still expect sort of that seasonal pattern for EBITDA? Or should we think about EBITDA maybe being a little bit more sequentially flattish in the fourth quarter? Would you expect sort of that historical pattern still to sort of be evident?
 -- 
Yeah, thank you, Charles. Here's what I would say to you. I think that given the fact that we typically historically have pulled back on ad spend in the fourth quarter for an important reason, the holiday pricing season for ad spend tends to be relatively inefficient. And I would say, if you combine that with what may happen, you know, leading up to the elections.
Again, this is -- we have limited visibility into how customer acquisition costs are going to go. But if you look at what has happened in terms of holiday pricing, I would expect that, obviously, to continue this year. And that certainly will have, will weigh in on our decision on how much to spend in the fourth quarter. I would also say, as always, we would balance that with setting ourselves up for 2025 in a reasonable manner from a top-line growth perspective and a user perspective.
So, again, what I'm saying is no different from the different considerations we put into the mix every single year. I would say our thinking would be along the same lines as we go through the year.
Our next question comes from Mike Cherny with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. Maybe if we can go back relative to the removal of the multiyear targets, I understand given all the commentary you've had so far regarding BetterHelp, why you would do that. That being said, is the intention still to run the business as if those were the targets you were pushing for? Or are you using this as a potential pivot point to make any drastic changes? I know someone earlier had asked about the long-term future of BetterHelp. I'm just thinking about, operationally, how you are thinking about running the organization, managing the organization, given this elevated level of uncertainty with what I'm hearing is still a little bit lack of visibility in terms of when it can turn around.
 -- 
Yeah, so, we'll address that in two ways, specific to BetterHelp, and then, you know, what it means. Obviously, BetterHelp is an important contributor to our overall, you know, financial, revenue profit, as well as free cash flow. So, as it relates to BetterHelp, look it's a business in transition. And because we have limited near-term visibility, I think what's important for us to do is to really manage the business in a very disciplined way, to balance top line and bottom line, not chase revenue growth for revenue growth sake.
Really look at optimizing our return on ad spend, while preparing the business to make the strategic pivot that we need to make. Those include the international expansion, which is going well relative to our expectations that we had as we went into the year. We are making progress and going deeper into the English-speaking markets. We are looking into judiciously expanding into some non-English-speaking markets.
So, far, you know, the revenue per user and customer acquisition costs that we are seeing are in line with expectations, in line with what we had gone into this expansion with. So, that's on international. We have talked about BetterHelp with insurance. You know, we are looking at other strategic pivots in this business, and I think it is important for us to balance the shorter term of how we stabilize the, what I call the U.S.
consumer business, the core business, with managing all of these pivots, from a leadership perspective, from a bandwidth perspective of the management team at BetterHelp, as well as from an investment perspective. So, that is, I would say, on the BetterHelp side. I would say more broadly, you know, from an integrated care standpoint, we've reaffirmed our 2024 guidance on revenue. You've talked about bringing down the low end of the adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, still a healthy margin expansion year over year, 150 to 200 basis points.
Under Chuck's leadership, we are, you know, taking a serious look at many different things from a structure and a management perspective of the business. We are clarifying accountability, and that's really going to help us prioritize our investments for growth. So, you know, Chuck has spoken in his remarks on how he's taking a comprehensive look across all aspects of the business. And that's the process that's going to take a little bit of time.
So, we wanted to just give him the ability to go through that, to complete that in a thoughtful way. And, you know, we will come back to you all in terms of what that means, in terms of an updated outlook over the coming months.
Our next question comes from Daniel Grosslight with Citi. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to clarify that the chronic care enrollment delay, that's separate from the technical issue you mentioned last quarter. And then, my real question is on how you are thinking about performance guarantees and really value-based care and population health going forward.
I understand it's a small part of the business right now. But, Chuck, given your experience building out value-based care asset set guide well, I'm curious how you are thinking about leveraging that experience to take a more clinical risk, not necessarily this year but maybe '25, '26, and beyond. Thanks.
 -- 
Yeah, well I'll hit the second part and then Mala can comment. Yeah, I do think back to the customer base and the sophisticated buyers and expecting more and more in terms of performance measurements and outcomes, that aligns well with what we've been doing as a company and what we are and will be building out in terms of a more complete picture to manage patients. So, I think those things are going to converge, where you're going to see, one, our capabilities expand, which are already strong today, but there's additional elements as we move forward, and a convergence with the customer base in the marketplace that is expecting and demanding more value-based measurements and willing to put more of the economics in play, if you will, and allow a company like ours to participate in the value that we are able to create. So, I think both of those are going to be an important part of the future for us and for other organizations like us.
Mala, would you add anything?
 -- 
No, I'll just hit the first part of your question, Daniel. Look, the issues and the challenges that we had at the beginning of the year were really related more to the client mapping, you know, data mapping on our client hierarchy. That is really -- we've solved for that. That's behind us.
What I will say is, and Chuck sort of mentioned this in his prepared remarks, I do think that as we move forward, it is important that we don't have execution methods like that, because it does certainly mean that we have to get over the challenges that create from a results perspective, relative to the plans that we have. And so, you know, as we are beginning to work with Chuck, we are certainly spending time as a leadership team looking at our internal structures, our governments, etc. That is really going to prevent us from having those kinds of methods.
 -- 
Got it. Thank you.
Thank you. We're now out of time for any further questions so this concludes the Q&A session, as well as the conference call. Thank you everyone for joining. [Operator signoff]

Mark Zuckerberg sees a WhatsApp boom in the U.S. as a game changer 2024-08-01T03:29:47.000Z

WhatsApp is the most popular messaging app in the world with
 around the globe, but it’s never quite caught on with American audiences.
CEO Mark Zuckerberg, whose 
 bought the app for $19 billion in 2014, really wants to reverse that trend, he said
 on Wednesday. And if more U.S. users convert to WhatsApp, it could mean a sea change for the
, said Zuckerberg. Meta previously announced that the app had crossed a milestone of 100 million monthly active users in the U.S.
“The WhatsApp stat, I think, is really important as a business trend, just because the United States punches above its weight in terms of—it's such a large percent of our revenue,” said Zuckerberg during the call. “All of the work that we're doing to grow the business opportunity… over time is just going to have a big tailwind if the U.S. ends up being a big market so that's one reason why it's really relevant.”
A breakdown of Meta's 
 shows that the U.S. and Canada represented 38% of its total $39 billion in revenues this quarter, while revenues from Asia, Europe and the rest of the world accounted for the rest.
WhatsApp is part of Meta’s “family of apps,” which includes flagship social networking platform Facebook, Instagram, Facebook messenger, and Threads. Revenue for that segment was $38.7 billion in the quarter, up 22%. Meta reported net profits of $13.5 billion this quarter, notching a more than 70% rise over the same period last year.
As for WhatsApp, Zuckerberg said that as the app has begun to make inroads with U.S. users, people have begun to realize, “Hey, this is a really good experience,” he said, which could kick off as more people try out group-chat functions and cross-platform communication.
“It's obviously also personally somewhat gratifying to see all the people around us starting to use WhatsApp,” said Zuckerberg. “So that's pretty fun, but maybe less relevant from a business perspective.”

 -- 
Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. In the June quarter, Lam delivered another set of solid results with revenues, profitability, and earnings per share, all coming in above the midpoint of our guidance. Our CSBG business posted strong growth with revenues up 22% sequentially, led by Reliant and spares. On the manufacturing side, we achieved a key milestone in the quarter with our Malaysia factory shipping its 5,000th chamber.
This is the fastest ramp of a new manufacturing facility in Lam's history, and we remain on track to achieve our long-term cost reduction goals through an expanded global manufacturing and supply chain footprint. As previously communicated, 2024 is a year of strategic investment for Lam, where we are prioritizing product development for key technology inflections, global R&D infrastructure close to our customers, and digital transformation for operational efficiency at scale. We believe these investments will put Lam in a position to outperform as the industry moves into a period of multi-year WFE spending expansion. Now, turning to WFE, we expect this year's spending to be in the mid $90 billion range.
Our customer investment profile is generally unchanged from our prior view, apart from slightly stronger domestic China spending and additional demand related to the ramp of high-bandwidth memory or HBM capacity. We see Foundry/Logic, DRAM, and NAND investments all up on a year-on-year basis. Global spending on mature node technologies is expected to be roughly flat year on year. Looking ahead to 2025, we see a positive environment for continued growth in WFE spending.
The power of AI is a transformative business tool is still yet to be fully realized. Today, the focus on AI model training is driving strong demand for GPUs and HBM. However, as AI use cases expand, we believe inferencing at the edge will spur content growth of low-power DRAM and NAND storage in enterprise PCs and smartphones. Investments for AI-enabled edge devices play particularly well to Lam's strengths.
We anticipate that memory customers looking to scale capacity and lower bid cost will bias WFE spending toward technology upgrades of the installed base. For NAND, the etch and deposition intensity of upgrades is significantly higher than in a greenfield investment. When you consider Lam's sizable installed base in memory, including roughly 7,500 high aspect ratio dielectric etch chambers for NAND alone, we are positioned to outgrow overall WFE when customers upgrade existing memory production lines to next-generation nodes. Longer term, etch and deposition are set to play an increasingly vital role in the industry's efforts to develop faster, more power-efficient, and lower-cost semiconductors to serve AI-related applications by delivering critical solutions for atomic-level device scaling, new materials innovation, and advanced packaging integration, we see tremendous opportunity for Lam to expand our served market and increase our share at each successive process technology node.
To this end, our R&D focus is yielding exciting new products, including this year, our first direct power coupled conductor etch tool with matchless power source and bias, known as Direct Drive. This new power source uses solid-state drivers to stabilize the plasma in the etch chamber 500 times faster than current industry standards. By combining direct power coupling with Lam's unique plasma pulsing capabilities, our latest conductor etch systems are delivering best-in-class performance for newly emerging 4F2 DRAM applications. In 4F2 devices, the nature of the bit line placement requires precise etching of ultra-small high aspect ratio of silicon structures to avoid device shorts or leakage.
With direct power coupling and plasma pulsing, Lam connects to vertically oriented 4F2 transistor architectures with unprecedented depth uniformity and profile controller. Similarly, conductor etch is becoming a critical enabler for EUV patterning for gate-all-around and DRAM due to the need to reduce etch placement error. For nodes below two nanometers, the requirement is for roughly 40% tighter control than at five nanometers. Our new conductor etch tool delivers a 30% reduction in feature roughness, which is one of the main contributors to etch placement error.
In addition, we can achieve one to two orders of magnitude improvement in defectivity for a given EUV dose, further helping customers reduce the overall cost and improve the capability of the EUV patterning process. Turning to NAND. AI applications are driving demand for faster, higher-capacity enterprise SSDs. NAND makers are pursuing both vertical and lateral scaling of NAND arrays as well as increasing bits stored per sell through implementation of QLC and PLC technologies.
In support of these efforts, Lam is developing new dielectric etch and deposition capabilities. Earlier today, we announced Lam Cryo 3.0, Lam's third generation of cryogenic etch technology. Building on our learning from nearly 1,000 cryogenic etch chambers, running in NAND fabs worldwide. This new patented cryogenic etch process delivers industry-leading control of the NAND memory channel hole profile.
When Lam Cryo 3.0 is deployed on our Vantex system, the etch are delivering the industry's highest available ion energy, we can create a 10-micron deep channel hole that has a top-to-bottom profile deviation of less than 10 nanometers or less than 0.1% relative to its depth. Such tight profile control allows customers to increase bit density by packing more cells per layer while also having the flexibility to add more layers per tier. Lam Cryo 3.0 also addresses our industry's need for more sustainable solutions, delivering a 40% reduction in energy consumption per wafer and a 90% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions per wafer compared to non-cryogenic etchers. Deposition technology is also advancing quickly to support increased bit density and lower cost through multi-tier stacking.
Polysilicon and tungsten gap-fill materials have typically been used to enable tier stacking in high-layer-count NAND. Integration of these materials, however, has resulted in poor control of critical dimensions and overlay, negatively impacting yield and performance. Ram's innovative PECVD-based pure carbon and gap-fill process provides an attractive alternative material. With the unique combination of high etch selectivity, superior mechanical properties, and simplified dry post-process removability, it also reduces the number of process steps required in some cases by approximately 50% compared to traditional approaches.
Overall, etch and deposition are becoming increasingly critical to addressing the complex semiconductor requirements of a growing AI environment. We are excited by the breadth of opportunities we see ahead for the company, especially those created by technology inflections to gate-all-around backside power delivery, advanced packaging, and dry EUV resist processing. All of these are etch and deposition intensive and each represents a $1 billion or higher growth opportunity for Lam. We look forward to sharing our progress on these fronts as well as our long-term financial model at our next Investor Day, which we are planning to hold in February 2025.
With that, I'll turn it over to Doug.
 -- 
Great. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. We executed well in the June 2024 quarter.
Our June quarter results came in above the midpoint or exceeded our guidance ranges for all financial metrics. We were pleased with the company's strong execution. For fiscal year 2024, we achieved the highest gross margin percentage since the merging of Lam with Novellus in 2013, coming in at 48.2% and we generated quite strong free cash flow of approximately $4.3 billion or 29% of revenue. Let's look at the details of our June quarter results.
Revenue came in at $3.87 billion, which was an increase from the prior quarter and over the midpoint of guidance. Our deferred revenue balance at the end of the quarter was -- or excuse me, $1.55 billion, which is a decrease of $194 million in the March quarter related to revenue recognized that was tied to customer advanced payments. As we sit here today, I believe deferred revenue remains stable at these levels for the foreseeable future. Let's turn to the revenue segment details.
June quarter systems revenue in memory was 36%, which was a decrease from the prior quarter level of 44%. The decline in the memory segment was mainly attributable to DRAM. DRAM came in at 19% of systems revenue compared with 23% in the March quarter as investments in mature nodes declined in the June quarter. DRAM revenue reached a new record in fiscal year 2024 with spending focused on DDR5 and HBM enablement as well as on the 1Y node.
Nonvolatile memory came in at 17% of our systems revenue, which was down from the March quarter level of 21%. And just a reminder, we are characterizing one customer's investment in specialty DRAM as a nonvolatile investment since it has a nonvolatile component in the device. NAND revenue was at a low point for this year, and I expect NAND investment to gradually improve as utilization rates return to more normal levels and our customers slowly increased spending in conversions to 2xx and 3xx layer devices into the next year. The Foundry segment represented 43% of our systems revenue, which was roughly flat with the percentage concentration in the March quarter of 44%.
Growth in shipments for gate-all-around nodes was offset by a decline in mature node spending. The Logic and other segment were 21% of system revenue in the June quarter, up from the prior level of 12%. The increase was driven by strength in mature node spending in China. With respect to the regional composition of our total revenue, the China region came in at 39%, down slightly from the prior quarter level of 42% and a little bit higher than our expectations from the previous earnings call.
This was driven by domestic China spending. The next largest geographic concentration was Korea at 18% of revenue in the June quarter, versus 24% in the March quarter. Taiwan was 15% of revenue in the June quarter, which was an increase from 9% in the March quarter. The customer support business group revenue in the June quarter pulled approximately $1.7 billion, an increase of 22% from the prior quarter level and 14% higher than the June quarter and calendar 2023.
CSBG revenue represented 44% of our June quarter revenues and reached the highest point since the end of calendar 2022, driven primarily by an increase in Reliant Systems, followed by growth in spares. Our Reliant Systems revenue benefited from strength in domestic China spending for specialty and mature nodes. Spares revenue increased largely due to continued improvement in utilization at our memory customers as well as a little bit of inventory stocking. I do not think CSBG will grow modestly in calendar year 2024.
Let's look at profitability. Our June quarter gross margin came in at 48.5% at the top end of our guided range and slightly down from 48.7% in the March quarter. June quarter gross margin benefited from continued improvement in factory efficiencies, which largely offset the headwind we saw in customer mix that we talked about on the last earnings call. Operating expenses for the June quarter were $689 million, down marginally from the prior-quarter amount of $698 million.
As Tim mentioned, we continue to prioritize spending in research and development to extend our technology differentiation as well as expand our product portfolio. I'd just point out that more than 70% of our total operating expenses were concentrated in research and development. The June quarter operating margin was 30.7%, above the guidance range mainly because of that strong gross margin performance. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 11.5%.
We estimate the tax rate for the remainder of the calendar year 2024 to be in the low to mid-teens level, and this rate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Other income and expense for the June quarter was approximately $19 million in income compared with $10 million in income in the March quarter. The increase in OI&E was primarily the result of fluctuations in the fair value of our venture investments. And as we've talked about in the past, you will see variability in OI&E quarter to quarter.
Let's look at the capital return. We allocated approximately $382 million to share repurchases, and we paid $261 million in dividends in the June quarter. During the quarter, we announced that our board of directors approved a $10 billion share repurchase authorization. We have $10.8 billion remaining in the plan at the end of the June quarter.
For fiscal year 2024, we returned $3.7 billion or 88% of free cash flow, which was in line with our long-term capital plans of returning 75% to 100% of free cash flow. June quarter diluted earnings per share were $8.14, close to the high end of our guidance range. The diluted share count was 131 million shares on track with our expectations and down from the March quarter. Let's look at the balance sheet.
Cash and cash equivalents totaled $5.9 billion at the end of the June quarter, up a little bit from $5.7 billion at the end of the March quarter. Days sales outstanding were 59 days in the June quarter, a slight increase from 57 days in the March quarter. June quarter inventory turns of 1.9x compared with 1.8x in the prior quarter. We are making progress in bringing inventory levels down, and we'll continue to work on this throughout the rest of calendar year 2024.
Our noncash expenses for the June quarter included approximately $79 million for equity compensation, $74 million in depreciation, and $14 million in amortization. Capital expenditures were $101 million, flat with the March quarter level was spending mainly centered on lab investments in the United States and Asia as well as manufacturing facilities in Asia, supporting our global strategy to be close to our customers' development and manufacturing locations. We ended the June quarter with approximately 17,200 regular full-time employees, which was flat with the prior quarter. Let's turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the September 2024 quarter.
We're expecting revenue of $4.05 billion, plus or minus $300 million. Gross margin of 47%, plus or minus one percentage point. This gross margin decline is reflective primarily of an unfavorable quarter-to-quarter change in customer mix. I expect this change to continue to be a slight incremental headwind in the December quarter.
Operating margins of 29.5%, plus or minus one percentage point. Gross margin and operating margin included impact from ongoing transformation costs related to projects to improve our systems and operations. As we communicated at the beginning of the year, we're focused on reengineering our business processes and systems to drive operational efficiencies and to implement AI at greater scale. And finally, we're forecasting earnings per share of $8 plus or minus $0.75 based on a share count of approximately 131 million shares.
Let me wrap up. As we finish the first half of calendar year 2024, I was pleased that we were able to execute to the objectives we shared at the beginning of the year. We prioritize investment to extend our technology differentiation while driving operational improvements. We're encouraged that the spares business recovery is beginning, and upgrade activity should improve as we exit the calendar year.
Longer term, Lam is well-positioned to capitalize the increase in etch and deposition intensity by delivering new capabilities and multiple new manufacturing inflections that we see ahead. We look forward to talking to you in February at our planned Investor Day about the long-term opportunities for Lam to continue our outperformance in the semiconductor industry. Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions.
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from Tim Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Thanks a lot. Doug, I wanted to ask about the service system mix in the guidance. So, you said that the service -- I thought you said but you now think it's going to grow modestly this year. But if I flatline service in September and December, it's up 8% year over year.
So, can you just clarify what you're thinking for service in the guidance? Thanks.
 -- 
Yes, Tim, we don't decompose the individual components of the guide. I was clarifying, we now expect CSBG to be up a little bit for the year. It was particularly strong in the June quarter, whether it is up, down, or sideways from that as we go forward. I'm not going to give you individual components of the forecast.
But I do think for the year, it's going to grow a little bit.
 -- 
OK. Great, Doug. Thanks. And then can you talk a little bit about -- just in DRAM, I think there's generally more excitement, Tim, about DRAM WFE than NAND, WFE among most investors out there about where it could go during this next peak.
Obviously, you do very well in NAND. But in DRAM, you did talk about a lot of the investments that you're making. Can you just talk about -- I know your leverage to the advanced packaging part of the HBM dollars being spent but that's still a pretty small piece of it. So, can you just maybe give a chance to kind of distill some of the view that you're not very levered to DRAM and give us a sense of maybe where you're investing and where you think you can gain share in DRAM?
 -- 
Sure. Thanks, Tim. And as you said, we do very well in NAND and we still think NAND Day is coming, as I said. We've seen some of that -- those commentaries around the enterprise SSDs, etc.
But on the DRAM side, the reason we highlighted, the progress we're making, especially in this conductor etch I mean, one, it's a new tool we've introduced. It's new capabilities that are very exciting for the industry and really targeted toward the types of ultra-small structures that are going to exist in future DRAM nodes going forward. Lam is the global leader in conductor etch. And so, we're applying all of that expertise and learning we have toward future DRAM challenges.
And I think there's tremendous opportunity for us on those applications, as I pointed out. The other side of it, a lot of the excitement around DRAM is related to HBM. And there, as you commented, we play extremely well with our strong position in both TSV, etching as well as the TSV electroplating. And I think that we don't see any change in that strong position going forward.
So, we get the benefit both from the scaling and architectural changes that are occurring in DRAM going forward and from the advanced packaging and HBM-related expansion. And all of these -- on both of those sides are multiplied by the fact that you get fewer bits per wafer. And so, everybody recognizes you're going to need a lot more DRAM wafers processed going forward. And ultimately, that translates into more equipment from Lam.
 -- 
Thank you, Tim.
 -- 
Thanks, Tim.
Next question comes from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Hi. Thanks for taking question. My first one is for Doug. I think, Doug, you gave some color on China.
Kind of curious how to think about China into the back half of this calendar year and into calendar '25. And along the same path, you kind of mentioned that December quarter, there could be a slight more gross margin headwind. Is there a way to quantify how much that -- how many basis points of headwind would be in December compared to the 47% in September? And then I have a follow-up for Tim.
 -- 
Yes, sure, Krish. I'll just remind you what we said last quarter. It hasn't really changed in this quarter and what that statement was that for the year, '23-'24, China is up. However, it is a somewhat first-half-weighted year this year as opposed to last year, it was somewhat second-half-weighted.
I'm not communicating, hey, it's going away. It's not going away. It's just the spending because sometimes these customers are a little bit bigger than a bread box, it can be a little bit lumpy and that's very much what we're seeing in China. I'm not ready to tell you exactly what next year looks like from the China region.
But I do think it's going to be a pretty solid year, right? Again, it's not going away. It's too soon for us to quantify things for next year, but '25 should be a pretty decent year in China, Krish.
 -- 
And then, Doug, any color on the December quarter gross margin?
 -- 
I'm not going to give you a number, Krish, but I've been signaling for a while that because of customer mix, margin will have a little bit of some headwind going into the second half of the year. I just guided you to 47% in September and suggested that there might be a little bit of incremental headwind into December because of customer mix is what I said in the script.
 -- 
Got it. Got it. Thank you for that, Doug. And then, Tim, just a quick follow-up.
When I look at all the upcoming tech inflections, like day dollar on, backside power delivery, maybe down the road 3D DRAM. You spoke within that, the transition to 4F2 DRAM from 6F2. I'm kind of curious, is this really that material? And if so, is there a way to size the opportunity for Lam at 4F2, you spoke a little bit about 100 -- just kind of wondering if you can give some more color around how to quantify that number for the 4F2 architecture transition. Thank you.
 -- 
Sure. Well, I don't think we're prepared to quantify it for you today. But I think that my comment was, though, we see each of these inflections. And 6F2 to 4F2 is a technology inflection that brings with it some important changes.
I mean, one, the architectural layout of the device itself puts additional requirements on etch, which I think we're very well suited to serve. And that's why we've been developing new conductor etch capabilities to target those new requirements. So, there is some incremental opportunity there. Clearly, the jump to 3D NAND is a much bigger step-up in etch depth intensity, but our goal is to increase our SAM and grow our share at every technology node.
So, we look at whatever is the new requirement and how we can best address that. You also look -- as you look at DRAM going forward, another thing that's happening, whether it's 6F2 or maybe 4F2 is the implementation of more EUV layers and how Lam plays in EUV. Again, anything where effectively pattern transfer etches. The feature sizes are getting smaller.
Precision is required. These are the kinds of high-tech etches that Lam excels at. And so, we look at participating in those. And then on the deposition side, of course, we've talked about things like our dry EUV resist process and how that plays into EUV as DRAM and Foundry/Logic transition from EUV to high-end EUV.
And so, we're just looking at every technology node as an opportunity for us to gain.
 -- 
Thank you.
 -- 
Thanks, Krish.
Your next question comes from Srinivas Pajjuri with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Thank you. Tim, I have a question on DRAM. Obviously, the recovery has been ongoing and HBM is a secular driver that you talked about, and you do have a very strong position in that market as well. Then I look at your revenue, I think it peaked around December of '23, and it's been kind of declining on a sequential basis.
I'm guessing some of that is maybe mature node DRAM. Just wondering if you're kind of at the bottom and then given all the talk about HBM spending, I would think that it's going to kind of -- it should, at some point, come back strongly. So, I just want to hear your thoughts on why it's been declining. And how should we think about, in particular, in DRAM revenue?
 -- 
Yes. I think you generally have it pretty correct. We had talked about the fact that some mature DRAM spending was a little bit heavily concentrated in the second half of last year through early part of this year even. And as that came off, there was some of a reset in what we would call kind of traditional or the conventional DRAM.
That is being picked up at some rate by the growth in HBM, but HBM is still in its ramping phase. And I think that as we look into 2025 becomes an even bigger driver of wafers in DRAM. And so, I think that explains probably the profile. And I think that as we look forward to the secular driver of HBM, the impact on wafer effectively, how many wafers require us to produce that number of bits due to the dice size and due to the complexity of stacking these DRAMs means that we see DRAM demand for DRAM equipment continuing to grow through 2025 and probably well beyond that.
 -- 
OK. Got it. Thank you. And then on the CSBG business being up 20% sequentially, 22% I know you don't want to give us guidance going forward, at least for the next quarter.
I'm just curious about the sustainability of some of the trends that you're seeing, Tim. And then what does that mean for the overall WFE? Is this a prelude to something? And is this just the utilization improving? And then does this usually follow in terms of WFE increasing and in terms of new tech migrations or capacity additions? So, any color on that would be helpful.
 -- 
Sure. It's a good question. And I guess, again, reminding people that the CSBG business includes our Reliant business, which sells into mature nodes, it includes spares, it includes upgrades, and services. And so, each of those components move somewhat differently.
And we talked about this quarter, particularly being strong as a result of Reliant and spares. We are starting to see a pickup in utilization in the memory fabs as we've talked about -- and I've talked a little bit about the fact that as we look forward, we think that upgrades will begin to become a much more prominent part of our customers' WFE spending as they look to upgrade memory fabs that they really haven't been upgraded in quite some time because of the severe downturn that we've seen in that -- in those markets over the last few years. And so, I do think, going forward, you see a little bit more of a balance between those different segments. Upgrades coming up stronger and spares continuing to grow simply because our installed base itself continues to get bigger.
Traditionally, we would have always said that we would expect the CSBG business to grow every single year, and that's simply effective every year, we ship more tools, and those tools then require services and spares and basically present new opportunities for Lam to capture revenue from those systems. So, I think long-term CSBG will be returning back to that growth and next year, probably much more biased toward the upgrades business as customers start to do memory fab upgrades.
 -- 
Thanks, Tim.
Your next question comes from C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question I was hoping to focus on gross margins.
A couple of quarters ago, Doug, you talked about kind of looking back to the June kind of '23 quarter has normalized. But given the guide today, it sounds like that was conservative and it's a higher number. So, just as you think about calendar '25, as you get to kind of a normalized China mix and you normalize to Reliant, what would be kind of the base level we should be thinking about for gross margins? And then can you talk to what kind of accretion we should be thinking about related to Malaysia and/or some of these higher-margin upgrade drivers?
 -- 
Yes, C.J. I mean, you've alluded to some of the things that move gross margin on, obviously. Yes, I had previously anchored you and other respect to that June quarter before the China mix improved or strengthened, I guess, maybe not improved. As the baseline -- I guided it down a little bit in September, described customer mix softening a little bit relative to moving that.
And I'm not suggesting, hey, a little bit more in December potentially. It's all about customer mix. Too soon for me to guide you for next year, but the things you should be thinking about is what does that customer mix look like next year? I'm not sure yet, and I'm not ready to point you to numbers, but what will begin to show up in a more significant fashion is the accretion for -- from those Asia factories as we ramp output, that will be a benefit to gross margins. So, those are the moving pieces to be thinking about.
The customer mix, I'm not entirely sure but as we see a likely WFE environment next year, that's somewhat stronger, increasingly, the incremental volume will be supported from those Asia factories, which should be beneficial to gross margins, C.J.
 -- 
Very helpful. And then I guess as my follow-up, in your prepared remarks, you spoke to the 7,500 high aspect ratio etch chambers installed in the NAND industry. And just curious, as you see upgrades there, what kind of growth could that add to overall NAND WFE specifically to you guys? Is there a kind of percentage we should think about? Any help there would be great.
 -- 
We haven't quantified that, but the reason I included it was simply to point out the installed base itself becomes a powerful driver of revenue during those upgrade cycles. And we do think that the next phase, we've seen higher memory fab utilization, particularly when we talked about NAND beginning to improve last quarter, and that seems to be continuing as we move through the remainder of this year. We get to next year and the upgrades start in earnest, to those tools represent opportunities for Lam to help our customers achieve both a technology upgrade and a bit cost reduction as they move forward and accrues quite a lot of revenue for Lam relative to the amount of WFE spend. I'll remind people the WFE Lam's capture rate of spending in an upgrade is significantly higher because etch and deposition represents so much of the upgrade.
So, that was the reason we point out the size of our installed base.
 -- 
Thanks so much.
 -- 
Thanks, C.J.
The next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. First, I wanted to ask like if the NAND business next year is primarily driven by upgrades, what does that imply for growth? Like would it be conceivable that NAND WFE could double year over year in calendar '25 that was purely upgrade-driven? Or would you need capacity additions to get there? And are you seeing any signs at all of capacity additions right now? It doesn't sound like it.
 -- 
Well, Stacy, what I would say is that, obviously, we're not going to guide what NAND WFE is next year. Frankly, I think it's still a developing story. But what we're trying to say is that as customers move to upgrades, whatever WFE is spent, Lam will be the primary beneficiary of that WFE spend. And so, that's a year in which my comment was we would be confident that we would outgrow WFE in the NAND space if it was primarily upgrade spend.
And upgrades represent a tremendous efficient way for customers to essentially advance their technology and lower their costs. And so, we do think that will be the next phase of NAND investment based on our thoughts.
 -- 
Got it. Got it. I mean, maybe to follow up on that just a little bit, I mean, if you look at your current like NAND outlook for this year, would you say that that outlook has gotten better or worse or stayed the same versus like 90 days ago?
 -- 
It probably hasn't changed much, Stacy. This is Doug. Maybe a little bit better. We certainly see a little bit of an uptick in utilization.
But I don't think it's meaningfully different, Stacy.
 -- 
Got it. So, it's kind of a noise.
 -- 
Yes, kind of a noise.
 -- 
Got it. OK. That's helpful. Thank you, guys.
Appreciate it.
Next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Given the strength in CSBG, it looks like utilization by your customer base continues to rise.
Did that also broaden out to start to include not just leading-edge logic, foundry, DRAM, and NAND, but maybe also start to include mature and specialty fabs as well? Or are at a minimum, mature and specialty utilization at least stabilizing in line with some of the cyclical improvements that we're seeing in the semi industry?
 -- 
Harlan, mature node stuff is still pretty soft, frankly. And I think you understand what's going on. I think just listen to everybody else's earnings calls in the analog, industrial, automotive space. And there's still a lot of inventory out there, it's still relatively soft.
The statements we're making on utilization have more to do with what we're seeing in the memory fabs, quite frankly.
 -- 
I appreciate that. And then on HBM and advanced packaging, I mean, last night, we heard AMD talk about supply dynamics being tight on their AI GPU supply next year, colos, and HBM on the custom ASIC front, we hear companies like Broadcom keep getting upside orders from their AI customers like Google. Last quarter, you talked about doing $1 billion in advanced packaging and HBM revenues this year. Has that number moved higher and is the team capacity constrained on advanced packaging systems and are your lead times here for those tools starting to stretch out?
 -- 
Well, it has moved higher, and we're not going to requantify it just yet, but it is -- we're seeing very strong demand in those areas. I talked about the expansion of our global manufacturing supply chain footprint. And obviously, that's giving us more flexibility than we had during the last ramp. Our goal through all those investments was to be able to respond in these next few years of expansion better than we did in the expansion that we saw right around the time of COVID.
And so, I think that that will position us. Sure, you're always a little bit short and customers always drop in tools within your lead time, which keeps you busy. But I think that we're doing quite a nice job responding to the urgent request from our customers. We actually like this.
I would say that generally from running the business, we like this environment where all parts of our business are a little bit supply constraint. I mean, you hear a lot of our customers talking about being cautious about adding capacity. Other customers talking about having a little trouble getting tools. I think that's a good place for us to be because it means that I think we're setting up for more manageable long-term ramp of demand than sort of a short spike followed by, again, periods of digestion that always creates a little bit of chaos in the industry.
 -- 
Thank you, Tim. Thanks, Doug.
 -- 
Thanks, Harlan.
Your next question comes from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Doug, if I look at the 2023 year-over-year China sales growth among the big five equipment makers. All of them are up quite well.
ASML is up like 250% and the U.S. peers are up in teens or 20%, but you guys were down 11% total China sales in 2023. And this year, you're expecting China sales to be up. So, I'm just trying to understand the dynamics last year.
Were this just a function of maybe NAND spending and the NAND project not being active or are there competitive elements in China that are working against you?
 -- 
Atif, I'll remind you that perhaps our largest customer got restricted when the regulations came out, our NAND customer in China. That customer was pretty strong in '22, went away in '23. So, the year-over-year comparisons you're making, you've got to factor that in. And then the strength we're seeing '23 to '24 is a different mix entirely, really not any NAND in China to speak of, at least not domestic China.
I don't know if that helps you, but make sure you're thinking about that.
 -- 
Yes, it all makes sense. That's helpful. And then on the cryo improvement, Tim, that you mentioned, are those improvements or process tool of record is going to solidify your market share next year or the year after?
 -- 
That's -- well, I think that all of these things when you introduce something new, I mean, I think what people kind of lose sight of this. Generally, we're working several years ahead with our customers on R&D. I talked about the investments we're making where we make -- we're building labs close to our customers in different geographies. That's because, in many cases, we're engaging those customers a good five years ahead of production implementation.
That's not to say Lam Cryo 3.0 take five years to get into production. But it's not technology that's ramping, say, this year, but it really is looking out at the needs of our customers wanted to generations out and really solving their difficult etch challenges. So, sometimes when the benefits are so good, and I talked about the fact that we get about 2.5 times etch rate, tremendous profile control customers will often pull that in sooner. But really, this is designed for kind of the 400-plus layer may ultimately end up being pulled in earlier than that, but that's where you really start to see the needs for this kind of capability.
 -- 
That's exactly I was asking about. It is 400 layers or 200 layers, but it sounds like 400 layers.
 -- 
Yes. And I think that what we -- you'll see in our press release today, we talked a little bit about we're trying to chart the path across not only etch but also our deposition films toward where the industry needs to go to get to 1,000 layers because we truly see over the next decade, that that's where you want to get in terms of satisfying bit density and cost as NAND demand continues to expand with AI.
 -- 
Great. Thank you.
 -- 
Thank you.
Next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking the questions. I joined late, so I do apologize if these questions have been addressed. Just on the third-generation cryo tool, Tim, that you spoke about.
How is this technology or tool fundamentally different or better than your nearest competitor? I know you just spoke to some of the characteristics, but if you can clarify that for us to the extent you're comfortable, that would be really, really helpful. And then my second question, again, on the CSBG side, probably one for Doug. And again, you may have address this. For the full year, calendar year, I think you previously said flattish, plus or minus.
Is that still the view? Or given the strength you saw in June, is that -- should we be thinking about a higher growth rate for the full year? Thank you.
 -- 
Maybe I'll take that one first, and then I'll let Tim comment on the 3.0 stuff. Yes. You might have missed my scripted statements. As we sit here today, we now expect that for 2024 CSBG, the word I used was modestly grow this year versus last year.
And part of that is we saw particularly strength -- that particular strength in the June quarter in Reliant, a little bit of an improvement in spares. And as we think about the utilization trends that are likely occurring with our memory customers, I think spares continues to be decent and we're optimistic that we'll start to see some of the upgrade spend that we've been talking about for a while. And I'll hand it over to Tim on the 3.0 stuff.
 -- 
Sure, Doug. Yes. I think, obviously, what I would just start with is the biggest difference between what we're delivering with Lam Cryo 3.0 and what our competitors do is in the results on the wafer, which we talked about pretty amazing 10-micron deep holes with less than a 10-nanometer taper from the top to bottom. At etch rates that are 2.5 times conventional etching.
So, it's the results that are pretty amazing. We talked about the fact that the -- this is based on some new surface chemistries that are enabled in our tool and there's a whole combination of hardware issue -- hardware configuration and capabilities in our tool that I think allow us to achieve that result. And I can't go into all of those details today, but it is I did allude to one of them, which is on our Vantex System. The chamber design allows us to deliver a significantly higher ion energy than what is available from any other system available in the semiconductor industry.
And that does play some role in etching these very, very deep near with -- holes with near-perfect verticality. So, that's about all I can say today.
 -- 
Thank you. Appreciate that.
Your next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask you -- I mean, there's been a number of press concerns about export controls with talking about the foreign direct product rule which doesn't seem like it would affect you, but also talking about entity list. And I'm just wondering, obviously, we don't know what would happen with any of that.
But are you seeing any different behavior from your China customers? Are you seeing them push things in or pull things -- push things out because of any of those anxieties?
 -- 
Yes. Joe, I think that, obviously, we don't know exactly what's going to happen either just as you said, and so we can't really speculate on that. I have mentioned in the last couple of calls that there are ongoing discussions all the time with the U.S. government and regulatory agencies were part of those discussions and we'll continue to be.
I think in terms of change in behavior by any of our customers, I don't think it's something that's noticeable nor would it be something that we would be able to easily react to. We've talked about how we deal with some of these new customers that emerge with down payments and other things to make sure that we understand the -- those customers as viable customers. But beyond that, we service them like others at this point as long as we can ship to them. And I would say lead times and responsiveness from our perspective is same as we treat any customers of those size.
 -- 
Very helpful. Thank you.
 -- 
Thanks, Joe.
Next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Hey. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I actually -- I know you got a couple on this, Doug, on the China business. I'm just kind of curious.
I think you qualified as a solid year next year, and I just didn't know what that meant. So, I know you've been hesitant to kind of call of China, I think you called it like flat, plus or minus, maybe up or down last time. Do you feel better about it, I guess, outside of this June that's the other kind of part of the question. Just if you can qualify a little bit.
I mean, you should have some idea of what you're going to ship that pay ahead. So, it was June kind of a cleanup, and it might be a little bit lumpy, and/or is China actually trending a bit better for you?
 -- 
I don't know, Blayne, that I'm trying to communicate anything any different than we said on the last call, to be honest with you. We described this year as somewhat first-half-weighted, really no change to that. The June quarter was maybe a little tiny bit stronger in China, but only a little tiny bit. It's too soon for me to -- for us to quantify 2025.
But what I would tell you is I expect next year to be a solid year in terms of spending in China. I'm not going to give you a number yet because I'm not completely sure. But what I wouldn't want anybody to think is it's going away because it's not.
 -- 
Gotcha. And then I'm just kind of curious, the broad strokes was growth for next year. I know you don't want to give a forecast. But in terms of the moving pieces there, I mean, it's pretty clear leading edge is strong, DRAM has been strong.
I'm just kind of curious as you look into that forecast, if you're willing to venture kind of a view on the NAND business.
 -- 
Yes. I think NAND spending next year has to be greater than it is this year, right? We're off two years of quite low spending in NAND. I don't know what magnitude. I expect next year, we expect next year, you're going to see a lot of upgrades in NAND.
But too soon for us to give you a number, but I would be shocked if it's not stronger than it is this year. It has to be.
 -- 
Thanks, Doug.
 -- 
Yes. Thanks, Blayne.
The next question comes from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Yes. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to try on the NAND side again. If we just think about your prior peak NAND revenue, ex customers that are obviously now restricted, can capacity upgrade to just higher layer counts support your return to those levels, just given your higher share of higher etch and depth intensity for the transitions?
 -- 
Joe, if it's just an upgrade your spending will be lower than when capacity gets added, obviously, our share of wallet will be greater. The fact that we lost a pretty large NAND customer in the China region, hard to replace that. I'm not ready to tell you what kind of next year is relative to previous peaks. But I know next year is going to be a stronger year than it is this year for sure.
 -- 
Yes. And Joe, I think that, obviously, we're talking next year, it's very specific to the demand environment and the upgrade business in 2025. Longer term, I mean, we've laid out, in our view, is that NAND spending rises. And so, it's just a matter of the time frame you're looking at.
And from the standpoint of Lam's business, the etch and depth components and the complexity of tier stacking the precision that's required for implementation of QLC and PLC technologies, all of these skewed toward Lam's technical strengths and also SAM expansion opportunities. I talked about the PECVD, pure carbon gap fill process, which is a new addition to the portfolio for NAND scaling technology going forward. And so, if I go back and I look at where we were in the portfolio, we had to sell, when people used to think of NAND is a very, very strong business for Lam, we've expanded that portfolio quite substantially with the gap fill, the backside stress management, the ALD oxide gap fill process plus the etch and stack debt that we've always had as well as our metallization. So, it's one of growth in NAND demand, but also growth in Lam's portfolio and served market as well opportunities ahead.
So, I think that bodes well for us once the NAND business itself starts to recover.
 -- 
That's helpful color. And just as a quick follow-up, you talked about global mature node spending being roughly flat this year. Can you just help us understand just kind of how does that break down? I mean, I think clearly, the non-China piece is pretty weak. But just any kind of color there you could help us parse that out.
 -- 
Yes. You answered your own question, Joe. China is decent right now. Outside of China, it's pretty soft.
And I think you understand what's going on. There's inventory that's built up, four days inventories still need to come down in the mature node, analog, industrial automotive space, and investment won't meaningfully occur until that gets adjusted. So, that's kind of what's going on. You sort of answered your own question.
 -- 
Fair enough. Thanks.
 -- 
Thanks, Joe.
Next question is a follow-up question from Krish Sankar. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Hi. Thanks for taking my follow-up. Doug, I just had a quick follow-up. It's a question on inventory.
You spoke about bringing inventory turns down. What kind of -- curious like how to think about inventory next year, especially you're planning for a strong WFE year in 2025. Or do you think most of this inventory would be in a bin, how to think about inventory next year? Thank you.
 -- 
Yes. Listen, if you think back to when business declined for us last year, a big part of what fell off pretty rapidly was our NAND business. And so, a lot of the inventory that we still have sitting on the balance sheet will support NAND. So, when assuming NAND is stronger next year, and it will be, we will consume that NAND inventory that's been sitting on the balance sheet for a while.
What will offset that to a certain extent is growth elsewhere, where we'll need to procure new inventory. So, I'm not ready to give you an inventory forecast quite yet, but we're continuing to work as we go through the remainder of this year to kind of bring it down, and then what we do with next year will depend largely on the timing of business, the mix of business, the geographic distribution of business, but we'd like to get turns back to where they historically have been and they're not there yet. So, that's how you should be thinking about it, Krish.
 -- 
Thank you. Very helpful. Thanks, Doug.
 -- 
Thanks.
Next question is from Melissa Weathers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Hi there. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to ask on the leading edge and specifically gate-all-around nodes. I don't think I heard an update to your $1 billion gate-all-around revenues in 2024 target.
So, is that still the case? And then as we think about those nodes ramping through next year, like what's the trajectory of that ramp that we should be thinking about as you move from pilot lines into high-volume manufacturing?
 -- 
Yes. Thanks, Melissa. I mean, we always make choices about what we do and don't include it in the prepared remarks and gate-all-around fell out this time, just no intended message. In fact, if I look at what happened in the quarter, Lam, again, as we've talked on previous calls, is really positioned quite nicely with our forward-looking etch and depth portfolios.
We really targeted those kind of markets with new tools in selected etch, which is a market we hadn't been in before. And in fact, in the quarter, we had additional selected etch wins for gate-all-around at multiple customers. We targeted investment in ALD films that are specifically needed for things like spacers and gate-all-around, and we had additional wins in the quarter for those films. Often with gate-all-around, we think of those -- they are obviously different technologies, but kind of occurring at the same node, the backside power delivery.
That's an area that is really right in our sweet spot in terms of deposition and etch. And in the quarter, we had wins in backside power in ALD oxide. And so, I would say net-net, I mean, given those wins and what you're hearing from the end markets about the need for high-power computing demand for AI, I think the $1 billion forecast we gave you, certainly, as we move through next year would be going higher. And so, again, that's a combination of rising demand, but also a product portfolio that's both expanding and one in which we're winning share.
And so, there was no message about leaving it off, but thank you for asking the question so we could get that in right at the end.
 -- 
OK. Thank you. That's all my questions there.
 -- 
Awesome. Operator, I think that concludes our call. I want to thank everybody for joining us today. We look forward to seeing you at a variety of conferences and interactions as we go through the remainder of the quarter.
Appreciate it.
 -- 
Thank you.

JD, TJX, TPR: Which Retail Stock Is the Strongest Buy? 2024-08-01T04:08:59.000Z

The broader basket of retail stocks may not have been dealt the best hand in the world at the start of this year, with consumers continuing to hurt from inflation, geopolitical turmoil, and macro headwinds. Now that inflation is approaching its target (in the ballpark of 2%), it’s becoming less of a problem.
Still, don’t count on consumers to be any less selective, cost-conscious, and cautious, as the price increases from past years are in the books, so to speak — that is, unless some goods are in for a bit of deflation (think fast food) in the coming quarters. At this juncture, it’s likely best to be optimistic but still somewhat cautious when it comes to the retailers as a whole.
Like in the fast food scene, discounts and a high perception of value could continue to be the key to success in this 
.
Shares of Chinese e-tailer 
. Undoubtedly, the multi-month plunge followed an underwhelming (but in-line) first-quarter showing that saw revenue rise 7% while operating profit fell 5%. The quarter may have been nothing to write home about, but with lower expectations, a depressed valuation, and ambitious expansion efforts, I’m inclined to stay bullish on the stock.
Perhaps the biggest draw to JD stock is the rock-bottom multiple. At 7.8 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E), JD is close to the cheapest it’s been in the past year.
The Chinese economy may be in a historic slump, and, of course, there are geopolitical uncertainties to account for. Either way, patient investors with a high pain tolerance may wish to back JD on the cheap as China attempts to turn a corner while JD looks to pull off a Temu of sorts by expanding internationally.
Unlike Temu, which sells dirt-cheap items at rock-bottom prices, JD tends to sell higher-quality, authentic products at still reasonable prices. When it comes to aggressive discounting, Temu is tough to top. However, JD may find success internationally as it brings goods that offer more on the quality front.
More recently, JD reportedly showed interest in buying British parcel firm Evri, a deal that could help accelerate its European expansion. I think acquiring its way to a solid logistical foundation is a pretty smart way to kick the international expansion into high gear. Whether such efforts to grow beyond China pay off in the medium term, though, remains to be seen.
JD stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 14 Buys and three Holds assigned in the past three months. The 
 of $40.58 implies 53.8% upside potential.
TJX is a discount retailing juggernaut that’s been in an unstoppable rally since bottoming out in the middle of 2022. The company behind TJ Maxx, Homesense, and Marshalls offers a wide range of brand-name merchandise at competitive prices. In the U.S., bargain hunting has kept TJX head and shoulders above most other retailers. And as TJX eyes an international expansion, there are reasons to believe TJX stock’s great bull run has legs. All things considered, I’m staying bullish on the off-price retailer.
In the (latest) first quarter of Fiscal Year 2025, TJX saw net sales grow 6% while comparable store sales crept 3% higher. Clearly, demand for a bargain has remained robust, even as inflation hit the brakes. What’s more remarkable is that the firm seems to have done a good job of maintaining inventory levels. After all, there’s nothing more off-putting than going to the local Winners or TJ Maxx to find a bunch of empty racks and shelves after other shoppers have scooped up the bargains with both hands.
Looking ahead, the firm sees comparable sales rising by 4%. That’s pretty impressive. But what’s even more impressive is the company’s expansion, which will see “at least another 1,300” new stores be opened. Ascending comparable sales and a solid store expansion plan is a formula for surging earnings and, with that, a rising stock.
At 26.8 times forward P/E, TJX stock looks quite rich now compared to the past-year range. However, when you consider the winning formula and continued demand for value, the premium seems more than warranted.
TJX stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 17 Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. The 
 of $116.25 implies 2.7% upside potential.
Tapestry is a firm behind affordable luxury and fashion brands such as Coach and Kate Spade. These brands are a relatively cheap way for some to look and feel rich. The stock has been on an awful run since peaking back in February. Now down more than 17% from 52-week highs, questions linger as to how Tapestry can lift itself off the canvas following a mediocre third quarter that saw sales 
. With a depressed multiple and a potential path higher, I’m staying bullish.
Currently, the stock is trading at 8.1x forward P/E, which puts it at the low end of the past year’s historical range. With new product innovations over at Coach, like the Quilted Tabby, perhaps Tapestry can convince consumers to loosen the purse strings a bit, even as luxury demand (especially affordable luxury) hits a bit of a soft spot.
For now, it looks like Tapestry’s bid to buy Capri 
 is dead in the water. Either way, Tapestry has more than enough dry powder to make deals elsewhere. Maybe now is as good a time as any to pursue other opportunities while the industry is still in a tough spot.
TPR stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with eight Buys and one Hold assigned in the past three months. The 
 of $50.50 implies 26% upside potential.
The following retail plays look quite enticing, according to numerous Wall Street analysts. Whether we’re talking about JD and its international push, TJX and its own expansion, or Tapestry and its fashionable new Coach bags and war chest, each name has overlooked strengths that may yet be factored into the share price. Of the trio, Wall Street sees JD as having the most room to gain (53.9%!) in the year ahead.

 is a hedge fund specializing in long/short equity strategies. Based in New York City's Hudson Yards, its founders and industry veterans, Richard Schimel and Larry Sapanski, aim to redefine the multi-manager model with an evolved approach to portfolio management. The firm provides a multi-manager investment platform to its investors combining fundamental stock picking with proprietary quantitative tools with a focus on scrupulous risk management practices to ensure robust investment strategies. According to Schimel, “Cinctive is the evolution of the experiences Larry and I had over the past two decades.”
Richard Schimel and Lawrence Sapanski founded Cinctive Capital Management in 2019. Since its inception, the hedge fund's assets have nearly quadrupled. Sapanski and Schimel have worked together for 14 years. Back in 2005, Larry also co-founded 
, managing significant assets in financials, energy, bonds, and macro strategies. In the early 2000s, Rich Schimel and Lawrence Sapanski worked for Steve Cohen's SAC Capital Advisors. They founded Diamondback Capital Management in 2005, which managed $5.8 billion in assets. However, the firm closed in 2012 due to client withdrawals following a non-prosecution agreement related to an insider trading investigation. However, the government later dropped the agreement and Diamondback was refunded the $9 million after the conviction was tossed out.
In addition to managing and founding Cinctive Capital Management and the aforementioned ventures, both the Co-Founders and Co-CIOs have held many distinctive roles in the past. Richard Schimel was a Senior Managing Director and Head of Aptigon Capital at Citadel. He also served as Chief Investment Officer at Sterling Ridge Capital Management, which he founded in 2013. Schimel holds a B.A. in Economics from the University of Michigan. Larry Sapanski also brings over 30 years of investment management experience to the Cinctive family. Larry Sapanski paved a similar path for himself like his fellow Richard Schimel before co-founding Cinctive. He started a hedge fund called 
 (2013-2017) where he served as CIO, overseeing trading, risk exposures, and a best ideas portfolio. Larry Sapanski has held various trading roles at London Bishopgates International, Lehman Brothers, Deutsche Bank, and Morgan Stanley. Sapanski graduated from St. John's University with a B.S. in Accounting.
According to the Form ADV filed on March 2024, Cinctive Capital Management disclosed that they are serving 8 clients with discretionary assets under management totaling $3,019,428,000. Their most recent 13F filing for Q4 2023 revealed managed 13F securities amounting to $1,505,809,649, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 17.76%.
Currently, Cinctive Capital Management has been successful in betting on artificial intelligence in energy, technology, and utility sector-related stocks as it ended the first half of the year gaining 11%. Its performance has also been noteworthy while betting in other sectors such as Financials, healthcare, and biotech thereby beating other big multi-strategy hedge funds, such as Citadel and Millennium. The successful track record at Diamondback has allowed Rich Schimel and Lawrence Sapanski to draw noteworthy interest from institutional investors for their venture, Cinctive Capital Management. This achievement comes despite the broader hedge fund industry's increased scrutiny from investors over subpar returns.
Stocks mentioned in this article were picked from the investment portfolio of Cinctive Capital Management at the end of the first quarter of 2024. Schimel and Sapanski's top 5 stock picks returned an average of 11% since the end of the first quarter, vs. 4% gain for the broader indices for large-cap stocks.

Decoding Qualcomm Inc (QCOM): A Strategic SWOT Insight 2024-08-01T05:07:11.000Z

On July 31, 2024, Qualcomm Inc (
) filed its 
 report, revealing a company that continues to thrive in the dynamic and competitive landscape of wireless technology and chip manufacturing. The filing date marks an opportune moment to conduct a SWOT analysis, providing investors with a comprehensive view of the company's financial health and strategic positioning. Qualcomm's financial tables from the recent 10-Q filing indicate a strong financial performance, with total revenues climbing to $9.393 billion in Q3 2024, up from $8.451 billion in the same quarter of the previous year. Net income also saw a significant uptick, rising to $2.129 billion from $1.803 billion. These figures underscore Qualcomm's solid operational execution and its ability to capitalize on the growing demand for advanced wireless technologies and devices.
 Qualcomm Inc (
) stands out as a leader in the development and commercialization of foundational wireless technologies. Its strong brand and extensive patent portfolio, particularly in CDMA and OFDMA technologies, give it a competitive edge in the 3G, 4G, and 5G markets. The company's ability to innovate and drive industry standards has resulted in a dominant position in wireless chip manufacturing, with a broad customer base that includes nearly every premier handset maker.
 The company's financial health is robust, as evidenced by the latest 10-Q filing. Qualcomm's revenue and net income have shown impressive growth, with an 11% increase in quarterly revenues and an 18% rise in net income compared to the previous year. This financial strength is indicative of efficient operations, a strong product mix, and the ability to command premium pricing due to its technological leadership.
 Qualcomm's reliance on a small number of customers and licensees for a significant portion of its revenue poses a risk. The company's performance is heavily dependent on the sales of premium tier handset devices from these entities. Any fluctuations in their sales or shifts in their strategic direction could adversely impact Qualcomm's business outcomes.
 As a fabless semiconductor company, Qualcomm depends on third-party suppliers for the procurement, manufacture, assembly, and testing of its products. This reliance on external partners exposes the company to risks associated with supply chain disruptions, which could affect its ability to deliver products on time and maintain its profit margins.
 Qualcomm has the opportunity to leverage its technological expertise to expand into new and emerging markets beyond mobile handsets, such as automotive, Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing. The company's research and development efforts in these areas could lead to new revenue streams and diversification of its business portfolio.
 The global transition to 5G technology represents a significant opportunity for Qualcomm. As a pioneer in 5G, the company is well-positioned to benefit from the increased demand for 5G-enabled devices and infrastructure, potentially leading to higher licensing revenues and chipset sales.
 Qualcomm's significant business concentration in China, coupled with ongoing U.S./China trade and national security tensions, presents a threat to its operations. Any escalation in these tensions could lead to regulatory challenges, tariffs, or restrictions that may hinder Qualcomm's ability to operate effectively in this key market.
 The wireless technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change and fierce competition. Qualcomm must continuously innovate and adapt to maintain its market position. Failure to keep pace with technological advancements or to respond effectively to competitive pressures could result in decreased demand for its products and a decline in market share.
In conclusion, Qualcomm Inc (
) exhibits a strong competitive position, underpinned by its innovative technology, robust financial performance, and strategic market opportunities. However, the company must navigate challenges such as customer concentration, supply chain dependencies, geopolitical risks, and the fast-paced nature of the tech industry. By leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses, Qualcomm can capitalize on the opportunities presented by 5G and new market segments while mitigating the threats posed by external factors. This SWOT analysis provides investors with a nuanced understanding of Qualcomm's strategic position, informing their investment decisions in the context of the company's potential for sustained growth and profitability.

Meta beats Q2 expectations but warns of 'significant' spending expansion in 2025 2024-07-31T20:15:32.000Z

Facebook and Instagram parent Meta (
) reported its 
 after the bell on Wednesday, beating Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom lines. But the company warned it expects to see "significant" capital expenditures growth in 2025.
"While we do not intend to provide any quantitative guidance for 2025 until the fourth quarter call, we expect infrastructure costs will be a significant driver of expense growth next year as we recognize depreciation and operating costs associated with our expanded infrastructure footprint," CFO Susan Li said in a statement.
AI spending is a key measure for Wall Street as investors anxiously await a return on Big Tech’s investments in the technology. During its prior quarter, Li raised the company’s full-year total expense estimate from between 
.
For the second quarter, Meta saw earnings per share (EPS) of $5.16 on revenue of $39.07 billion. Analysts were expecting EPS of $4.74 on revenue of $38.3 billion, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Meta recorded EPS of $2.98 on revenue of $31.9 billion during the same period last year.
The company’s Family of Apps revenue, which includes revenue from Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, clocked in at $38.72 billion, higher than estimates of $37.7 billion. Meta saw revenue of $31.7 billion in the segment in Q2 last year.
Meta stock climbed more than 4% following the report.
Beyond its advertising revenue, Wall Street is still trying to determine how much longer Meta will need to plow money into AI before it sees some kind of revenue payoff.
Last week, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Meta’s latest open-source large language model (LLM) called Llama 3.1. What’s more, the Facebook founder said the industry should focus on open-source AI rather than closed-source models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT.
Meta’s Reality Labs segment, which includes its mixed reality hardware and software, saw revenue of $353 million in the quarter versus expectations of $376 million. That's better than the company reported in the same quarter last year, but the segment continues to hemorrhage cash.
In Q2, Meta reported that the segment lost some $4.49 billion, slightly below expectations of $4.53 billion. It lost $3.8 billion in Q1. The division has also been plagued by turnover and a lack of clear vision, adding to Reality Labs’ troubles,

Meta’s announcement also comes after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced on Tuesday that he secured a $1.4 billion settlement between the state and Meta over the company’s alleged use of Texans’ biometric data without their permission for its Tag Suggestions feature.

Qualcomm is undergoing 'a natural recovery': Strategist 2024-07-31T21:19:15.000Z

Qualcomm (
) posted third quarter results 
 while also providing an improved outlook. Brian Colello, Morningstar equity strategist, shares his analysis of the report on Market Domination Overtime.
Colello describes this as "a natural recovery for Qualcomm," noting that the situation couldn't have been worse than it was at the end of 2022 and early 2023 for the company. He sees positive developments across all segments, with even the automotive division outperforming expectations. Regarding the PC market recovery, Colello cautions that it's "a multi-year story," but points out that smartphone-related business is already showing signs of improvement.
Colello highlights Qualcomm's expansion into other sectors as electrification continues across various industries. "I think it makes sense for Qualcomm to be taking its smartphone processor expertise and moving into new markets. PC is one, automotive is another," he explains. "We're seeing electrification of the car, more and more processing power in the car, and that is going to be a multi-year, multi-decade trend. So Qualcomm is going to be in that mix."

Meta says India is the largest market for Meta AI usage 2024-08-01T03:12:44.000Z

WhatsApp's massive 500 million users in India have supercharged Meta's AI ambitions.
Meta CFO Susan Li said Wednesday that India is the largest market in terms of Meta AI usage, a notable milestone considering the product launched in India just a few months ago.
Li said during Meta's second-quarter earnings call that people have used Meta AI for billions of queries since its launch.
"We're seeing particularly promising signs on WhatsApp in terms of retention and engagement, which has coincided with India becoming our largest market for Meta AI usage," she noted.
Meta first launched Meta AI, which is present across Instagram, Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp and the web, in 
. The company upgraded the chatbot in April with the new Llama 3 model and 
 in more than a dozen countries.
While Meta started testing 
, it wasn't 
, after India's general elections were completed.
The company has faced cultural challenges in making AI more attuned to the Indian market. In May, TechCrunch reported that 
. In July, several users on X complained that 
. These results were inconsistent, and in the end Meta tweaked its algorithm to create a level playing field for religious jokes.
 Meta AI is now available in 22 countries, including the recent additions of Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Mexico.
Zuckerberg also talked about needing 10 times the computing power to train the next Llama 4 model.
"The amount of computing needed to train Llama 4 will likely be almost 10 times more than what we used to train Llama 3, and future models will continue to grow beyond that," Zuckerberg said during the call.
Apart from AI, Meta saw promising signs for its social networks. The company noted that Threads now has "almost" 200 million users. Meta said last month that 
. Additionally, Zuckerberg mentioned that the company is seeing promising results of Facebook usage among young adults in the U.S.

Watch These Meta Price Levels as Stock Pops on Earnings Beat as AI Spending Pays Off 2024-08-01T02:00:13.000Z

Shares in Facebook Parent Surged More than 7% in Extended Trading on Wednesday
Shares in Meta Platforms (
) jumped more than 7% in extended trading on Wednesday after the social media giant's 
 topped Wall Street’s estimates, giving investors confidence that the company’s significant investment in 
 infrastructure is reaping benefits.
The tech behemoth's stock price has fluctuated significantly after recent quarterly reports. In February, the shares surged more than 20% on Q4 results amid the declaration of the company’s first ever 
, while light second-quarter revenue guidance sparked a drop of over 10% following Q1 earnings in April.
Below, we take a closer look at Meta’s chart and use 
 to identify key levels to watch out for.
Since the stock’s earnings-driven 
 in early February, the price has remained in a 
, fluctuating several times above and below the 50-day moving average (MA), indicating a lack of clear direction.
A move to a new 
 above the rangebound period in July was short lived, with the shares retracing to the lower portion of the range leading into the social media giant’s quarterly results.
Looking ahead, investors should monitor two key levels that the stock could test amid a post-earnings pop.
The first sits around $490, a location on the chart near the 50-day MA where sellers may look to book profits near a 
 that links several minor 
 that have formed throughout the rangebound period. Although after-hours trading indicates an open higher than this level, it’s worth watching if the shares can hold above this area through Thursday’s close.
Follow-through buying could see a retest of $530, where the price would likely encounter significant overhead 
 around the April and July 
, Until the price decisively breaks out above these two peaks, the later which marks the stock’s record high, there’s the ongoing possibility of a 
.
If the Meta shares go on to break out above the trading range, investors can use the 
, sometimes called a measured move, to project a potential price target.
To do this, we calculate the distance between the range’s two trendlines in 
 and add that amount to its top trendline. In this case, we add $110 to $530, which forecasts a price target of $640.
Meta shares rose 7.2% to $508.87 in after-hours trading Wednesday.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call
, 
Hello, and welcome to Teladoc Health's second quarter 2024 earnings call. My name is Lydia, and I'll be your operator today. After the prepared remarks, there'll be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator instructions] I'll now hand you over to Michael Minchak, head of investor relations at Teladoc Health to begin.
Please go ahead.
 -- 
Thank you, and good afternoon. Today, after the market closed, we issued a press release announcing our second quarter 2024 financial results. This press release and the accompanying slide presentation are available in the investor relations section of the teladochealth.com website. On this call to discuss the results are Chuck Divita, chief executive officer; and Mala Murthy, chief financial officer.
During this call, we will also discuss our outlook, and our prepared remarks will be followed by a question-and-answer session. Please note that we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are important in evaluating Teladoc Health's performance. Details on the relationship between these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations thereof can be found in the press release that is posted on our website. Also, please note that certain statements made during this call will be forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Before you buy stock in Teladoc Health, consider this:
The 
 analyst team just identified what they believe are the 
 for investors to buy now… and Teladoc Health wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.
 provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month. The
service has 
 the return of S&P 500 since 2002*.
Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause the actual results for Teladoc Health to differ materially from those expressed or implied on this call. For additional information, please refer to our cautionary statement in our press release and our filings with the SEC, all of which are available on our website. I would now like to turn the call over to Chuck.

Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by saying how excited I am to have joined Teladoc Health and to lead the organization going forward. The company has many strengths to build upon and to drive higher levels of execution and performance. I'll comment on the quarter's results, but also want to share some early perspectives since joining the company in June.
I've had the opportunity to engage with employees across the organization and visit with many customers and stakeholders, including recently attending our annual forum event, which brought together healthcare leaders, virtual care advocates, and innovators. These discussions have further reinforced my optimism about the future. I've been impressed by the depth of talent and resiliency of our employees and the level of commitment to serving our customers, members, and patients. I'm also gratified to see such a strong focus on patient safety, clinical quality, and health equity, as well as an organizational understanding of the importance of more holistically supporting the physical and mental health needs of people.
Not only are these important aspects from a care perspective, but also represent key points of differentiation in the marketplace to build upon. From a technology perspective, we have important capabilities that will be essential to driving the business going forward, including our member-to-provider matching engines, our ability to effectively manage millions of patients and provider interactions, and the investments we've made in the areas of data science and artificial intelligence. Together with other capabilities that we're working toward, this will position us well to meet the evolving needs of our customers and the healthcare system. And it further underscores the need to ensure we're achieving the expected impact of these investments, which is an area I expect us to further strengthen in short order.
We also have scaled business and leading brands that are well-recognized in the marketplace. Over 92 million people in the U.S. have access to one or more of our products today, and we intend to increase our ability to serve additional needs over time. I'm also excited about our success and market potential internationally, including the strong results and momentum that our international teams are delivering.
All of that said, this is a company that is not yet delivering on its fullest potential. Since joining the company seven weeks ago, I've been evaluating, together with the team, all aspects of our business, our strategic direction and priorities, our product offerings in terms of current performance and market potential, the outlook for our business units, and where we can drive improved performance and long-term shareholder value. And we will be acting on opportunities accordingly. From an operating perspective, I see an ability to strengthen execution, streamline the organization, and further raise the bar on performance.
For example, the challenges noted earlier in the year had a real impact on our business at that time but can also continue to influence results after resolution. This is what I mean by raising the bar on performance, and we're working with focus and urgency to ensure that we execute with a higher level of precision going forward. In terms of streamlining the organization, actions are already underway, including making changes to ensure we are organized to best serve our markets, clarifying and reinforcing accountabilities and deliverables, and scrutinizing our cost structure with an eye toward greater cost efficiency as we deliver for both customers and shareholders now and into the future. With respect to cost savings initiatives that we've already shared previously, the company is on target for achieving both 2024 and 2025 commitments, which Mala will comment on further.
Through these and other actions, we intend to strengthen decision making, accelerate the pace of innovation and speed to market, and unlock greater value over time. This has been and continues to be a key area of focus since joining the company and I look forward to providing further updates going forward. I'll turn to our second quarter results and provide some brief comments before handing over to Mala for more detail. In total, we reported consolidated revenues in the second quarter within the company's previous guidance range, along with overall adjusted EBITDA above the range.
Our integrated care business achieved solid business and financial results, including on both a top-line and adjusted EBITDA basis. In the U.S., integrated care members have grown by nearly 3 million people since the beginning of the year, including 600,000 on a sequential quarter basis. International business continued to grow and create further expansion opportunities. I'm also pleased to see additional ways that our teams are working together across our various businesses to create new areas of differentiation for Teladoc Health.
From a commercial perspective, three quarters of our bookings in the second quarter came from cross-selling into our existing book of business, continuing the momentum we've seen over the past several quarters with the remainder coming from new clients. Our chronic care bundled solutions are generating solid interest from new and existing clients, and we remain focused on increasing our product penetration to serve more people. Shifting to BetterHelp, we're proud of the work the team is doing to support the mental health and well-being of people. The business is serving well over 1 million unique individuals on an annual basis and has a net promoter score of over 70.
While it is resonating with consumers who are paying out of pocket for the services today, the operating environment remains challenging, and elevated customer acquisition costs continue to impact both top- and bottom-line results. We see BetterHelp as a business in transition, one with a market leading position, but needing to find additional ways to reach more people who can benefit from the service while also balancing scale, growth and financial performance. Several initiatives are being pursued to positively impact results going forward, ranging from furthering international expansion, pursuing insurance coverage access in the U.S., and continued product enhancements. We'll provide a further update on the actions we're taking to the business and the third quarter call, but also believe it's appropriate at this point to modify our guidance approach as we navigate through these changes and challenges.
Mala will comment more on BetterHelp in a moment. In closing, let me say that we are operating with a strong sense of urgency and have intensified our efforts on both the opportunities ahead of us and in strengthening execution and performance. Through our leadership position in the marketplace, our talented and committed employees, and our value proposition, we expect to deliver for our customers and drive the long-term potential and success of the organization. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mala to review our second quarter results and our outlook.
 -- 
Thank you, Chuck, and good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter consolidated revenue of $642 million decreased 2% year over year. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $89.5 million, which was above the high end of our guidance range and up 24% year over year, representing a margin of 13.9%. Consolidated net loss per share in the second quarter was $4.92 compared to a net loss per share of $0.40 in the second quarter of 2023.
Net loss per share in the second quarter included a noncash goodwill impairment charge of $4.64 per share, amortization of acquired intangibles of $0.38 per share, and stock-based compensation expense of $0.25 per share. The goodwill impairment testing was triggered by the decline in Teladoc Health's share price with the impairment amount impacted by a higher discount rate and lower forecasted cash flows, and particularly the impact of challenges at BetterHelp. Second quarter free cash flow was $60.9 million compared to $64.6 million in the second quarter of 2023. Excluding a nonrecurring, nonincome tax refund in the prior-year quarter, free cash flow was up approximately 25%.
We ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash and equivalents on the balance sheet. Turning to our segment results, integrated care segment revenue increased 5% year over year to $377 million in the second quarter. Chronic care was a key contributor to this year-over-year revenue growth. We ended the quarter with chronic care program enrollment of $1.17 million, up 9% year over year and up 5% sequentially.
The largest drivers of chronic care enrollment growth versus the prior year period were our diabetes prevention and weight management programs, followed by hypertension. As an example of the continued success we are seeing with our land-and-expand strategy, we recently upgraded the fully insured population at a large regional Blues plan from our diabetes management solution to Diabetes Plus, and expanded it to all fully insured members, while also securing a hunting license for our newly launched advanced weight management solution for the self-insured population. In addition to enrollment growth, we also saw a benefit in the quarter from performance-based revenue in our chronic care programs, where we are earning fees for successfully delivering on outcomes. While these types of arrangements currently represent a smaller portion of our business, we believe that our ability to deliver positive results in value-based arrangements will remain an important lever going forward.
International was also an important contributor with strong revenue growth in the quarter, driven by our B2B business, while we are also seeing success in leveraging our hospital and health systems offerings to unlock new public health system opportunities. U.S. integrated care segment membership at the end of the quarter was 92.4 million members, increasing by 8% year over year and up by a by approximately 600,000 members sequentially in line with our guidance range. Average integrated care revenue per U.S.
member of $1.36 decreased by $0.05 versus the prior-year second quarter. This is driven by mix as we have onboarded a significant number of new members within our general medical product. And typically, they contribute less material to our average revenue per member. As we have said, based on our land-and-expand strategy, we see significant runway to cross-sell additional higher revenue products over time, including our chronic care services.
Second quarter integrated care adjusted EBITDA was $64 million, a 69% increase over the second quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 17% was well above our guidance range of 12% to 14% and represented growth of approximately 640 basis points versus the second quarter of 2023. Three factors helped to contribute to the upside versus the guidance range in the quarter. The first was the performance-based revenue in our chronic care programs.
The second factor was adjustments to compensation accruals, in line with current year performance, including lower than expected performance in our BetterHelp business. And the third part is related to timing, as certain marketing and other operating expenses were pushed into the second half of the year. In aggregate, these three factors accounted for over 300 basis points of benefit to year-over-year margin expansion. Turning to the BetterHelp segment, revenue was $265 million in the second quarter, down 9% versus the prior-year period and slightly below our guidance range of down 4% to 8%.
Revenue was down 1.5% versus the first quarter of 2024, as average paid users declined by 1.9% sequentially, with average revenue per user generally stable and churn in the first half of 2024 improving versus the second half of 2023. The decline in revenue and users versus the first quarter was a result of fewer user additions to the platform. We've talked about how a variety of factors influence the revenue yield on advertising spend, including cost of media, the overall health of the consumer, and dynamics within the advertising channels themselves. In the first quarter, we saw challenging customer acquisition costs through early Q1, which caused us to pull back on our advertising dollars in the quarter in keeping with our goals to balance growth and margin.
Although we entered the second quarter with lower paid users, creating headwinds to our top-line performance, we did see signs of advertising costs stabilizing at Q1 levels in the first few weeks. However, we saw a further deterioration from those levels in May, with that trend continuing into June. To help put this in context, we saw a double-digit percentage increase in customer acquisition costs in May versus what we had seen exiting the first quarter. In line with our strategy to constantly optimize for return on advertising spends, we made the decision to pull back during the second quarter to ensure the appropriate level of return for marginal dollar spend.
This led to fewer gross additions and a lower paid user count, which drove the revenue decline in the quarter. We believe higher customer acquisition costs in the U.S. are being driven by several factors. First, we are seeing customer acquisition costs pressure broadly across many of our advertising channels, which suggest some broader macro weakening of the consumer.
Next, BetterHelp growth is dependent on our ability to efficiently deploy marketing dollars to acquire new customers. Our scale makes us the largest advertiser of virtual mental health. And while our spending is diversified across various channels, there is only so much incremental ad spend we can drive in a short period of time without further inflating our customer acquisition costs. At our scale, and at these elevated levels of customer acquisition costs, we are making a conscious decision not to chase inefficient customer acquisition to points below an appropriate return.
So, this balanced approach and focus on driving ROI and margin is going to come at a lower overall rate of top-line growth as long as customer acquisition costs in our key advertising channels remain elevated. As we have noted, BetterHelp is a business in transition. We are undertaking several strategic pivots to address these challenges and expand our addressable market. As Chuck had discussed, we are actively working on bringing the BetterHelp value proposition to the insurance market.
In addition, we are also moving forward with further international expansion beyond our current footprint with a focus on certain non-English speaking markets. Consistent with our prior commentary, we have seen much healthier customer acquisition costs in non-U.S. markets, which is translating to strong international revenue growth at BetterHelp. BetterHelp adjusted EBITDA was $25 million in the second quarter, representing a 26% year-over-year decline.
Adjusted EBITDA margin of 9.6% was just above the midpoint of our guidance range of 9% to 10% and decreased 210 basis points versus the prior-year quarter. As we faced higher than expected customer acquisition costs, we made the deliberate decision to moderate advertising spend in certain channels during the quarter, which allowed us to meet our adjusted EBITDA margin target and was consistent with our focus on managing the business to an appropriate return on ad spend. Now, let me turn to guidance. For integrated care, we continue to expect 2024 revenue growth in the low to mid single digits.
We are narrowing our range for adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, which we now expect to be up 150 to 200 basis points. Our guidance reflects the first half performance, offset by a slower ramp in chronic care Enrollment, primarily related to client driven delays in the launch of certain member populations, which will likely lead to chronic care enrollment being relatively flat on a sequential basis in the third quarter. We are raising the lower end of our U.S. integrated care member guidance range and now expect 92.5 million to 94 million members at year-end.
For the third quarter, we expect integrated care revenue to be down 1% to up 2%, and adjusted EBITDA margin between 14.5% and 16%. U.S. integrated care members are expected to be in the range of 92.5 million to 93.5 million members. We note that the deceleration in year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter is due in part to a tougher comp due to the realization of performance guarantees in the third quarter of 2023, which added approximately 100 basis points of growth and adjusted EBITDA margin in the prior-year period, as well as impacts from lower chronic care enrollment.
For BetterHelp, customer acquisition costs have continued to trend higher over the past few quarters, and there is limited visibility on the near term path, which as we have discussed, could be further affected by the unknown impact of the upcoming presidential election on ad pricing. Based on actions we are taking as we actively manage the business for an appropriate return on ad spend, while at the same time positioning the business and brand for long-term success, this is leading to an atypically wide range of potential outcomes. Therefore, we are choosing to not provide segment revenue or adjusted EBITDA guidance for the third quarter. And we are withdrawing our full year guidance for both metrics in our BetterHelp segment at this time.
We recognize the challenge this presents from a modeling standpoint. Therefore, to provide a baseline, we note that if customer acquisition costs continue at current levels, we would expect second half 2024 revenue to decline in the low double digits. Consistent with our decision to not provide guidance for the BetterHelp segment, we are, therefore, not providing guidance for the consolidated company, revenue, adjusted EBITDA, net loss per share, or free cash flow for the third quarter or full year 2024. We continue to make progress executing against our cost-saving productivity initiatives, and we remain on track to deliver $43 million in cost savings on a GAAP basis for our business in 2024 and a total of $85 million in 2025.
As we look to 2025 and beyond, there are a number of initiatives that will inform our longer term outlook, including the areas mentioned by Chuck. While our focus remains on driving sustainable financial performance and value creation, we are not in a position to provide a longer-term forecast for our segments or an outlook for the full company, including for 2025 at the current time. With that, I will turn the call back to Chuck.
 -- 
Thanks, Mala. The decision to withdraw our long-term guidance comes as I continue to evaluate all aspects of the business, including our strategic priorities, our cost structure, investments in the business, our product offerings, and capital allocation. I look forward to sharing further details on our third quarter earnings call in October. With that, we will open it up for questions.
Operator?
[Operator instructions] Our first question today comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
 -- 
Thanks very much. Good afternoon. Chuck, I'm going to start with a comment that was in the press release, and that was, you know, unlocking greater value across the entire company. As I listened to your comments and Mala's comments around BetterHelp, should I think that BetterHelp is maybe not strategically a component of the company going forward and, potentially, this would be in better hands of somebody else owning this.
If that's not the way you should think about it, what are some of the other things we should be thinking about in that comment of this greater opportunity across the company?
 -- 
Yeah, thank you for the question. I think with respect to BetterHelp, you know, it's important to note that the company has really built a great capability. It's the largest of its kind, serving well over 1 million people, you know, great results with consumers who are paying out of pocket. So, all of that is, you know, terrific.
I think that the operating challenges Mala's touched on and you're well aware of. I think at this point, you know, BetterHelp is an important part of the company. We're primarily focused right now on managing through this transition period, advancing the deliverables that Mala touched on in terms of international expansion, insurance market, other enhancements, and balancing the scale and financial strength of the company and financial performance. With that said, like any business, we're going to continue to evaluate what we're doing, where we're operating in a way that creates long-term shareholder value.
When I'm talking about unlocking value, when you look across our businesses, there's opportunities. And there already are some synergies being realized today, but there are opportunities to do more. You've got a consumer business that has resonated well, and we have need for engagement in our B2B business. We have a scaled B2B business that can benefit from other parts of the organization as well.
So, what I'm looking for is each individual business to meet the market needs and realize its own potential, but as part of the broader company, where are those opportunities to unlock new value and differentiate. I think there's a number of areas that we're going to explore.
Thank you. Our next question is from Stephanie Davis with Barclays. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Chuck, Mala, you both talked of pursuing insurance coverage for BetterHelp in your prepared marks. So, I'd like for you to talk a little bit more about that.
What are the steps that you'll need to take to make an insurance reimbursed product versus your current out-of-pocket construct? How is that going to compare to my strengths? And what are the approximate timelines for taking these steps? Thank you.
 -- 
Yeah, I'll start and then Mala can add to this. You know, from my perspective, this is what I see as the next logical step for BetterHelp. You know, we've got a lot of eyes on the product, but as people work through the process, a significant number, a significant percentage of those consumers that don't choose to move forward cite high out-of-pocket costs, as well as having insurance coverage. So, we want to be able to those consumers, to offer the ability to access their coverage where we can.
In terms of timeline, we're working on deliverables right now to have at least what we call the technical capabilities by year-end to be able to offer that. Obviously, with insurance contracting and so forth, it'll be rolling out over the course of 2025. As you note, there's some additional requirements, additional credentialing, there's other requirements, operational contracting, etc. The way we're approaching that, I think, is a very thoughtful way, where areas where we want to control the experience, which are key to the experience, we're handling those, but we're also leveraging third-party partners for areas that we don't see as core to that experience.
That increases the speed to market, reduces the investments we need to make to bring it live. So, we see that as a manageable upfront investment in terms of building out the capability. But we do see this as a logical progression. But again, I would underscore, it's primarily focused on meeting that consumer need that we have their eyes on the product now, but they want to be able to access their insurance coverage.
 -- 
Yeah, and, Stephanie, what I'd add to what Chuck said is, if you take a step back and think about our efforts for offering insurance, look BetterHelp, mission has always been to make mental healthcare more accessible to everyone. And affordability is the main reason users, as they go through sort of the path to enroll with BetterHelp, don't convert. And it's honestly the No. 1 cause for customer churn.
If you think about the macros that we are dealing with, if you think about, you know, softening consumer spend, inflation, etc., we have an opportunity to actually expand our TAM quite significantly if we were to sort of expand beyond cash pay. So, that's sort of the -- you know, we are being very thoughtful on how we approach this. We are looking thoughtfully into the modalities each step of what we do to implement and execute this with precision, with rigor, and to make sure that from an investment standpoint, we are getting the appropriate return on investments that we will make in this space.
 -- 
Thanks so much.
Our next question comes from Jess Tassan with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
 -- 
Thanks for taking the question, and congrats, Chuck, on starting in the role. I wanted to get maybe your perspective, just having come from a health plan, how would you kind of rank the Teladoc chronic care platform today among competitors in the market? And what are kind of the biggest issues or like low-hanging fruit that you think you can address? And then, a quick follow-up would be, of the people who have access to a Teladoc chronic care solution, how many are actually eligible for enrollment, so have a condition that can be resolved or ameliorated by the chronic care platform? It was easy when Livongo was just diabetes, you know, 12%, but I'm curious what that number is today. Thanks.
 -- 
Yeah, I'll take a stab at it and then Mala can comment further. From a market perspective, you know, from a former customer perspective, I think the company's chronic care products are effective. And we were a purchaser of that in my prior role. I like the way that the company approaches a more comprehensive model as opposed to targeting just a specific situation that they're really being thoughtful in terms of what else that member needs.
As you know, with chronic conditions, a lot of cases, it's more than one condition in play. And like most things with people, it's bigger than just one matter that they are wrestling with. So, I like the comprehensive approach that the company takes and that resonated with me. In terms of where I see our position relative to others, I would highlight that.
I would say that we have more opportunities to create services that can benefit those patients. And I think the journey the company's been on in terms of where it's headed with its weight and obesity management is a good example of that. I think, ultimately, you've got a sophisticated buyer, if you will, out there and they are looking for demonstrated value. They are looking for measurements against that.
I think we've done a nice job with both our chronic care models in terms of ROI and our new cardiometabolic health value model that was validated by Milliman. So, I guess I would say that I think we've got a nice approach. It's resonating in the market. It's comprehensive, and it is demonstrating value.
And the last thing I would say, but, Mala, if you want to add anything, if you look at the impact we're having on the patients that do engage, it's pretty impressive. So, I think we're in a good position there, but obviously more to build upon.
 -- 
Yeah. And to answer your second question, Jess, look, here's the good news, right? We are continuing to see strength in the number of recruitables that we have, right? The recruitables momentum continues. And I would say, you know, that is testament to our product offerings, the fact that we are seeing strength in selling chronic care bundles increasingly. If you think about our overall chronic care bookings, more than half of it was chronic care bundles.
The reason I mention this is, if you think about, you know, your question around, how are we doing in converting those recruitables into chronic care enrollees, we don't give the actual number in terms of enrollment, but it continues to be strong and increase relative to what you quoted as the enrollment numbers in the Livongo days. And the reason for that is, if you think about our ability increasingly to sell chronic care bundles to clients, what happens when you do that is, you know, you will see enrollees essentially enroll into multiple conditions, use multiple off our programs rather than say one diabetes program, etc. And all of that helps from an enrollment perspective.

Thank you.
Our next question comes from Jailendra Singh with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Thank you, and thanks for taking my questions. Given we are in the heart of the selling season, I was wondering if you could speak to what you are seeing in terms of RFP activity in your integrated care segment, employer interest. Last year, I believe, employers were likely caught off guard, primarily because of GLP-1 costs, which likely resulted in sales cycle generally getting elongated. Curious what you guys are seeing this year.
And maybe spend some time on your provider-led weight management program and traction that it's getting, given GLP-1 still remains on top of mind for most employers.
 -- 
Yes. Thank you for the questions. A couple of things. In terms of the selling season, if you will, I think we're feeling really good about that at this point overall.
The sales teams are progressing on both bookings, as well as actively managing pipeline opportunities. And as I mentioned before, I mean I think what we're seeing in the market, generally is good activity. But a sophisticated buyer base that's looking for, again, raising the bar in terms of demonstrated value, they are definitely looking for ways to reduce fragmentation, so I think at least having a more effective experience versus all these point solutions, so that's definitely a trend and theme out there. I think that -- so we're seeing good activity across the board, and we'll continue to go after that.
I think with respect to the weight and obesity management, obviously as you know, that's a significant area of focus, particularly with employers, not just with GLP-1, but just how to manage this issue more holistically. I think there's a range of approaches out there, and I think it's a little early to see kind of how those all play out. I think what we're trying to play is a place where we can create customized options for employers depending on what they are trying to solve. And as you note to, you know, all the way up to our most advanced program which includes physician access, a Teladoc physician, that's trained in obesity management.
So, I think we're seeing a lot of interest there, maybe even perhaps more than we probably thought coming into the year. But it's early in this whole process, and I think what we're trying to do is make sure we're there for the long haul, so that the approach we're taking and the impact we're making is something that's sustainable versus something that's maybe, perhaps, a quick fix.
 -- 
Thanks, Chuck.
Our next question comes from Richard Close with Cannacord Genuity. Your line is open.
 -- 
Yes, thanks for the questions. And good to talk with you Chuck in your first call here. Mala, I was curious on the charge, if you could just go into a little bit of the details on the BetterHelp component of that, just that process. And then my follow-up is on BetterHelp.
If you get insurance coverage, are you thinking about leveraging that into the existing employer book of business, which I would assume would be really low acquisition cost for BetterHelp?
 -- 
Yeah, so let me do it in reverse order, Richard. Thank you for your questions. You know, when Chuck talked earlier to Lisa's questions around where is -- you know, what do we mean in terms of synergies across the business, and Chuck spoke about BetterHelp leveraging the B2B side of the business, what you just said is one of the examples that I would cite in terms of, you know, go-to-market for how we are thinking about BetterHelp with insurance. And what do I mean by that? The fact is, look, if you think about the strength of the client relationships we have, we have talked about our client retention rate being over 90%.
We have long-standing, good relationships with our clients, and this is an opportunity for us to actually use that to your point, in a smart efficient way with the BetterHelp product. Obviously, there are things we need to do to make sure that the BetterHelp platform and product is suitable for the B2B space, and we just talked about that a few minutes ago. So, that's on your second question. On your first question around the charge, look, as I said in the prepared remarks, the impairment charge essentially was the -- for us to take a look at impairment, it's really triggered by the decline in share price.
And then, it's sort of -- as I said, the drivers for the impairment charge really are the discount rate, as well as cash flows. And if you think about the BetterHelp business and the fact that our revenues are lower and our adjusted EBITDA is lower than what we had expected, it's not really a surprise that, you know, we do have to take the impairment. So, those are the factors that really went into us coming to the impairment charge that we did. The last thing I would say is, maybe one of the things that is implied in your question is, how is it sort of on the BetterHelp side? If you think about it from an accounting perspective, when we broke out into segments a couple of years ago, we essentially allocated the goodwill across both the segments based on value, and that is the reason why you are seeing the goodwill charge on the BetterHelp side.
 -- 
OK, thank you.
Our next question is from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Hi, guys. Thanks so much for the question. I was wondering if you could comment on current BetterHelp tax as we are in the third quarter. And if not, I was also wondering if you could talk about the lower member growth that you talked about due to delays in enrollment and integrated care in the second half of the year.
Can you give us a little bit more color on sort of what's causing those delays and what are your updated expectations for when those members come onboard? Thank you.
 -- 
Yeah, so I'll take them in order Elizabeth. In terms of the customer acquisition cost for BetterHelp, the reason we sort of moved away from giving guidance is as we have talked about. As we went through the quarter in Q2, relative to the expectations that we had about customer acquisition costs upon entering the quarter, you know the tax was certainly a lot higher. We've talked about double-digit relative growth relative to the first quarter.
So, the customer acquisition costs were a lot higher. And we are not seeing at this moment a lot of improvement or change relative to that trajectory for all of the reasons that we cited in the prepared remarks, right? We are diversified in terms of channels within the BetterHelp business, but we are the largest advertiser in the space. You know, we are the most scaled business, and for us to drive revenue growth, we would have to deploy incremental ad spend, but it is harder and harder to do that efficiently and more importantly profitably. And as we balance top-line growth with return on ad spend and efficiency, that certainly increasingly becomes a challenge.
So, we continue to see elevated levels of customer acquisition costs. We have limited visibility into how those will play out as we go through the rest of the year. You combine that with softening macros and so we felt the range of outcomes is just too large for us to provide guidance. So, that's sort of on the customer acquisition costs.
On the chronic care enrollees, a couple of points to make. One is, the client -- the launch -- the delays in client launches really are into 2025. And so, we would expect to enroll those members really in next year, not in the back half of this year. The other thing I would just comment, and maybe, Chuck, you want to add more to this in terms of your mindset and philosophy from an execution standpoint, I do think there is an opportunity for us to continue to get better in conversion, in enrollment to execute better and better as we sort of get more data.
Do this for an increasing amount of time, and that is also something that we certainly are taking a very hard look at from an execution perspective. Chuck, I don't know if you'd like to add.
 -- 
Yeah, I think you said it well. I think this is an example of what we mean by raising the bar on performance and execution. And this space is, as an example is, taking an end-to-end look at how we're performing, how do we get the information we need, how do we leverage it, how do we reach out and engage, how do we measure each step of that process so that we are maximizing our potential in terms of the eligibles that are in front of us. So, I think that's something you are going to see from us is just continue to make sure that the processes we have and the operating model is delivering and performing as we expect.
 -- 
Thank you.
Our next question comes from Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Thank you. Can you clarify if the increase in advertising pricing is increasing evenly across all of the channels, or if there are outliers where maybe a mix shift could be beneficial? Then, when you talk about your strategy of not chasing customer acquisitions, does that mean that you are prioritizing holding the ratio of advertising and marketing to revenue flat from the level here? Or should we think about it as more of direction on your total dollar spend on advertising being more flattish? Thank you.
 -- 
Yeah. So, let me address them in turn. The things that I would say on the channels, the various channels, what we saw as we went through the second quarter is the following. We did see heightened costs in our nonauction channel.
So, if you think about podcasts, channels like that, we did see elevation in pricing in those channels to some extent relative to the first quarter, where we did see quite significant increase in our customer acquisition costs was in the auction channel. You know, if you think about the dynamics of how ad spend works across these different channels Sarah, the non-auction channels typically are somewhat gated in terms of capacity. And so, where we really have a lot more flexibility in deploying ad spend is in the auction channel, paid search, etc. So, that is really where we saw quite a significant increase in our customer acquisition costs, but we did see some elevation even in the nonauction channels.
And that's one of the things I cited in my prepared remark, that the elevation in pricing across all of these channels leads us to believe that certainly there is consumer pressure, there are macro softening, because we are seeing that pressure across all of the channels. In terms of how we are essentially managing this business for BetterHelp, I'm not going to speak to adjusted EBITDA for the back half or for the full year, just given the fact that we have withdrawn our guidance, and we've chosen to withdraw our guidance. What I would say is the following. We are -- it's not like we are leaving profitable revenue dollars on the table.
What we are attempting to do and doing is essentially optimized return on ad spend, so that if you think about the returns on the marginal dollar of revenue, it is not unprofitable. So, that is what we mean when we say we are not chasing revenue for revenue sake, we are balancing top-line end revenue with bottom line.
 -- 
Thank you.
The next question today comes from Sean Dodge with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Yeah, thanks. Mala, you mentioned three factors benefiting margins in the quarter. The first one you called out I think was a performance fee you received related to the chronic care business. Can you quantify for us how much that contributed? And then, I think you also mentioned the timing of a shift in ad marketing spend related to what you were just talking about, that was pushed from Q2 into the back half of the year.
I was wondering if you could quantify that for us as well. Thanks.
 -- 
Yeah. So, look, what we have said in the prepared remarks is, you know, we were -- we saw an adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 640 basis points year over year. The three factors that we cited contributed to roughly about 340 basis points in total. So, excluding that, we would have expanded our margins by 300 basis points.
Still very healthy relative to what we generally expect on average. The only thing I would say, Sean, is, off that 340 basis points, the factor of performance based revenues was roughly, call it about half of that or slightly less than half of that. So, about 150 basis points was around performance based revenue.
 -- 
OK, that's helpful. Thank you.
The next question comes from Charles Rhyee with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Yeah, thanks for taking the question. Mala, I know you've mentioned, you are not deciding guidance here on BetterHelp. But just historically, if we think about the cadence that we've seen over the last couple years, you've talked about sort of using ad spend for the second and third quarters, kind of ramping that down in the fourth quarter then to sort of harvest the margin. And so, historically, at least over the last couple years, fourth quarter has been sort of the biggest EBITDA quarter in terms of dollars for BetterHelp.
But given sort of what you're seeing now in terms of CAC, customer acquisition cost, it looks like in 3Q as well, should we still expect sort of that seasonal pattern for EBITDA? Or should we think about EBITDA maybe being a little bit more sequentially flattish in the fourth quarter? Would you expect sort of that historical pattern still to sort of be evident?
 -- 
Yeah, thank you, Charles. Here's what I would say to you. I think that given the fact that we typically historically have pulled back on ad spend in the fourth quarter for an important reason, the holiday pricing season for ad spend tends to be relatively inefficient. And I would say, if you combine that with what may happen, you know, leading up to the elections.
Again, this is -- we have limited visibility into how customer acquisition costs are going to go. But if you look at what has happened in terms of holiday pricing, I would expect that, obviously, to continue this year. And that certainly will have, will weigh in on our decision on how much to spend in the fourth quarter. I would also say, as always, we would balance that with setting ourselves up for 2025 in a reasonable manner from a top-line growth perspective and a user perspective.
So, again, what I'm saying is no different from the different considerations we put into the mix every single year. I would say our thinking would be along the same lines as we go through the year.
Our next question comes from Mike Cherny with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. Maybe if we can go back relative to the removal of the multiyear targets, I understand given all the commentary you've had so far regarding BetterHelp, why you would do that. That being said, is the intention still to run the business as if those were the targets you were pushing for? Or are you using this as a potential pivot point to make any drastic changes? I know someone earlier had asked about the long-term future of BetterHelp. I'm just thinking about, operationally, how you are thinking about running the organization, managing the organization, given this elevated level of uncertainty with what I'm hearing is still a little bit lack of visibility in terms of when it can turn around.
 -- 
Yeah, so, we'll address that in two ways, specific to BetterHelp, and then, you know, what it means. Obviously, BetterHelp is an important contributor to our overall, you know, financial, revenue profit, as well as free cash flow. So, as it relates to BetterHelp, look it's a business in transition. And because we have limited near-term visibility, I think what's important for us to do is to really manage the business in a very disciplined way, to balance top line and bottom line, not chase revenue growth for revenue growth sake.
Really look at optimizing our return on ad spend, while preparing the business to make the strategic pivot that we need to make. Those include the international expansion, which is going well relative to our expectations that we had as we went into the year. We are making progress and going deeper into the English-speaking markets. We are looking into judiciously expanding into some non-English-speaking markets.
So, far, you know, the revenue per user and customer acquisition costs that we are seeing are in line with expectations, in line with what we had gone into this expansion with. So, that's on international. We have talked about BetterHelp with insurance. You know, we are looking at other strategic pivots in this business, and I think it is important for us to balance the shorter term of how we stabilize the, what I call the U.S.
consumer business, the core business, with managing all of these pivots, from a leadership perspective, from a bandwidth perspective of the management team at BetterHelp, as well as from an investment perspective. So, that is, I would say, on the BetterHelp side. I would say more broadly, you know, from an integrated care standpoint, we've reaffirmed our 2024 guidance on revenue. You've talked about bringing down the low end of the adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, still a healthy margin expansion year over year, 150 to 200 basis points.
Under Chuck's leadership, we are, you know, taking a serious look at many different things from a structure and a management perspective of the business. We are clarifying accountability, and that's really going to help us prioritize our investments for growth. So, you know, Chuck has spoken in his remarks on how he's taking a comprehensive look across all aspects of the business. And that's the process that's going to take a little bit of time.
So, we wanted to just give him the ability to go through that, to complete that in a thoughtful way. And, you know, we will come back to you all in terms of what that means, in terms of an updated outlook over the coming months.
Our next question comes from Daniel Grosslight with Citi. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to clarify that the chronic care enrollment delay, that's separate from the technical issue you mentioned last quarter. And then, my real question is on how you are thinking about performance guarantees and really value-based care and population health going forward.
I understand it's a small part of the business right now. But, Chuck, given your experience building out value-based care asset set guide well, I'm curious how you are thinking about leveraging that experience to take a more clinical risk, not necessarily this year but maybe '25, '26, and beyond. Thanks.
 -- 
Yeah, well I'll hit the second part and then Mala can comment. Yeah, I do think back to the customer base and the sophisticated buyers and expecting more and more in terms of performance measurements and outcomes, that aligns well with what we've been doing as a company and what we are and will be building out in terms of a more complete picture to manage patients. So, I think those things are going to converge, where you're going to see, one, our capabilities expand, which are already strong today, but there's additional elements as we move forward, and a convergence with the customer base in the marketplace that is expecting and demanding more value-based measurements and willing to put more of the economics in play, if you will, and allow a company like ours to participate in the value that we are able to create. So, I think both of those are going to be an important part of the future for us and for other organizations like us.
Mala, would you add anything?
 -- 
No, I'll just hit the first part of your question, Daniel. Look, the issues and the challenges that we had at the beginning of the year were really related more to the client mapping, you know, data mapping on our client hierarchy. That is really -- we've solved for that. That's behind us.
What I will say is, and Chuck sort of mentioned this in his prepared remarks, I do think that as we move forward, it is important that we don't have execution methods like that, because it does certainly mean that we have to get over the challenges that create from a results perspective, relative to the plans that we have. And so, you know, as we are beginning to work with Chuck, we are certainly spending time as a leadership team looking at our internal structures, our governments, etc. That is really going to prevent us from having those kinds of methods.
 -- 
Got it. Thank you.
Thank you. We're now out of time for any further questions so this concludes the Q&A session, as well as the conference call. Thank you everyone for joining. [Operator signoff]

Mark Zuckerberg sees a WhatsApp boom in the U.S. as a game changer 2024-08-01T03:29:47.000Z

WhatsApp is the most popular messaging app in the world with
 around the globe, but it’s never quite caught on with American audiences.
CEO Mark Zuckerberg, whose 
 bought the app for $19 billion in 2014, really wants to reverse that trend, he said
 on Wednesday. And if more U.S. users convert to WhatsApp, it could mean a sea change for the
, said Zuckerberg. Meta previously announced that the app had crossed a milestone of 100 million monthly active users in the U.S.
“The WhatsApp stat, I think, is really important as a business trend, just because the United States punches above its weight in terms of—it's such a large percent of our revenue,” said Zuckerberg during the call. “All of the work that we're doing to grow the business opportunity… over time is just going to have a big tailwind if the U.S. ends up being a big market so that's one reason why it's really relevant.”
A breakdown of Meta's 
 shows that the U.S. and Canada represented 38% of its total $39 billion in revenues this quarter, while revenues from Asia, Europe and the rest of the world accounted for the rest.
WhatsApp is part of Meta’s “family of apps,” which includes flagship social networking platform Facebook, Instagram, Facebook messenger, and Threads. Revenue for that segment was $38.7 billion in the quarter, up 22%. Meta reported net profits of $13.5 billion this quarter, notching a more than 70% rise over the same period last year.
As for WhatsApp, Zuckerberg said that as the app has begun to make inroads with U.S. users, people have begun to realize, “Hey, this is a really good experience,” he said, which could kick off as more people try out group-chat functions and cross-platform communication.
“It's obviously also personally somewhat gratifying to see all the people around us starting to use WhatsApp,” said Zuckerberg. “So that's pretty fun, but maybe less relevant from a business perspective.”
Still, the bloom has come off the rose in recent years for Meta and WhatsApp. U.S. antitrust regulator the Federal Trade Commission

 -- 
Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. In the June quarter, Lam delivered another set of solid results with revenues, profitability, and earnings per share, all coming in above the midpoint of our guidance. Our CSBG business posted strong growth with revenues up 22% sequentially, led by Reliant and spares. On the manufacturing side, we achieved a key milestone in the quarter with our Malaysia factory shipping its 5,000th chamber.
This is the fastest ramp of a new manufacturing facility in Lam's history, and we remain on track to achieve our long-term cost reduction goals through an expanded global manufacturing and supply chain footprint. As previously communicated, 2024 is a year of strategic investment for Lam, where we are prioritizing product development for key technology inflections, global R&D infrastructure close to our customers, and digital transformation for operational efficiency at scale. We believe these investments will put Lam in a position to outperform as the industry moves into a period of multi-year WFE spending expansion. Now, turning to WFE, we expect this year's spending to be in the mid $90 billion range.
Our customer investment profile is generally unchanged from our prior view, apart from slightly stronger domestic China spending and additional demand related to the ramp of high-bandwidth memory or HBM capacity. We see Foundry/Logic, DRAM, and NAND investments all up on a year-on-year basis. Global spending on mature node technologies is expected to be roughly flat year on year. Looking ahead to 2025, we see a positive environment for continued growth in WFE spending.
The power of AI is a transformative business tool is still yet to be fully realized. Today, the focus on AI model training is driving strong demand for GPUs and HBM. However, as AI use cases expand, we believe inferencing at the edge will spur content growth of low-power DRAM and NAND storage in enterprise PCs and smartphones. Investments for AI-enabled edge devices play particularly well to Lam's strengths.
We anticipate that memory customers looking to scale capacity and lower bid cost will bias WFE spending toward technology upgrades of the installed base. For NAND, the etch and deposition intensity of upgrades is significantly higher than in a greenfield investment. When you consider Lam's sizable installed base in memory, including roughly 7,500 high aspect ratio dielectric etch chambers for NAND alone, we are positioned to outgrow overall WFE when customers upgrade existing memory production lines to next-generation nodes. Longer term, etch and deposition are set to play an increasingly vital role in the industry's efforts to develop faster, more power-efficient, and lower-cost semiconductors to serve AI-related applications by delivering critical solutions for atomic-level device scaling, new materials innovation, and advanced packaging integration, we see tremendous opportunity for Lam to expand our served market and increase our share at each successive process technology node.
To this end, our R&D focus is yielding exciting new products, including this year, our first direct power coupled conductor etch tool with matchless power source and bias, known as Direct Drive. This new power source uses solid-state drivers to stabilize the plasma in the etch chamber 500 times faster than current industry standards. By combining direct power coupling with Lam's unique plasma pulsing capabilities, our latest conductor etch systems are delivering best-in-class performance for newly emerging 4F2 DRAM applications. In 4F2 devices, the nature of the bit line placement requires precise etching of ultra-small high aspect ratio of silicon structures to avoid device shorts or leakage.
With direct power coupling and plasma pulsing, Lam connects to vertically oriented 4F2 transistor architectures with unprecedented depth uniformity and profile controller. Similarly, conductor etch is becoming a critical enabler for EUV patterning for gate-all-around and DRAM due to the need to reduce etch placement error. For nodes below two nanometers, the requirement is for roughly 40% tighter control than at five nanometers. Our new conductor etch tool delivers a 30% reduction in feature roughness, which is one of the main contributors to etch placement error.
In addition, we can achieve one to two orders of magnitude improvement in defectivity for a given EUV dose, further helping customers reduce the overall cost and improve the capability of the EUV patterning process. Turning to NAND. AI applications are driving demand for faster, higher-capacity enterprise SSDs. NAND makers are pursuing both vertical and lateral scaling of NAND arrays as well as increasing bits stored per sell through implementation of QLC and PLC technologies.
In support of these efforts, Lam is developing new dielectric etch and deposition capabilities. Earlier today, we announced Lam Cryo 3.0, Lam's third generation of cryogenic etch technology. Building on our learning from nearly 1,000 cryogenic etch chambers, running in NAND fabs worldwide. This new patented cryogenic etch process delivers industry-leading control of the NAND memory channel hole profile.
When Lam Cryo 3.0 is deployed on our Vantex system, the etch are delivering the industry's highest available ion energy, we can create a 10-micron deep channel hole that has a top-to-bottom profile deviation of less than 10 nanometers or less than 0.1% relative to its depth. Such tight profile control allows customers to increase bit density by packing more cells per layer while also having the flexibility to add more layers per tier. Lam Cryo 3.0 also addresses our industry's need for more sustainable solutions, delivering a 40% reduction in energy consumption per wafer and a 90% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions per wafer compared to non-cryogenic etchers. Deposition technology is also advancing quickly to support increased bit density and lower cost through multi-tier stacking.
Polysilicon and tungsten gap-fill materials have typically been used to enable tier stacking in high-layer-count NAND. Integration of these materials, however, has resulted in poor control of critical dimensions and overlay, negatively impacting yield and performance. Ram's innovative PECVD-based pure carbon and gap-fill process provides an attractive alternative material. With the unique combination of high etch selectivity, superior mechanical properties, and simplified dry post-process removability, it also reduces the number of process steps required in some cases by approximately 50% compared to traditional approaches.
Overall, etch and deposition are becoming increasingly critical to addressing the complex semiconductor requirements of a growing AI environment. We are excited by the breadth of opportunities we see ahead for the company, especially those created by technology inflections to gate-all-around backside power delivery, advanced packaging, and dry EUV resist processing. All of these are etch and deposition intensive and each represents a $1 billion or higher growth opportunity for Lam. We look forward to sharing our progress on these fronts as well as our long-term financial model at our next Investor Day, which we are planning to hold in February 2025.
With that, I'll turn it over to Doug.
 -- 
Great. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. We executed well in the June 2024 quarter.
Our June quarter results came in above the midpoint or exceeded our guidance ranges for all financial metrics. We were pleased with the company's strong execution. For fiscal year 2024, we achieved the highest gross margin percentage since the merging of Lam with Novellus in 2013, coming in at 48.2% and we generated quite strong free cash flow of approximately $4.3 billion or 29% of revenue. Let's look at the details of our June quarter results.
Revenue came in at $3.87 billion, which was an increase from the prior quarter and over the midpoint of guidance. Our deferred revenue balance at the end of the quarter was -- or excuse me, $1.55 billion, which is a decrease of $194 million in the March quarter related to revenue recognized that was tied to customer advanced payments. As we sit here today, I believe deferred revenue remains stable at these levels for the foreseeable future. Let's turn to the revenue segment details.
June quarter systems revenue in memory was 36%, which was a decrease from the prior quarter level of 44%. The decline in the memory segment was mainly attributable to DRAM. DRAM came in at 19% of systems revenue compared with 23% in the March quarter as investments in mature nodes declined in the June quarter. DRAM revenue reached a new record in fiscal year 2024 with spending focused on DDR5 and HBM enablement as well as on the 1Y node.
Nonvolatile memory came in at 17% of our systems revenue, which was down from the March quarter level of 21%. And just a reminder, we are characterizing one customer's investment in specialty DRAM as a nonvolatile investment since it has a nonvolatile component in the device. NAND revenue was at a low point for this year, and I expect NAND investment to gradually improve as utilization rates return to more normal levels and our customers slowly increased spending in conversions to 2xx and 3xx layer devices into the next year. The Foundry segment represented 43% of our systems revenue, which was roughly flat with the percentage concentration in the March quarter of 44%.
Growth in shipments for gate-all-around nodes was offset by a decline in mature node spending. The Logic and other segment were 21% of system revenue in the June quarter, up from the prior level of 12%. The increase was driven by strength in mature node spending in China. With respect to the regional composition of our total revenue, the China region came in at 39%, down slightly from the prior quarter level of 42% and a little bit higher than our expectations from the previous earnings call.
This was driven by domestic China spending. The next largest geographic concentration was Korea at 18% of revenue in the June quarter, versus 24% in the March quarter. Taiwan was 15% of revenue in the June quarter, which was an increase from 9% in the March quarter. The customer support business group revenue in the June quarter pulled approximately $1.7 billion, an increase of 22% from the prior quarter level and 14% higher than the June quarter and calendar 2023.
CSBG revenue represented 44% of our June quarter revenues and reached the highest point since the end of calendar 2022, driven primarily by an increase in Reliant Systems, followed by growth in spares. Our Reliant Systems revenue benefited from strength in domestic China spending for specialty and mature nodes. Spares revenue increased largely due to continued improvement in utilization at our memory customers as well as a little bit of inventory stocking. I do not think CSBG will grow modestly in calendar year 2024.
Let's look at profitability. Our June quarter gross margin came in at 48.5% at the top end of our guided range and slightly down from 48.7% in the March quarter. June quarter gross margin benefited from continued improvement in factory efficiencies, which largely offset the headwind we saw in customer mix that we talked about on the last earnings call. Operating expenses for the June quarter were $689 million, down marginally from the prior-quarter amount of $698 million.
As Tim mentioned, we continue to prioritize spending in research and development to extend our technology differentiation as well as expand our product portfolio. I'd just point out that more than 70% of our total operating expenses were concentrated in research and development. The June quarter operating margin was 30.7%, above the guidance range mainly because of that strong gross margin performance. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 11.5%.
We estimate the tax rate for the remainder of the calendar year 2024 to be in the low to mid-teens level, and this rate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Other income and expense for the June quarter was approximately $19 million in income compared with $10 million in income in the March quarter. The increase in OI&E was primarily the result of fluctuations in the fair value of our venture investments. And as we've talked about in the past, you will see variability in OI&E quarter to quarter.
Let's look at the capital return. We allocated approximately $382 million to share repurchases, and we paid $261 million in dividends in the June quarter. During the quarter, we announced that our board of directors approved a $10 billion share repurchase authorization. We have $10.8 billion remaining in the plan at the end of the June quarter.
For fiscal year 2024, we returned $3.7 billion or 88% of free cash flow, which was in line with our long-term capital plans of returning 75% to 100% of free cash flow. June quarter diluted earnings per share were $8.14, close to the high end of our guidance range. The diluted share count was 131 million shares on track with our expectations and down from the March quarter. Let's look at the balance sheet.
Cash and cash equivalents totaled $5.9 billion at the end of the June quarter, up a little bit from $5.7 billion at the end of the March quarter. Days sales outstanding were 59 days in the June quarter, a slight increase from 57 days in the March quarter. June quarter inventory turns of 1.9x compared with 1.8x in the prior quarter. We are making progress in bringing inventory levels down, and we'll continue to work on this throughout the rest of calendar year 2024.
Our noncash expenses for the June quarter included approximately $79 million for equity compensation, $74 million in depreciation, and $14 million in amortization. Capital expenditures were $101 million, flat with the March quarter level was spending mainly centered on lab investments in the United States and Asia as well as manufacturing facilities in Asia, supporting our global strategy to be close to our customers' development and manufacturing locations. We ended the June quarter with approximately 17,200 regular full-time employees, which was flat with the prior quarter. Let's turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the September 2024 quarter.
We're expecting revenue of $4.05 billion, plus or minus $300 million. Gross margin of 47%, plus or minus one percentage point. This gross margin decline is reflective primarily of an unfavorable quarter-to-quarter change in customer mix. I expect this change to continue to be a slight incremental headwind in the December quarter.
Operating margins of 29.5%, plus or minus one percentage point. Gross margin and operating margin included impact from ongoing transformation costs related to projects to improve our systems and operations. As we communicated at the beginning of the year, we're focused on reengineering our business processes and systems to drive operational efficiencies and to implement AI at greater scale. And finally, we're forecasting earnings per share of $8 plus or minus $0.75 based on a share count of approximately 131 million shares.
Let me wrap up. As we finish the first half of calendar year 2024, I was pleased that we were able to execute to the objectives we shared at the beginning of the year. We prioritize investment to extend our technology differentiation while driving operational improvements. We're encouraged that the spares business recovery is beginning, and upgrade activity should improve as we exit the calendar year.
Longer term, Lam is well-positioned to capitalize the increase in etch and deposition intensity by delivering new capabilities and multiple new manufacturing inflections that we see ahead. We look forward to talking to you in February at our planned Investor Day about the long-term opportunities for Lam to continue our outperformance in the semiconductor industry. Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions.
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from Tim Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Thanks a lot. Doug, I wanted to ask about the service system mix in the guidance. So, you said that the service -- I thought you said but you now think it's going to grow modestly this year. But if I flatline service in September and December, it's up 8% year over year.
So, can you just clarify what you're thinking for service in the guidance? Thanks.
 -- 
Yes, Tim, we don't decompose the individual components of the guide. I was clarifying, we now expect CSBG to be up a little bit for the year. It was particularly strong in the June quarter, whether it is up, down, or sideways from that as we go forward. I'm not going to give you individual components of the forecast.
But I do think for the year, it's going to grow a little bit.
 -- 
OK. Great, Doug. Thanks. And then can you talk a little bit about -- just in DRAM, I think there's generally more excitement, Tim, about DRAM WFE than NAND, WFE among most investors out there about where it could go during this next peak.
Obviously, you do very well in NAND. But in DRAM, you did talk about a lot of the investments that you're making. Can you just talk about -- I know your leverage to the advanced packaging part of the HBM dollars being spent but that's still a pretty small piece of it. So, can you just maybe give a chance to kind of distill some of the view that you're not very levered to DRAM and give us a sense of maybe where you're investing and where you think you can gain share in DRAM?
 -- 
Sure. Thanks, Tim. And as you said, we do very well in NAND and we still think NAND Day is coming, as I said. We've seen some of that -- those commentaries around the enterprise SSDs, etc.
But on the DRAM side, the reason we highlighted, the progress we're making, especially in this conductor etch I mean, one, it's a new tool we've introduced. It's new capabilities that are very exciting for the industry and really targeted toward the types of ultra-small structures that are going to exist in future DRAM nodes going forward. Lam is the global leader in conductor etch. And so, we're applying all of that expertise and learning we have toward future DRAM challenges.
And I think there's tremendous opportunity for us on those applications, as I pointed out. The other side of it, a lot of the excitement around DRAM is related to HBM. And there, as you commented, we play extremely well with our strong position in both TSV, etching as well as the TSV electroplating. And I think that we don't see any change in that strong position going forward.
So, we get the benefit both from the scaling and architectural changes that are occurring in DRAM going forward and from the advanced packaging and HBM-related expansion. And all of these -- on both of those sides are multiplied by the fact that you get fewer bits per wafer. And so, everybody recognizes you're going to need a lot more DRAM wafers processed going forward. And ultimately, that translates into more equipment from Lam.
 -- 
Thank you, Tim.
 -- 
Thanks, Tim.
Next question comes from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Hi. Thanks for taking question. My first one is for Doug. I think, Doug, you gave some color on China.
Kind of curious how to think about China into the back half of this calendar year and into calendar '25. And along the same path, you kind of mentioned that December quarter, there could be a slight more gross margin headwind. Is there a way to quantify how much that -- how many basis points of headwind would be in December compared to the 47% in September? And then I have a follow-up for Tim.
 -- 
Yes, sure, Krish. I'll just remind you what we said last quarter. It hasn't really changed in this quarter and what that statement was that for the year, '23-'24, China is up. However, it is a somewhat first-half-weighted year this year as opposed to last year, it was somewhat second-half-weighted.
I'm not communicating, hey, it's going away. It's not going away. It's just the spending because sometimes these customers are a little bit bigger than a bread box, it can be a little bit lumpy and that's very much what we're seeing in China. I'm not ready to tell you exactly what next year looks like from the China region.
But I do think it's going to be a pretty solid year, right? Again, it's not going away. It's too soon for us to quantify things for next year, but '25 should be a pretty decent year in China, Krish.
 -- 
And then, Doug, any color on the December quarter gross margin?
 -- 
I'm not going to give you a number, Krish, but I've been signaling for a while that because of customer mix, margin will have a little bit of some headwind going into the second half of the year. I just guided you to 47% in September and suggested that there might be a little bit of incremental headwind into December because of customer mix is what I said in the script.
 -- 
Got it. Got it. Thank you for that, Doug. And then, Tim, just a quick follow-up.
When I look at all the upcoming tech inflections, like day dollar on, backside power delivery, maybe down the road 3D DRAM. You spoke within that, the transition to 4F2 DRAM from 6F2. I'm kind of curious, is this really that material? And if so, is there a way to size the opportunity for Lam at 4F2, you spoke a little bit about 100 -- just kind of wondering if you can give some more color around how to quantify that number for the 4F2 architecture transition. Thank you.
 -- 
Sure. Well, I don't think we're prepared to quantify it for you today. But I think that my comment was, though, we see each of these inflections. And 6F2 to 4F2 is a technology inflection that brings with it some important changes.
I mean, one, the architectural layout of the device itself puts additional requirements on etch, which I think we're very well suited to serve. And that's why we've been developing new conductor etch capabilities to target those new requirements. So, there is some incremental opportunity there. Clearly, the jump to 3D NAND is a much bigger step-up in etch depth intensity, but our goal is to increase our SAM and grow our share at every technology node.
So, we look at whatever is the new requirement and how we can best address that. You also look -- as you look at DRAM going forward, another thing that's happening, whether it's 6F2 or maybe 4F2 is the implementation of more EUV layers and how Lam plays in EUV. Again, anything where effectively pattern transfer etches. The feature sizes are getting smaller.
Precision is required. These are the kinds of high-tech etches that Lam excels at. And so, we look at participating in those. And then on the deposition side, of course, we've talked about things like our dry EUV resist process and how that plays into EUV as DRAM and Foundry/Logic transition from EUV to high-end EUV.
And so, we're just looking at every technology node as an opportunity for us to gain.
 -- 
Thank you.
 -- 
Thanks, Krish.
Your next question comes from Srinivas Pajjuri with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Thank you. Tim, I have a question on DRAM. Obviously, the recovery has been ongoing and HBM is a secular driver that you talked about, and you do have a very strong position in that market as well. Then I look at your revenue, I think it peaked around December of '23, and it's been kind of declining on a sequential basis.
I'm guessing some of that is maybe mature node DRAM. Just wondering if you're kind of at the bottom and then given all the talk about HBM spending, I would think that it's going to kind of -- it should, at some point, come back strongly. So, I just want to hear your thoughts on why it's been declining. And how should we think about, in particular, in DRAM revenue?
 -- 
Yes. I think you generally have it pretty correct. We had talked about the fact that some mature DRAM spending was a little bit heavily concentrated in the second half of last year through early part of this year even. And as that came off, there was some of a reset in what we would call kind of traditional or the conventional DRAM.
That is being picked up at some rate by the growth in HBM, but HBM is still in its ramping phase. And I think that as we look into 2025 becomes an even bigger driver of wafers in DRAM. And so, I think that explains probably the profile. And I think that as we look forward to the secular driver of HBM, the impact on wafer effectively, how many wafers require us to produce that number of bits due to the dice size and due to the complexity of stacking these DRAMs means that we see DRAM demand for DRAM equipment continuing to grow through 2025 and probably well beyond that.
 -- 
OK. Got it. Thank you. And then on the CSBG business being up 20% sequentially, 22% I know you don't want to give us guidance going forward, at least for the next quarter.
I'm just curious about the sustainability of some of the trends that you're seeing, Tim. And then what does that mean for the overall WFE? Is this a prelude to something? And is this just the utilization improving? And then does this usually follow in terms of WFE increasing and in terms of new tech migrations or capacity additions? So, any color on that would be helpful.
 -- 
Sure. It's a good question. And I guess, again, reminding people that the CSBG business includes our Reliant business, which sells into mature nodes, it includes spares, it includes upgrades, and services. And so, each of those components move somewhat differently.
And we talked about this quarter, particularly being strong as a result of Reliant and spares. We are starting to see a pickup in utilization in the memory fabs as we've talked about -- and I've talked a little bit about the fact that as we look forward, we think that upgrades will begin to become a much more prominent part of our customers' WFE spending as they look to upgrade memory fabs that they really haven't been upgraded in quite some time because of the severe downturn that we've seen in that -- in those markets over the last few years. And so, I do think, going forward, you see a little bit more of a balance between those different segments. Upgrades coming up stronger and spares continuing to grow simply because our installed base itself continues to get bigger.
Traditionally, we would have always said that we would expect the CSBG business to grow every single year, and that's simply effective every year, we ship more tools, and those tools then require services and spares and basically present new opportunities for Lam to capture revenue from those systems. So, I think long-term CSBG will be returning back to that growth and next year, probably much more biased toward the upgrades business as customers start to do memory fab upgrades.
 -- 
Thanks, Tim.
Your next question comes from C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question I was hoping to focus on gross margins.
A couple of quarters ago, Doug, you talked about kind of looking back to the June kind of '23 quarter has normalized. But given the guide today, it sounds like that was conservative and it's a higher number. So, just as you think about calendar '25, as you get to kind of a normalized China mix and you normalize to Reliant, what would be kind of the base level we should be thinking about for gross margins? And then can you talk to what kind of accretion we should be thinking about related to Malaysia and/or some of these higher-margin upgrade drivers?
 -- 
Yes, C.J. I mean, you've alluded to some of the things that move gross margin on, obviously. Yes, I had previously anchored you and other respect to that June quarter before the China mix improved or strengthened, I guess, maybe not improved. As the baseline -- I guided it down a little bit in September, described customer mix softening a little bit relative to moving that.
And I'm not suggesting, hey, a little bit more in December potentially. It's all about customer mix. Too soon for me to guide you for next year, but the things you should be thinking about is what does that customer mix look like next year? I'm not sure yet, and I'm not ready to point you to numbers, but what will begin to show up in a more significant fashion is the accretion for -- from those Asia factories as we ramp output, that will be a benefit to gross margins. So, those are the moving pieces to be thinking about.
The customer mix, I'm not entirely sure but as we see a likely WFE environment next year, that's somewhat stronger, increasingly, the incremental volume will be supported from those Asia factories, which should be beneficial to gross margins, C.J.
 -- 
Very helpful. And then I guess as my follow-up, in your prepared remarks, you spoke to the 7,500 high aspect ratio etch chambers installed in the NAND industry. And just curious, as you see upgrades there, what kind of growth could that add to overall NAND WFE specifically to you guys? Is there a kind of percentage we should think about? Any help there would be great.
 -- 
We haven't quantified that, but the reason I included it was simply to point out the installed base itself becomes a powerful driver of revenue during those upgrade cycles. And we do think that the next phase, we've seen higher memory fab utilization, particularly when we talked about NAND beginning to improve last quarter, and that seems to be continuing as we move through the remainder of this year. We get to next year and the upgrades start in earnest, to those tools represent opportunities for Lam to help our customers achieve both a technology upgrade and a bit cost reduction as they move forward and accrues quite a lot of revenue for Lam relative to the amount of WFE spend. I'll remind people the WFE Lam's capture rate of spending in an upgrade is significantly higher because etch and deposition represents so much of the upgrade.
So, that was the reason we point out the size of our installed base.
 -- 
Thanks so much.
 -- 
Thanks, C.J.
The next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. First, I wanted to ask like if the NAND business next year is primarily driven by upgrades, what does that imply for growth? Like would it be conceivable that NAND WFE could double year over year in calendar '25 that was purely upgrade-driven? Or would you need capacity additions to get there? And are you seeing any signs at all of capacity additions right now? It doesn't sound like it.
 -- 
Well, Stacy, what I would say is that, obviously, we're not going to guide what NAND WFE is next year. Frankly, I think it's still a developing story. But what we're trying to say is that as customers move to upgrades, whatever WFE is spent, Lam will be the primary beneficiary of that WFE spend. And so, that's a year in which my comment was we would be confident that we would outgrow WFE in the NAND space if it was primarily upgrade spend.
And upgrades represent a tremendous efficient way for customers to essentially advance their technology and lower their costs. And so, we do think that will be the next phase of NAND investment based on our thoughts.
 -- 
Got it. Got it. I mean, maybe to follow up on that just a little bit, I mean, if you look at your current like NAND outlook for this year, would you say that that outlook has gotten better or worse or stayed the same versus like 90 days ago?
 -- 
It probably hasn't changed much, Stacy. This is Doug. Maybe a little bit better. We certainly see a little bit of an uptick in utilization.
But I don't think it's meaningfully different, Stacy.
 -- 
Got it. So, it's kind of a noise.
 -- 
Yes, kind of a noise.
 -- 
Got it. OK. That's helpful. Thank you, guys.
Appreciate it.
Next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Given the strength in CSBG, it looks like utilization by your customer base continues to rise.
Did that also broaden out to start to include not just leading-edge logic, foundry, DRAM, and NAND, but maybe also start to include mature and specialty fabs as well? Or are at a minimum, mature and specialty utilization at least stabilizing in line with some of the cyclical improvements that we're seeing in the semi industry?
 -- 
Harlan, mature node stuff is still pretty soft, frankly. And I think you understand what's going on. I think just listen to everybody else's earnings calls in the analog, industrial, automotive space. And there's still a lot of inventory out there, it's still relatively soft.
The statements we're making on utilization have more to do with what we're seeing in the memory fabs, quite frankly.
 -- 
I appreciate that. And then on HBM and advanced packaging, I mean, last night, we heard AMD talk about supply dynamics being tight on their AI GPU supply next year, colos, and HBM on the custom ASIC front, we hear companies like Broadcom keep getting upside orders from their AI customers like Google. Last quarter, you talked about doing $1 billion in advanced packaging and HBM revenues this year. Has that number moved higher and is the team capacity constrained on advanced packaging systems and are your lead times here for those tools starting to stretch out?
 -- 
Well, it has moved higher, and we're not going to requantify it just yet, but it is -- we're seeing very strong demand in those areas. I talked about the expansion of our global manufacturing supply chain footprint. And obviously, that's giving us more flexibility than we had during the last ramp. Our goal through all those investments was to be able to respond in these next few years of expansion better than we did in the expansion that we saw right around the time of COVID.
And so, I think that that will position us. Sure, you're always a little bit short and customers always drop in tools within your lead time, which keeps you busy. But I think that we're doing quite a nice job responding to the urgent request from our customers. We actually like this.
I would say that generally from running the business, we like this environment where all parts of our business are a little bit supply constraint. I mean, you hear a lot of our customers talking about being cautious about adding capacity. Other customers talking about having a little trouble getting tools. I think that's a good place for us to be because it means that I think we're setting up for more manageable long-term ramp of demand than sort of a short spike followed by, again, periods of digestion that always creates a little bit of chaos in the industry.
 -- 
Thank you, Tim. Thanks, Doug.
 -- 
Thanks, Harlan.
Your next question comes from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Doug, if I look at the 2023 year-over-year China sales growth among the big five equipment makers. All of them are up quite well.
ASML is up like 250% and the U.S. peers are up in teens or 20%, but you guys were down 11% total China sales in 2023. And this year, you're expecting China sales to be up. So, I'm just trying to understand the dynamics last year.
Were this just a function of maybe NAND spending and the NAND project not being active or are there competitive elements in China that are working against you?
 -- 
Atif, I'll remind you that perhaps our largest customer got restricted when the regulations came out, our NAND customer in China. That customer was pretty strong in '22, went away in '23. So, the year-over-year comparisons you're making, you've got to factor that in. And then the strength we're seeing '23 to '24 is a different mix entirely, really not any NAND in China to speak of, at least not domestic China.
I don't know if that helps you, but make sure you're thinking about that.
 -- 
Yes, it all makes sense. That's helpful. And then on the cryo improvement, Tim, that you mentioned, are those improvements or process tool of record is going to solidify your market share next year or the year after?
 -- 
That's -- well, I think that all of these things when you introduce something new, I mean, I think what people kind of lose sight of this. Generally, we're working several years ahead with our customers on R&D. I talked about the investments we're making where we make -- we're building labs close to our customers in different geographies. That's because, in many cases, we're engaging those customers a good five years ahead of production implementation.
That's not to say Lam Cryo 3.0 take five years to get into production. But it's not technology that's ramping, say, this year, but it really is looking out at the needs of our customers wanted to generations out and really solving their difficult etch challenges. So, sometimes when the benefits are so good, and I talked about the fact that we get about 2.5 times etch rate, tremendous profile control customers will often pull that in sooner. But really, this is designed for kind of the 400-plus layer may ultimately end up being pulled in earlier than that, but that's where you really start to see the needs for this kind of capability.
 -- 
That's exactly I was asking about. It is 400 layers or 200 layers, but it sounds like 400 layers.
 -- 
Yes. And I think that what we -- you'll see in our press release today, we talked a little bit about we're trying to chart the path across not only etch but also our deposition films toward where the industry needs to go to get to 1,000 layers because we truly see over the next decade, that that's where you want to get in terms of satisfying bit density and cost as NAND demand continues to expand with AI.
 -- 
Great. Thank you.
 -- 
Thank you.
Next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking the questions. I joined late, so I do apologize if these questions have been addressed. Just on the third-generation cryo tool, Tim, that you spoke about.
How is this technology or tool fundamentally different or better than your nearest competitor? I know you just spoke to some of the characteristics, but if you can clarify that for us to the extent you're comfortable, that would be really, really helpful. And then my second question, again, on the CSBG side, probably one for Doug. And again, you may have address this. For the full year, calendar year, I think you previously said flattish, plus or minus.
Is that still the view? Or given the strength you saw in June, is that -- should we be thinking about a higher growth rate for the full year? Thank you.
 -- 
Maybe I'll take that one first, and then I'll let Tim comment on the 3.0 stuff. Yes. You might have missed my scripted statements. As we sit here today, we now expect that for 2024 CSBG, the word I used was modestly grow this year versus last year.
And part of that is we saw particularly strength -- that particular strength in the June quarter in Reliant, a little bit of an improvement in spares. And as we think about the utilization trends that are likely occurring with our memory customers, I think spares continues to be decent and we're optimistic that we'll start to see some of the upgrade spend that we've been talking about for a while. And I'll hand it over to Tim on the 3.0 stuff.
 -- 
Sure, Doug. Yes. I think, obviously, what I would just start with is the biggest difference between what we're delivering with Lam Cryo 3.0 and what our competitors do is in the results on the wafer, which we talked about pretty amazing 10-micron deep holes with less than a 10-nanometer taper from the top to bottom. At etch rates that are 2.5 times conventional etching.
So, it's the results that are pretty amazing. We talked about the fact that the -- this is based on some new surface chemistries that are enabled in our tool and there's a whole combination of hardware issue -- hardware configuration and capabilities in our tool that I think allow us to achieve that result. And I can't go into all of those details today, but it is I did allude to one of them, which is on our Vantex System. The chamber design allows us to deliver a significantly higher ion energy than what is available from any other system available in the semiconductor industry.
And that does play some role in etching these very, very deep near with -- holes with near-perfect verticality. So, that's about all I can say today.
 -- 
Thank you. Appreciate that.
Your next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask you -- I mean, there's been a number of press concerns about export controls with talking about the foreign direct product rule which doesn't seem like it would affect you, but also talking about entity list. And I'm just wondering, obviously, we don't know what would happen with any of that.
But are you seeing any different behavior from your China customers? Are you seeing them push things in or pull things -- push things out because of any of those anxieties?
 -- 
Yes. Joe, I think that, obviously, we don't know exactly what's going to happen either just as you said, and so we can't really speculate on that. I have mentioned in the last couple of calls that there are ongoing discussions all the time with the U.S. government and regulatory agencies were part of those discussions and we'll continue to be.
I think in terms of change in behavior by any of our customers, I don't think it's something that's noticeable nor would it be something that we would be able to easily react to. We've talked about how we deal with some of these new customers that emerge with down payments and other things to make sure that we understand the -- those customers as viable customers. But beyond that, we service them like others at this point as long as we can ship to them. And I would say lead times and responsiveness from our perspective is same as we treat any customers of those size.
 -- 
Very helpful. Thank you.
 -- 
Thanks, Joe.
Next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Hey. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I actually -- I know you got a couple on this, Doug, on the China business. I'm just kind of curious.
I think you qualified as a solid year next year, and I just didn't know what that meant. So, I know you've been hesitant to kind of call of China, I think you called it like flat, plus or minus, maybe up or down last time. Do you feel better about it, I guess, outside of this June that's the other kind of part of the question. Just if you can qualify a little bit.
I mean, you should have some idea of what you're going to ship that pay ahead. So, it was June kind of a cleanup, and it might be a little bit lumpy, and/or is China actually trending a bit better for you?
 -- 
I don't know, Blayne, that I'm trying to communicate anything any different than we said on the last call, to be honest with you. We described this year as somewhat first-half-weighted, really no change to that. The June quarter was maybe a little tiny bit stronger in China, but only a little tiny bit. It's too soon for me to -- for us to quantify 2025.
But what I would tell you is I expect next year to be a solid year in terms of spending in China. I'm not going to give you a number yet because I'm not completely sure. But what I wouldn't want anybody to think is it's going away because it's not.
 -- 
Gotcha. And then I'm just kind of curious, the broad strokes was growth for next year. I know you don't want to give a forecast. But in terms of the moving pieces there, I mean, it's pretty clear leading edge is strong, DRAM has been strong.
I'm just kind of curious as you look into that forecast, if you're willing to venture kind of a view on the NAND business.
 -- 
Yes. I think NAND spending next year has to be greater than it is this year, right? We're off two years of quite low spending in NAND. I don't know what magnitude. I expect next year, we expect next year, you're going to see a lot of upgrades in NAND.
But too soon for us to give you a number, but I would be shocked if it's not stronger than it is this year. It has to be.
 -- 
Thanks, Doug.
 -- 
Yes. Thanks, Blayne.
The next question comes from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Yes. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to try on the NAND side again. If we just think about your prior peak NAND revenue, ex customers that are obviously now restricted, can capacity upgrade to just higher layer counts support your return to those levels, just given your higher share of higher etch and depth intensity for the transitions?
 -- 
Joe, if it's just an upgrade your spending will be lower than when capacity gets added, obviously, our share of wallet will be greater. The fact that we lost a pretty large NAND customer in the China region, hard to replace that. I'm not ready to tell you what kind of next year is relative to previous peaks. But I know next year is going to be a stronger year than it is this year for sure.
 -- 
Yes. And Joe, I think that, obviously, we're talking next year, it's very specific to the demand environment and the upgrade business in 2025. Longer term, I mean, we've laid out, in our view, is that NAND spending rises. And so, it's just a matter of the time frame you're looking at.
And from the standpoint of Lam's business, the etch and depth components and the complexity of tier stacking the precision that's required for implementation of QLC and PLC technologies, all of these skewed toward Lam's technical strengths and also SAM expansion opportunities. I talked about the PECVD, pure carbon gap fill process, which is a new addition to the portfolio for NAND scaling technology going forward. And so, if I go back and I look at where we were in the portfolio, we had to sell, when people used to think of NAND is a very, very strong business for Lam, we've expanded that portfolio quite substantially with the gap fill, the backside stress management, the ALD oxide gap fill process plus the etch and stack debt that we've always had as well as our metallization. So, it's one of growth in NAND demand, but also growth in Lam's portfolio and served market as well opportunities ahead.
So, I think that bodes well for us once the NAND business itself starts to recover.
 -- 
That's helpful color. And just as a quick follow-up, you talked about global mature node spending being roughly flat this year. Can you just help us understand just kind of how does that break down? I mean, I think clearly, the non-China piece is pretty weak. But just any kind of color there you could help us parse that out.
 -- 
Yes. You answered your own question, Joe. China is decent right now. Outside of China, it's pretty soft.
And I think you understand what's going on. There's inventory that's built up, four days inventories still need to come down in the mature node, analog, industrial automotive space, and investment won't meaningfully occur until that gets adjusted. So, that's kind of what's going on. You sort of answered your own question.
 -- 
Fair enough. Thanks.
 -- 
Thanks, Joe.
Next question is a follow-up question from Krish Sankar. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Hi. Thanks for taking my follow-up. Doug, I just had a quick follow-up. It's a question on inventory.
You spoke about bringing inventory turns down. What kind of -- curious like how to think about inventory next year, especially you're planning for a strong WFE year in 2025. Or do you think most of this inventory would be in a bin, how to think about inventory next year? Thank you.
 -- 
Yes. Listen, if you think back to when business declined for us last year, a big part of what fell off pretty rapidly was our NAND business. And so, a lot of the inventory that we still have sitting on the balance sheet will support NAND. So, when assuming NAND is stronger next year, and it will be, we will consume that NAND inventory that's been sitting on the balance sheet for a while.
What will offset that to a certain extent is growth elsewhere, where we'll need to procure new inventory. So, I'm not ready to give you an inventory forecast quite yet, but we're continuing to work as we go through the remainder of this year to kind of bring it down, and then what we do with next year will depend largely on the timing of business, the mix of business, the geographic distribution of business, but we'd like to get turns back to where they historically have been and they're not there yet. So, that's how you should be thinking about it, Krish.
 -- 
Thank you. Very helpful. Thanks, Doug.
 -- 
Thanks.
Next question is from Melissa Weathers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Hi there. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to ask on the leading edge and specifically gate-all-around nodes. I don't think I heard an update to your $1 billion gate-all-around revenues in 2024 target.
So, is that still the case? And then as we think about those nodes ramping through next year, like what's the trajectory of that ramp that we should be thinking about as you move from pilot lines into high-volume manufacturing?
 -- 
Yes. Thanks, Melissa. I mean, we always make choices about what we do and don't include it in the prepared remarks and gate-all-around fell out this time, just no intended message. In fact, if I look at what happened in the quarter, Lam, again, as we've talked on previous calls, is really positioned quite nicely with our forward-looking etch and depth portfolios.
We really targeted those kind of markets with new tools in selected etch, which is a market we hadn't been in before. And in fact, in the quarter, we had additional selected etch wins for gate-all-around at multiple customers. We targeted investment in ALD films that are specifically needed for things like spacers and gate-all-around, and we had additional wins in the quarter for those films. Often with gate-all-around, we think of those -- they are obviously different technologies, but kind of occurring at the same node, the backside power delivery.
That's an area that is really right in our sweet spot in terms of deposition and etch. And in the quarter, we had wins in backside power in ALD oxide. And so, I would say net-net, I mean, given those wins and what you're hearing from the end markets about the need for high-power computing demand for AI, I think the $1 billion forecast we gave you, certainly, as we move through next year would be going higher. And so, again, that's a combination of rising demand, but also a product portfolio that's both expanding and one in which we're winning share.
And so, there was no message about leaving it off, but thank you for asking the question so we could get that in right at the end.
 -- 
OK. Thank you. That's all my questions there.
 -- 
Awesome. Operator, I think that concludes our call. I want to thank everybody for joining us today. We look forward to seeing you at a variety of conferences and interactions as we go through the remainder of the quarter.
Appreciate it.
 -- 
Thank you.

JD, TJX, TPR: Which Retail Stock Is the Strongest Buy? 2024-08-01T04:08:59.000Z

The broader basket of retail stocks may not have been dealt the best hand in the world at the start of this year, with consumers continuing to hurt from inflation, geopolitical turmoil, and macro headwinds. Now that inflation is approaching its target (in the ballpark of 2%), it’s becoming less of a problem.
Still, don’t count on consumers to be any less selective, cost-conscious, and cautious, as the price increases from past years are in the books, so to speak — that is, unless some goods are in for a bit of deflation (think fast food) in the coming quarters. At this juncture, it’s likely best to be optimistic but still somewhat cautious when it comes to the retailers as a whole.
Like in the fast food scene, discounts and a high perception of value could continue to be the key to success in this 
.
Shares of Chinese e-tailer 
. Undoubtedly, the multi-month plunge followed an underwhelming (but in-line) first-quarter showing that saw revenue rise 7% while operating profit fell 5%. The quarter may have been nothing to write home about, but with lower expectations, a depressed valuation, and ambitious expansion efforts, I’m inclined to stay bullish on the stock.
Perhaps the biggest draw to JD stock is the rock-bottom multiple. At 7.8 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E), JD is close to the cheapest it’s been in the past year.
The Chinese economy may be in a historic slump, and, of course, there are geopolitical uncertainties to account for. Either way, patient investors with a high pain tolerance may wish to back JD on the cheap as China attempts to turn a corner while JD looks to pull off a Temu of sorts by expanding internationally.
Unlike Temu, which sells dirt-cheap items at rock-bottom prices, JD tends to sell higher-quality, authentic products at still reasonable prices. When it comes to aggressive discounting, Temu is tough to top. However, JD may find success internationally as it brings goods that offer more on the quality front.
More recently, JD reportedly showed interest in buying British parcel firm Evri, a deal that could help accelerate its European expansion. I think acquiring its way to a solid logistical foundation is a pretty smart way to kick the international expansion into high gear. Whether such efforts to grow beyond China pay off in the medium term, though, remains to be seen.
JD stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 14 Buys and three Holds assigned in the past three months. The 
 of $40.58 implies 53.8% upside potential.
TJX is a discount retailing juggernaut that’s been in an unstoppable rally since bottoming out in the middle of 2022. The company behind TJ Maxx, Homesense, and Marshalls offers a wide range of brand-name merchandise at competitive prices. In the U.S., bargain hunting has kept TJX head and shoulders above most other retailers. And as TJX eyes an international expansion, there are reasons to believe TJX stock’s great bull run has legs. All things considered, I’m staying bullish on the off-price retailer.
In the (latest) first quarter of Fiscal Year 2025, TJX saw net sales grow 6% while comparable store sales crept 3% higher. Clearly, demand for a bargain has remained robust, even as inflation hit the brakes. What’s more remarkable is that the firm seems to have done a good job of maintaining inventory levels. After all, there’s nothing more off-putting than going to the local Winners or TJ Maxx to find a bunch of empty racks and shelves after other shoppers have scooped up the bargains with both hands.
Looking ahead, the firm sees comparable sales rising by 4%. That’s pretty impressive. But what’s even more impressive is the company’s expansion, which will see “at least another 1,300” new stores be opened. Ascending comparable sales and a solid store expansion plan is a formula for surging earnings and, with that, a rising stock.
At 26.8 times forward P/E, TJX stock looks quite rich now compared to the past-year range. However, when you consider the winning formula and continued demand for value, the premium seems more than warranted.
TJX stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 17 Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. The 
 of $116.25 implies 2.7% upside potential.
Tapestry is a firm behind affordable luxury and fashion brands such as Coach and Kate Spade. These brands are a relatively cheap way for some to look and feel rich. The stock has been on an awful run since peaking back in February. Now down more than 17% from 52-week highs, questions linger as to how Tapestry can lift itself off the canvas following a mediocre third quarter that saw sales 
. With a depressed multiple and a potential path higher, I’m staying bullish.
Currently, the stock is trading at 8.1x forward P/E, which puts it at the low end of the past year’s historical range. With new product innovations over at Coach, like the Quilted Tabby, perhaps Tapestry can convince consumers to loosen the purse strings a bit, even as luxury demand (especially affordable luxury) hits a bit of a soft spot.
For now, it looks like Tapestry’s bid to buy Capri 
 is dead in the water. Either way, Tapestry has more than enough dry powder to make deals elsewhere. Maybe now is as good a time as any to pursue other opportunities while the industry is still in a tough spot.
TPR stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with eight Buys and one Hold assigned in the past three months. The 
 of $50.50 implies 26% upside potential.
The following retail plays look quite enticing, according to numerous Wall Street analysts. Whether we’re talking about JD and its international push, TJX and its own expansion, or Tapestry and its fashionable new Coach bags and war chest, each name has overlooked strengths that may yet be factored into the share price. Of the trio, Wall Street sees JD as having the most room to gain (53.9%!) in the year ahead.

Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): Among the Top Stock Bets of a $3 Billion Hedge Fund? 2024-08-01T04:27:11.000Z

We recently compiled a list of 
. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other stock bets of a $3 billion hedge fund.
 is a hedge fund specializing in long/short equity strategies. Based in New York City's Hudson Yards, its founders and industry veterans, Richard Schimel and Larry Sapanski, aim to redefine the multi-manager model with an evolved approach to portfolio management. The firm provides a multi-manager investment platform to its investors combining fundamental stock picking with proprietary quantitative tools with a focus on scrupulous risk management practices to ensure robust investment strategies. According to Schimel, “Cinctive is the evolution of the experiences Larry and I had over the past two decades.”
Richard Schimel and Lawrence Sapanski founded Cinctive Capital Management in 2019. Since its inception, the hedge fund's assets have nearly quadrupled. Sapanski and Schimel have worked together for 14 years. Back in 2005, Larry also co-founded 
, managing significant assets in financials, energy, bonds, and macro strategies. In the early 2000s, Rich Schimel and Lawrence Sapanski worked for Steve Cohen's SAC Capital Advisors. They founded Diamondback Capital Management in 2005, which managed $5.8 billion in assets. However, the firm closed in 2012 due to client withdrawals following a non-prosecution agreement related to an insider trading investigation. However, the government later dropped the agreement and Diamondback was refunded the $9 million after the conviction was tossed out.
In addition to managing and founding Cinctive Capital Management and the aforementioned ventures, both the Co-Founders and Co-CIOs have held many distinctive roles in the past. Richard Schimel was a Senior Managing Director and Head of Aptigon Capital at Citadel. He also served as Chief Investment Officer at Sterling Ridge Capital Management, which he founded in 2013. Schimel holds a B.A. in Economics from the University of Michigan. Larry Sapanski also brings over 30 years of investment management experience to the Cinctive family. Larry Sapanski paved a similar path for himself like his fellow Richard Schimel before co-founding Cinctive. He started a hedge fund called 
 (2013-2017) where he served as CIO, overseeing trading, risk exposures, and a best ideas portfolio. Larry Sapanski has held various trading roles at London Bishopgates International, Lehman Brothers, Deutsche Bank, and Morgan Stanley. Sapanski graduated from St. John's University with a B.S. in Accounting.
According to the Form ADV filed on March 2024, Cinctive Capital Management disclosed that they are serving 8 clients with discretionary assets under management totaling $3,019,428,000. Their most recent 13F filing for Q4 2023 revealed managed 13F securities amounting to $1,505,809,649, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 17.76%.
Currently, Cinctive Capital Management has been successful in betting on artificial intelligence in energy, technology, and utility sector-related stocks as it ended the first half of the year gaining 11%. Its performance has also been noteworthy while betting in other sectors such as Financials, healthcare, and biotech thereby beating other big multi-strategy hedge funds, such as Citadel and Millennium. The successful track record at Diamondback has allowed Rich Schimel and Lawrence Sapanski to draw noteworthy interest from institutional investors for their venture, Cinctive Capital Management. This achievement comes despite the broader hedge fund industry's increased scrutiny from investors over subpar returns.
Stocks mentioned in this article were picked from the investment portfolio of Cinctive Capital Management at the end of the first quarter of 2024. Schimel and Sapanski's top 5 stock picks returned an average of 11% since the end of the first quarter, vs. 4% gain for the broader indices for large-cap stocks.

Decoding Qualcomm Inc (QCOM): A Strategic SWOT Insight 2024-08-01T05:07:11.000Z

On July 31, 2024, Qualcomm Inc (
) filed its 
 report, revealing a company that continues to thrive in the dynamic and competitive landscape of wireless technology and chip manufacturing. The filing date marks an opportune moment to conduct a SWOT analysis, providing investors with a comprehensive view of the company's financial health and strategic positioning. Qualcomm's financial tables from the recent 10-Q filing indicate a strong financial performance, with total revenues climbing to $9.393 billion in Q3 2024, up from $8.451 billion in the same quarter of the previous year. Net income also saw a significant uptick, rising to $2.129 billion from $1.803 billion. These figures underscore Qualcomm's solid operational execution and its ability to capitalize on the growing demand for advanced wireless technologies and devices.
 Qualcomm Inc (
) stands out as a leader in the development and commercialization of foundational wireless technologies. Its strong brand and extensive patent portfolio, particularly in CDMA and OFDMA technologies, give it a competitive edge in the 3G, 4G, and 5G markets. The company's ability to innovate and drive industry standards has resulted in a dominant position in wireless chip manufacturing, with a broad customer base that includes nearly every premier handset maker.
 The company's financial health is robust, as evidenced by the latest 10-Q filing. Qualcomm's revenue and net income have shown impressive growth, with an 11% increase in quarterly revenues and an 18% rise in net income compared to the previous year. This financial strength is indicative of efficient operations, a strong product mix, and the ability to command premium pricing due to its technological leadership.
 Qualcomm's reliance on a small number of customers and licensees for a significant portion of its revenue poses a risk. The company's performance is heavily dependent on the sales of premium tier handset devices from these entities. Any fluctuations in their sales or shifts in their strategic direction could adversely impact Qualcomm's business outcomes.
 As a fabless semiconductor company, Qualcomm depends on third-party suppliers for the procurement, manufacture, assembly, and testing of its products. This reliance on external partners exposes the company to risks associated with supply chain disruptions, which could affect its ability to deliver products on time and maintain its profit margins.
 Qualcomm has the opportunity to leverage its technological expertise to expand into new and emerging markets beyond mobile handsets, such as automotive, Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing. The company's research and development efforts in these areas could lead to new revenue streams and diversification of its business portfolio.
 The global transition to 5G technology represents a significant opportunity for Qualcomm. As a pioneer in 5G, the company is well-positioned to benefit from the increased demand for 5G-enabled devices and infrastructure, potentially leading to higher licensing revenues and chipset sales.
 Qualcomm's significant business concentration in China, coupled with ongoing U.S./China trade and national security tensions, presents a threat to its operations. Any escalation in these tensions could lead to regulatory challenges, tariffs, or restrictions that may hinder Qualcomm's ability to operate effectively in this key market.
 The wireless technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change and fierce competition. Qualcomm must continuously innovate and adapt to maintain its market position. Failure to keep pace with technological advancements or to respond effectively to competitive pressures could result in decreased demand for its products and a decline in market share.
In conclusion, Qualcomm Inc (
) exhibits a strong competitive position, underpinned by its innovative technology, robust financial performance, and strategic market opportunities. However, the company must navigate challenges such as customer concentration, supply chain dependencies, geopolitical risks, and the fast-paced nature of the tech industry. By leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses, Qualcomm can capitalize on the opportunities presented by 5G and new market segments while mitigating the threats posed by external factors. This SWOT analysis provides investors with a nuanced understanding of Qualcomm's strategic position, informing their investment decisions in the context of the company's potential for sustained growth and profitability.

Overall, the vast majority of our rollout toward our transformation to becoming consumption-oriented is complete, a step change in how we run our Cloud business. One success indicator for our transformation is new logo growth.
I'm pleased to share that we increased our total customer count by 320 in Q2, double from the previous quarter and representing our largest sequential increase in two years. In addition to landing a higher volume of customers, we believe we have increased the quality. A strong focus on our target accounts has increased the percentage of high-propensity customer lands. Though this new consumption motion lands them earlier in their journey, we believe over time, many of these customers will represent the next wave of high consumption accounts for us.
We remain as confident as ever in the strategic position of the company and the prospects for durable long-term growth. We have the industry-leading technology in an increasingly critical and relevant category that we believe will be as important as databases. Over the past year, we've made a series of innovations to build out the full set of capabilities of a data streaming platform, enabling us to capture the full lifecycle of data in motion. And as we progress along our consumption transformation, we will be better equipped than ever to rapidly acquire new customers, win new workloads, and fuel the adoption of our full set of product capabilities.
Our rapid pace of innovation and ability to land high-quality customers who have the potential to consume more of our product leave me more excited than ever about the long-term opportunity to capture the lion's share of the data streaming market. Vimeo, a leading SaaS video platform with over 260 million users, is a great example of a customer using our complete data streaming platform. Success for video platforms like Vimeo largely depends on delivering stellar user experiences, but traditional data warehousing and batch ETL processes limited their ability to see real-time customer usage, hindering timely decisions, quick pivots on products, and campaigns and adaptive user experiences without buffering. So, they turned to Confluent to enable real-time data flows that provided the visibility they lacked.
Fully managed connectors to Snowflake, S3, and others make it easy to instantly connect data through their business without the hassle of building and self-managing connectors. Stream Governance ensures data quality and security and allows Vimeo to safely scale and share data streams. And the team is looking toward Flink to enhance their streaming use cases while freeing up bandwidth across the team. With Confluent and real-time data flows, Vimeo can make quick decisions and deliver top-quality personalized experiences that drive growth and profitability.
Next, I'd like to discuss the critical role our partners play in our business and some exciting announcements in this area. Partners are essential to our strategy to expand our reach into new markets, improve sales efficiency, and complement our data streaming platform. We're pleased to share a number of notable achievements and milestones across all three pillars of our partner ecosystem. In Q2, we announced Build with Confluent and Accelerate with Confluent, which makes it easier for our global SI partners like KPMG, Accenture, and EY to build specialized offerings as they embed data streaming into their core business.
A wide range of use cases have already been established through the Build with Confluent program, including a GenAI bot for airline customer support, fraud detection against AI-powered voice phishing, automated limit increases for credit card users, and real-time telemetry analysis for freight optimization. We're also seeing great traction with Connect with Confluent, a technology partner program that makes it easier for partners to build data integrations with Confluent Cloud. In Q2, we crossed more than 40 technology partner-built integrations, including SAP, MongoDB, [Inaudible], and services at Google Cloud and AWS, giving us coverage across the major segments of the modern data and AI stack to help us drive consumption of Confluent. The success of Connect with Confluent has tripled the amount of data traffic from our partner integration since the start of the year.
And finally, on the CSP front, we were pleased to be recognized as Partners of the Year by both Google and Microsoft. This marks the third year in a row that Confluent won this award from Microsoft and the fifth year that we've been recognized by Google. Together, these recognitions underscore our highly valuable and symbiotic relationship with our cloud partners. As we discussed last quarter, data streaming plays a critical role in fueling GenAI applications with contextual and trustworthy streams of real-time data.
This was underscored by our 2024 data streaming report. 90% of the 4,000-plus IT leaders we surveyed said data streaming platforms can lead to more product and service innovation in AI and ML development, with 63% saying data streaming platforms significantly fuel AI progress by building a real-time data foundation. I'm pleased to share a couple of examples of this. A top five mortgage lender in the United States is turning to Confluent and GenAI to reimagine the home buying experience.
This company uses generative AI to listen to client calls, transcribe them, analyze sentiment, and record client patterns and preferences to create personalized experiences for millions of customers and prospects. They turn to Confluent as a key part of their RAG-enabled architecture to quickly build and scale GenAI use cases by tapping into readily usable trustworthy data streams. Connectors allow them to connect data and systems from across lines of business, while Stream Governance and Stream Processing enabled the team to create reusable data products that are easy to find, understand, and use. As a result of their GenAI initiatives, approximately 70% of servicing calls can be fully self-served without the need for full team member intervention.
By saving the client servicing team 40,000 hours annually, team members can concentrate on cultivating strong, meaningful client relationships, while AI manages the mundane tasks. But this is just the start. In the future, their GenAI platform will earn homeowners' preferences and communication habits so that team members can anticipate and solve clients' needs. An international e-commerce company in Germany with EUR 16 billion in annual sales is another example of companies turning to Confluent to play a key role in their GenAI stack.
When e-commerce products from this company's iconic brands are promoted, their call centers receive massive spikes in call volume. But with only 100 call center reps, customers are often left in long wait queues, leading to failed convergence and unhappy customers. So, they turned to Confluent to help power GenAI applications like voice bots that can scale up in seconds and answer 1,000 calls in parallel. As customers interact with these voice bots, an AI order entry bot enables the order completion process and communicates with ERP systems in real-time via Confluent, streaming transactional data such as product, order, customer, payment, and billing information.
A key part of this workflow is Confluent's streaming KPIs from bots in the operational domain to their analytical systems, capturing data like real-time orders, call metrics, sentiment analysis, and how many AI tokens were used to analyze and measure the efficacy of calls to continuously make their bots smarter and more effective. Powered by enriched trusted data streams from Confluent, this e-commerce company can now handle unexpected traffic spikes to increase call center capacity on demand to reduce customer wait times and improve order completion rate. In closing, we're excited about the trajectory we're on. With our complete data streaming platform and our transition to a consumption-oriented business, we're well-positioned to attract more customers who can drive even more value from Confluent as they capture the full lifecycle of streaming data from our platform.
The future of Confluent is incredibly bright. With that, I'll turn it over to Rohan.

Thanks, Jay. Good afternoon, everyone. In Q2, we delivered solid subscription revenue growth and substantial margin expansions, ending the quarter with positive non-GAAP operating margin and free cash flow margin. These results, coupled with the continued adoption of our data streaming platform, demonstrate our relentless focus on driving long-term efficient growth in a volatile macro environment.
Turning to the Q2 results. Subscription revenue grew 27% to $224.7 million, exceeding the high end of our guidance and representing 96% of total revenue. Confluent Platform revenue growth accelerated to 16%, ending the quarter at $107.3 million and accounting for 48% of subscription revenue. We closed two eight-figure multiyear deals consisting of renewal and expansion with existing customers in the financial services industry.
This underscores Confluent as the platform of choice for data streaming among the world's most established enterprises. Confluent Cloud revenue grew 40% to $117.4 million and accounted for 52% of subscription revenue compared to 47% in the year-ago quarter. We are pleased with delivering high growth at scale and continuing to improve the margin profile for our cloud business. Turning to the geographic mix of total revenue.
Revenue from the U.S. grew 26% to $143.2 million. Revenue from outside the U.S. grew 22% to $91.7 million.
Moving on to the rest of the income statement. I'll be referring to non-GAAP results, unless stated otherwise. Subscription gross margin was 80.8%, up 170 basis points. Gross margin performance was driven by strong Confluent platform margin and improving unit economics of our Confluent Cloud offering.
Turning to profitability and cash flow. Operating margin expanded 9.7 percentage points to 0.6%, representing our eighth consecutive quarter of nine points or more in margin improvement. Operating margin performance was driven by our gross margin performance and our continued focus on driving efficient growth across the company. Net income per share was $0.06 for Q2 using 354.2 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding.
Fully diluted share count under the treasury stock method was approximately 362.9 million. Free cash flow margin turned positive and improved approximately 20 percentage points to 1.2%. And we ended second quarter with $1.93 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Turning now to other business metrics.
Total customer count was approximately 5,440, up 320 customers sequentially, our largest sequential growth in two years. We are pleased with accelerating growth in total customer count and the quality of customers we have acquired. Additionally, we added 46 customers with $100,000 plus in ARR and nine customers in $1 million plus in ARR, bringing the total to 1,306 and 177, respectively. Our $100,000-plus ARR customers continue to contribute greater than 85% of our revenue.
Our new $1 million-plus ARR customers include customers from a variety of industries, including energy, financial services, manufacturing, retail, transportation, and more. Turning to NRR. Q2 NRR was 118%, below our target range of 120% to 125% for this year. This was due to continuing consumption volatility within our large digital native customer base.
After the stabilization in Q1 and a healthy start in Q2, we saw increased short-term cloud cost controls and focused on driving efficiencies in this customer cohort in the month of June, which impacted expansion of new use cases. While the green shoots we saw earlier this year haven't yet translated to the level of consumption we had expected, we are pleased to see continued strength in our gross retention rate. GRR remained above 90% at a level consistent with the last two quarters, reflecting the sticky nature of our data streaming platform and our continued focus on delivering strong value and ROI to our customers. As we frame our guidance for the second half of 2024, there are two points I would like to call out before getting into the numbers.
First, growth of our Confluent Platform business remains lumpy, driven by the timing of large renewal and expansion deals. As a reminder, approximately 20% of our Confluent Platform TCV is recognized as upfront license revenue. This could create short-term variability for growth in Confluent Platform. Q2 was a good example where we benefited from this dynamic, which creates a tough comparison for growth for the rest of 2024.
Second, consumption in our digital native customer base remains volatile. As mentioned, while the green shoots we saw over the last few months continue to take hold, they have not yet translated to the level of consumption we had expected. We have incorporated this consumption dynamic from our large digital native customers into our second half outlook. Now let's turn to guidance.
For the third quarter of 2024, we expect subscription revenue to be in the range of $233 million to $234 million, representing growth of approximately 23% to 24%; non-GAAP operating margin to break even, representing improvement of approximately five percentage points; and non-GAAP net income per diluted share to be $0.05. For the full year 2024, we expect subscription revenue to be approximately $910 million, representing growth of approximately 25%; non-GAAP operating margin to break even, representing an improvement of approximately seven percentage points; non-GAAP net income per diluted share to be $0.20; and free cash flow margin to break-even, representing improvement of approximately 16 percentage points. Looking out longer term, we remain well positioned to address our market opportunity. As Jay pointed out earlier, we're going after a highly strategic and mission-critical data streaming market, which we believe will be as important as databases.
Over the last few decades, history in software has repeated itself many times that platform approach wins. Our industry-leading data streaming platform is the only complete platform spanning stream, connect, process, and govern, enabling us to capture the full lifecycle of data in motion at a lower TCO and delivering strong ROI to our customers. In Q2, we saw continued adoption of our data streaming platform. Connect, process, and govern of our DSP portfolio accounted for a larger portion of cloud revenue and grew substantially faster than our overall Cloud business.
Multiproduct customers remained our fastest-growing customer cohort, with NRR substantially higher than 130%. We believe DSP will continue to outgrow our core business for the foreseeable future. And as it continues to scale, DSP is expected to be a strong growth tailwind to our business over a long period of time. Additionally, the rise of GenAI makes it clear that a modern organization success is significantly influenced by its data strategy, particularly around data and motion.
With a complete cloud-native and ubiquitous platform and secular tailwinds for data in motion, we have never been more confident in our ability to sustain durable and efficient growth over the long term. In closing, we are pleased with our solid second quarter results. As we continue to execute on our consumption transformation, we remain focused on driving efficient growth and delivering break-even for non-GAAP operating margin and free cash flow margin for 2024. Now, Jay and I will take your questions.
 -- 
Thanks, Rohan. [Operator Instructions] And today, we will take our first question from Matt Hedberg with RBC, followed by Morgan Stanley.
 -- 
Great. Thanks for taking my question, guys. I'm in the airport. So, hopefully the background noise is OK.
Jay, I noticed the strong customer logo ads stood out to me. I think you noted in your prepared remarks, the quality was also higher. I guess does that imply that you could see faster expansion from this cohort as they continue to advance with the platform?
 -- 
Yeah, over time. So, one of the measures we -- first of all, I would say, as we undertook this consumption transformation, one of our key goals was to accelerate customer acquisition. So, that's played out as we desired. The second thing that we were aiming for was to be a little more targeted in which customers we're landing in.
And so, we built a model to try to predict the opportunity in these customers and tagged a set of accounts we felt were high propensity. So, the measure we use internally is what percentage of these new customer lands are in that high propensity segment. And so, obviously, it's on us to go drive the growth in the accounts. But one of the things we think is promising is that that percentage has gone up substantially when we look at the first half of this year versus last year in the customers we're landing in.
 -- 
Got it. Thank you. And then maybe one for you, Rohan. You noted some of the NRR pressure and the potential for lumpy Confluent Platform business in the second half.
It seems like that's contemplated in your guidance. I guess I'm curious, after you saw -- it sounds like a little bit of slowness in June. How did things trend in July? I mean have you seen things kind of stabilized a bit? Or just maybe a little bit more on the linearity on the cloud side. Thanks.
 -- 
Yeah. Thanks for your question, Matt. Yeah. I mean, from an overall guidance perspective, as you rightly pointed out, we've considered two factors: our Confluent Platform business tends to be lumpy, primarily because of how the rev rec is and the timing of some of the larger deals.
So, that's incorporated in the guide. And the second one that you mentioned was around the digital native customers. So, for digital native customers, Q1, we saw stabilization. And as we entered Q2, we did see a continuation of that stabilization.
However, I would say toward the latter half of the quarter, we did see cost efficiencies and focused on just driving some cost efficiencies from some of these customers, which actually continued into the month of July. So, as we think of the back half of the year, we think taking a thoughtful and prudent approach to guidance would be the right thing to do.
 -- 
Thanks, guys.
 -- 
Thanks, Matt. We'll take our next question from Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley, followed by Barclays.
 -- 
Thank you for taking the question. I want to turn back to the sort of go-to-market transformation. I think there was an approach to utilize similar sales motions like MongoDB, who've done monitoring cloud sales. One of the things that they have been seeing is that as they try and incent for more volume and higher volumes of workloads, the quality 12 months down the road wasn't what they expected.
I was wondering, Jay -- I'm happy to see the new customer logos really accelerate. But if you look at it on a workload basis, how are you guys thinking about ensuring quality of the workloads and not just seeing that increased volume?
 -- 
Yeah. That's obviously on us to ensure that we're kind of getting the growth and expansion out of this customer set. The first indication is just, are we getting into the right customer? So, I think that, we've seen. As we think about over the course of this year, we want to see those grow.
Part of our objective was definitely to get into customers earlier in the lifecycle, earlier in the development lifecycle where they're actually setting up the architecture where they can use more of our DSP in the first application they're planning. I think that's been successful, and that's allowed us to take up the volume of customers. But yeah, really showing how those play out and spill into the $100,000-plus, $1 million-plus, that will happen over time.
 -- 
Great. And then just as a follow-up. How are you guys thinking about when you look at the pieces of a real time on data infrastructure, I think OpenAI bought what's called like a real-time database. And you guys have sort of talked about the streaming platform, the stream processing platform.
Where does the real-time database sort of fit in? And is that something that another service offering that Confluent may get involved with over time?
 -- 
Yeah. We actually partner very closely with a number of providers of similar functionality. So, I think Rockset was the company that OpenAI announced having bought. There's probably half a dozen to a dozen companies in that segment where they're taking streams of data and serving different types of queries against those streams.
And that's a great set of partners for us. And we work with them around a whole set of applications, including some in the GenAI space, use cases around search, use cases around real-time analytics, use cases around aggregating, and storing other key information sets that power workloads. So, there's definitely kind of a nice integration there between some of the real-time databases or streaming databases and the rest of the streaming platform. Thanks, Jeff.
 -- 
Thanks, Dan. And we'll take our next question from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays, followed by Deutsche.
 -- 
Hey, thank you. Two very quick questions. First, you had a bit of a change in the sales leadership. And I wanted to see if you could give us some additional comments there? And then Jay, on Flink as well, we kind of have it in the market for a few months now, and you kind of mentioned some of that on the call, but what's your experience and so far in terms of adoption, what people are using for versus what you expected on the usage side? Thank you.
 -- 
Yeah. Both good questions. So, yeah, we did have one departure on the sales side. The structure of our team is the larger field effort, the reps, technical folks, BD folks, consulting, who's all under Erica Schultz.
So, she's kind of at the top of the sales organization and reports to me. She remains in charge of that, and she has been at Confluent for over four years. So, there's a fair amount of continuity. Under her, the managers, management structure of the reps just kind of bounced back and forth between something where she manages the individual theater leaders like Apache or MINA directly or as somebody who manages that set of theater leaders.
And so, we did make a change in that structure. I won't comment on the departure in detail, but we're not planning on immediately backfilling it. We're comfortable with the arrangement we've had. And that's worked well for us in the past, and we feel good about that in the near term.
On Flink, yeah, it continues to go well. This is a time of excitement from our customers. I think last quarter, we said on the order of around 600 prospects and customers that tried it out. That's up to over 1,000 now.
We're starting to see really nice growth in the revenue from that. But of course, it's still early days, small numbers. What we want to see is see that ramp to a larger percentage of the business, see more of the kind of large-scale production use cases come online. That's what we're looking for over the course of this year.
And if we're successful in that, that will be a very positive tailwind for the business overall as it gets to a larger portion of the business heading into next year.
 -- 
OK. Perfect. Thank you.
 -- 
Thanks, Raimo. We'll take our next question from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche, followed by William Blair.
 -- 
Thanks very much, Shane. And great to see the progress of the new logo and the path to profitability. Rohan, you characterized digital native customers as volatile. What's the behavior that you're seeing specifically? Are they down-selling? Or are they churning? And is this more cloud or Confluent platform? How much of a risk is this going forward and the extent to which you're embedding it in the guide?
 -- 
Yeah. Thanks for the question, Brad. I mean when you look at the digital native segment and customers and if you zoom out and look at it over a longer period of time, the growth has been linear. And our growth has been upward but not linear.
So, over a period of time, the segment, we've seen good growth, and the growth rates have been higher than the rate of the company. But when you really look at the last 12-odd months, this segment has been under some kind of cost efficiency pressure. And you do see every now and then customers just focusing on the cost side of it and then adding more workloads. So, that is a trend that we've seen.
But the big takeaway from my perspective is if you step back and look at it over a longer period of time, this segment has been actually a good grower for us. And that's a long-term outlook. But as you think about how we saw the month of June, we thought it's just prudent to make it into our second half outlook as we look ahead.
 -- 
Yeah, I think that's a good characterization. I mean when we step back and think about the digital native segment, overall, we remain very optimistic that that's an area that's grown for us very nicely over the last few years, and we think we'll continue that way. But as Rohan said, yes, there is probably more cost pressure there, and that does mean that if we look at Q1 to Q2, we did see different performance in that segment between those two quarters where we saw outsized growth in Q1 and a little bit more optimization in Q2. And I think that's kind of the balance of those two forces.
We expect that to play out in the second half of the year as well.
 -- 
Thanks, Jay. And maybe just a quick follow-up for you. I see you have a number of open job reqs for AEs in the U.S. federal market.
Can you just remind us of where you stand in that market? And if you see upside in this Q3 that could come from federal? Or is this more of a 2025 opportunity?
 -- 
Thanks. Yeah, yeah. By and large, open sales hires in the federal space that we're making in this next quarter would impact next year. But indeed, there's a very talented team that covers the public sector in the U.S.
and elsewhere. And it's a good contributor to the business. So, yeah, we're adding to that team, and we do think that's an area where we will see growth.
 -- 
Cool. Thanks, Jay. Keep up the good work, guys.
 -- 
Thanks. We'll take our next question from Jason Ader with William Blair, followed by TD Cowen.
 -- 
Thanks, Shane. Good afternoon, everyone. I just want to ask about go-to-market. It seems like it's been a bit of an evolution over the last several years, and you guys are still kind of figuring it out.
Beyond the change to consumption and the management structure that you alluded to, what else would you call out that you've learned that could help move the needle on your go-to-market motion and where the best bang for the buck investments are going forward?
 -- 
Yeah, it's a good question. If I think about the first half of this year, it was mostly that shift to consumption. It's kind of rebuilding what you had on a new foundation around a different set of metrics, oriented on something new. If I think about the balance of the year and beyond, it's really taking advantage of that structure.
I do think that's the right setup for the type of cloud infrastructure company that we are. If you look at the peer companies and what the cloud providers have done over time to drive growth of workload, it really hinges around that. And so I feel good about the progress we've made and some of the early results from that. But I think it's even more exciting when we think about how we can use that to drive the adoption of these expansion product areas and the expansion of new workloads in the customer base.
 -- 
And then just a quick follow-up. On the consumption transition you talked about, I think you said smaller lands, Jay, is that right?
 -- 
Yeah, yeah. If I think about what we've shown, we've kind of taken up the volume of lands, but we will be catching these kind of earlier in the build cycle. We think that's largely good, but it does mean in that first quarter, the contribution from a given customer will be smaller than it was in the past, just because we're earlier in that project lifecycle.
 -- 
Thank you.
 -- 
Thanks, Jason. We'll take our next question from Derrick Wood with TD Cowen, followed by D.A. Davidson.
 -- 
Great. Thanks. Jay, in terms of the new motions of cross-selling DSP to the base, can you talk about what parts of that portfolio are seeing the strongest uptake when you look at governance, connectors, and processors? Is there anything you'd highlight getting more traction? And when you sell to a core customer, what's often the ASP uplift when you cross-sell one of those components?
 -- 
Yeah, yeah. It's a good question. Yes. I would think of each of those products as being in a kind of S-curve, where it's on some ramp.
The earliest of those was our connector ecosystem where we continue to make improvements and drive growth with it. We think there's a lot of opportunity there. The governance portfolio was next, and Flink is the newest addition to that. And so, I think there's interest and traction around all three, but Connect is the bigger business out of those three just because it started earlier.
When we think about kind of percentage growth, of course, you see the highest percentage of Flink because it's starting from the small space. And so, we want to continue to ramp all three of those, but we expect the attach from those components to increase quite substantially in the year ahead as we open that up to more customers. What drives that is, in part, maturity of the product, a lot of the security, kind of private networking functionality, other things that are important for our largest revenue customers to use those components are either just added or just being added over the course of this year, and that really opens up a lot more of the large-scale production usage to the rest of our customer base. And so, that's a critical focus for us when we think about the balance of the year.
We haven't given an exact kind of uplift number. We shared a little bit of kind of sketch of the shape of that business so far. I think, to be honest, I think it's still early days as these components ramp, even a customer that's adopted connectors. There's more of them they can use.
Even if they have their first few Flink queries, we would like to take over a substantial portion of their applications in the stream processing layer. And so, I wouldn't think of that as a dynamic uplift of like, oh, you'll see x percent and it's binary, either on or off. I would see this is kind of unlocking an adoption cycle that drives growth not just in core Kafka, but now in these components as well, which will themselves produce more growth in the underlying Kafka usage.
 -- 
Yeah. That makes a lot of sense. Rohan, for you. Last quarter, I think you highlighted targets of getting to 125% NRR next year.
Given that NRR dropped below 120% and you're seeing some different behavior, how does this kind of change your view on where you think you can get to in fiscal '25 on NRR?
 -- 
Yeah. Derrick, I mean when I really look at the medium term, as Jay highlighted right now, the outlook has not changed at all. I'll basically talk about three things. First, data streaming platform.
And as Jay just pointed out, the products within our data streaming platform, be it Connect, Stream Processing, or Flink or Governance, they are all early stages of adoption. And 2025 is going to be the year where there is going to be monetization and material contribution to revenue. The second is around consumption transformation. By the time we finish the year, we'll have completed a full year of the transformation and a full year of fine-tuning our go-to-market all things consumption.
So, we expect to get a tailwind from that. And the third category is GenAI. We've been talking to customers and Jay highlighted also in his prepared remarks, real-time data is going to be a key component and key part of this broader ecosystem. So, when you really take a step back and look at some of these drivers and vectors of growth, our view around NRR getting back to our medium-term targets has not changed.
 -- 
Thank you for the color.
 -- 
Thanks, Derrick. We'll take our next question from Rudy Kessinger with D.A. Davidson, followed by Wolfe Research.
 -- 
Hey, guys, can you hear me OK? I'm having a bit of a connectivity issue.
 -- 
Yes, loud and clear.
 -- 
OK. Great. I'm curious on international. The growth has actually slowed their profitability relative to U.S.
growth. And in some of the sales attrition, it seems like it's been more weighted toward folks in Australia, APAC more so than the U.S. relative to revenue split. So, any color you can provide there just on some of the slowdown in international?
 -- 
Yeah, do you want to speak to that, Rohan?
 -- 
Yeah, happy to. Rudy, candidly, not a whole lot to read into it. When you see the relative, I would say, the difference in growth rates between international and U.S., more often than not, the driver is timing of some of these larger Confluent platform deals. And I mean, Q2 was exactly the same.
We called out two large eight-figure deals. Both of the deals were in North America and hence, the delta, I would say, a relative difference in the growth rates. So, not a whole lot to call out. On the sales attrition, I'd say, again, no specific trends that we'd like to call out.
Just two comments I'll make on that front. First is, as we kind of went through the consumption transformation, obviously, as we stand right now reflecting back, we feel really good with the overall sales capacity we have on board. The first half of the year, we've had strong hiring from a sales organization perspective. And that just sets us well as we look ahead for rest of the year, I'd say we have the right capacity in place to deliver on our forecast.
 -- 
OK. And then secondly, just on the model. I know you guys are guiding to just total subscription revenue. It sounds like platform base is probably tough comparing second half versus first half and maybe down a bit in Q3.
Do I have that right? And secondly, on cloud revenue, just any directional color you can give on the sequential expectations in cloud? It sounds like it may be some of the headwinds in June and July, maybe the sequential add in Q3 is a bit lower than Q2?
 -- 
I lost you a little bit on the first part of your question, but I'll answer it. If it's not covered, let me know, right? Well, when we look at the second half guidance, I'll say I called out two drivers. The first is around Confluent platform. And in general, when you have these large deals, the timing of these deals matter.
And the timing of these deals, not only from a renewal perspective, but also from an expansion perspective. Renewals tend to be a lot more predictable than the expansions. And hence, my comment around the second half with respect to platform. On the Confluent Cloud side, again, what we are essentially modeling out is we're thinking that at the dynamics that we saw in the digital native customer segment will kind of continue into the second half.
So, yes, starting this quarter, we've obviously stopped guiding total revenue and the focus will be on subscription revenue. But just to help with the transition from an overall modeling point perspective, we expect cloud mix for the full year as a percentage of total subscription revenue to be approximately 53%, in that ZIP code. And that's very consistent with the mix that I shared earlier in the year. So, not a whole lot has changed, but I just wanted to provide that color as you think about the second half, Rudy.
 -- 
Yeah. That's helpful. And you have done both parts. Thank you.
You hit on both parts. Thank you.
 -- 
Thanks, Rudy. We'll take our next question from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research followed by Goldman.
 -- 
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. It's great to be on with you. I guess maybe just on the first one, on the digital natives, if you can kind of dig in a little bit there on maybe -- was the moderation in consumption or some of the, I would say, modulation of the green shoots, was that tied to a particular vertical, a particular geography? We heard Microsoft last night talk about how some consumption trends were less than they expected in Europe.
So, just curious if you could maybe categorize where some of those modulations came from?
 -- 
Yeah, there may be some geographical effect. I don't think that's the main thing. We actually saw this primarily in the larger set of digital native customers globally, right? So, U.S., EMEA, etc. And what is it that they're doing? It's not the case that they're cutting projects.
It's not the case that they're switching to competitors or there's any kind of customer loss in that segment. It really was about kind of optimizing their use of the underlying infrastructure. And so in a lot of these customers, they have a built-out team that's FinOps or something like that that's kind of scrutinizing costs and working with infrastructure teams to figure out, hey, can we consolidate clusters across teams? Can we compress data more? What can we do to kind of squeeze a little bit more juice out of each dollar of cloud spend is not unique to Confluent, but we did see a little bit more of that activity. Any quarter in that segment is a balance of that kind of optimization and expansion.
We think about last quarter, the balance was definitely on the expansion side. This quarter, a little bit more on the optimization side. That means when we think about the rest of the year, could play out either way, but we're factoring in more risk when we think about what we'll get out of that segment.
 -- 
Makes a ton of sense. And then maybe the second one, super helpful, by the way, on the cloud revenue component for the second half. But maybe like given the fact that you're signing more customers that you're landing maybe a little bit smaller initially, you've got a number of product vectors starting to gain traction with Flink and a few others. And then presumably, some of these GenAI use cases ramping, is there the possibility that even though the second half implied guidance for subscription for cloud, there is a bit of deceleration in that guide to account for the conservatism? How do we think about the sequencing of those tailwinds to maybe drive reacceleration? Again, I'll point to Microsoft, who told us second half of their fiscal year, they're going to see Azure reaccelerate.
 -- 
Yeah, I mean, obviously, we've kind of given the guidance for this year. It would be, I think, early to start describing next year. But just kind of broadly or qualitatively, as we add into that, yes, we feel like there's substantial tailwinds and all the things you just mentioned. I think we'll start to contribute more materially and that's definitely a positive factor for us.
And then when we just talk to customers, I think this is an area they continue to really bet on and invest in and that's increasingly for these larger customers becoming a very substantive part of their overall data infrastructure. So, I think, yes, that gives us a lot of confidence heading into next year about what the trajectory is.
 -- 
Perfect. Thank you, guys.
 -- 
Thanks, Alex. We'll take our next question from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs, followed by JPMorgan.
 -- 
Hey, thank you, guys. So, Jay, the motivation behind the transition to consumption was to ultimately get better growth rate acceleration, which was the right thing to do. So, as you are halfway through the mark of the year? What are the things that you've uncovered as unlocks, what are the things that are working, things that still need work? Because when you look at the -- if it were to accelerate, which I think is definitely the goal of the company and certainly the right thing, we should be starting to see some leading indicators get better. And maybe it's not the right way to look at the subscription revenue growth or the cloud revenue growth, which have been slowing down a bit, right? Maybe due to a whole host of all reasons.
While your lands are certainly very impressive. So, what needs to happen more for the transition to unlock the real growth potential of the company, which is the acceleration that you have planned for some time in calendar '25? And then I have a follow-up question. Thank you so much.
 -- 
Yeah. Yeah. I mean obviously, when we look at the performance every year, there's a number of factors in play, including just the fact that we're changing a lot of things in the go-to-market. The first step is kind of get back to where you were in the new system.
And I feel like, hey, we've kind of done that. It doesn't mean that everything is dramatically better, but it means we're now oriented around consumption, tracking each of the individual workloads in each customer, tracking the actual spend by component and the opportunities around that, which is what will drive the DSP growth. So, that's a good foundation to build on. So, what is it that we need to do? We need to really harness that and lean into it as the driver of growth.
And I think that will be a positive tailwind for us as we kind of head into next year, as well as all the customers we've landed. The nice thing is, hey, as we think about halfway into this year, we actually have a much broader base to grow out of in terms of new lands provided we're able to continue that throughout the second half of the year. Heading into next year, that's kind of a cohort to drive growth that will be kind of coming toward the more production maturity, additional use cases, etc., and that will be a tailwind.
 -- 
And one for Rohan. So, as you have the net expansion rates. I mean, certainly, they came down a bit. But broadly speaking, they're still OK relative to the overall growth rate of the company.
Does it mean that you could get more profitability because generating growth within the base is less costly, less time-consuming than going for growth outside? Or are there other puts and takes that offset that consideration, netting out on where you stand in terms of profitability, and could net expansion be a driver of better profitability?
 -- 
Yeah. I mean, Kash, thanks for your question. Higher net expansion rates and net retention rates are obviously a driver of leverage over a long period of time. So, there's no question about it.
I'll probably take the question in two lenses. First, when you double-click into net retention in addition to the current trends that you see, we spoke about data streaming platforms. And for customers that are using multi-products for us, their net retention rates are well above 130%. So, as you think about the next wave of growth, next vector of growth, that's going to be a tailwind to net retention rates.
So, that's one piece of it. The second piece of it, around the margin side. I mean when we think about our resource allocation philosophy, it is always making sure you get the right balance between growth and profitability and you're driving efficient growth over a long period of time. And that's our goal.
Given the opportunities that we have in 2025 and beyond with respect to the new growth vectors, we're being prudent about it. When you look at the second half, we'll be adding the right amount of capacity in engineering, in sales and marketing to make sure we are ready, and we are in the right position from an overall capacity perspective as we embark on next year. I mean, most of the hiring we're going to do between now and end of the year is going to benefit us next year. And I'll finish up by saying our medium-term goals from an operating margin perspective, which is in the ZIP code of 5% to 10%, continues to be the same.
And we're going to manage that proactively by balancing both growth and profitability.
 -- 
Thanks so much.
 -- 
Thank you. We'll take our next question from Pinjalim Bora with JPMorgan, followed by Oppenheimer.
 -- 
Great. Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the question. One question for you, I'll just blurt both of them out.
On the Flink market, as you try to kind of execute toward capturing the Flink opportunity, how does the maturity and kind of the understanding of the use cases compare to that of the core market? I'm trying to understand if you're finding customers that have well-defined Flink use cases and there's a pent-up demand versus the use cases are not as defined as that of the core Kafka market, and there's a little bit of evangelization that maybe needs to happen. That's the first question. And second question, how big is the digital native segment for you? Thank you.
 -- 
Yeah. I would think about Flink as being maybe as an open-source project, call it, maybe three years behind Kafka, broadly. And so in terms of maturity, that's probably where it is. Does that mean customers have use cases or don't have use cases as well? It depends on the customer, right? Typically, the way these technologies progress is from more technologically sophisticated companies to less technologically sophisticated companies.
And so in maybe some of the banks, digital native companies, they would have pretty mature Flink practices, maybe not as large scale as their Kafka usage, but certainly up and running. You get out further into mainstream enterprise, you'd see some of that, but maybe less, right? And so I would think about that as being kind of the vector of diffusion and very similar to Kafka usage. I think it follows a very similar pattern, but several years earlier in that flow. For us, I think the project is a lot easier than the initial Kafka land.
If you think about what we had to do getting into these new accounts with a cloud offering, especially early on, a lot of these customers did not have a lot of cloud products for infrastructure outside of the cloud provider. So, that kind of initial land was definitely the harder lift. As you think about, OK, great, now they've got these streams of data expansion to things that use the stream of data, I think it's definitely easier than kind of getting Kafka in the first time. And I think that's a positive for us for getting that product to ramp quickly.
And so we think that's a positive thing. And remind me of the second question you had?
 -- 
Just the size of digital natives for --
 -- 
Yeah. Yeah, we haven't broken that out. If we think about the business overall, it's not the largest kind of vertical. It's not even that well-defined kind of broadly in the industry, but we have a definition internally that we tag accounts with.
So, it's not the largest vertical for us, but it is sizable.
 -- 
Thank you.
 -- 
Thank you.
 -- 
We'll take our next question from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer, followed by Mizuho.
 -- 
Thanks, Jay. Rohan, first question to you. Can you tell me what percent of your platform revenue is associated with cloud customers as well? I'm just trying to think because if there's a significant overlap there, I would think that over time, the inherent lumpiness in platform would fade. So, we'll love to get color on that.
 -- 
Yeah, that's a great question. Well, we've not broken that out, but what I can tell you is there is increasing set of customers who are using both Platform and Confluent Cloud. And a couple of quarters back, we've been kind of also providing updates that when customers have both Cloud and Platform, they tend to be more sticky and their NRRs are higher than the company average NRRs as well. So, that's one piece of it.
But your other point around -- if you have both Platform and Cloud, the lumpiness will come down. Probably not always because most of these times, you do have complementary use cases that are working in parallel. So, when a time for a platform renewal actually comes, there is an event that happens that drives upfront revenue recognition. That doesn't change.
So, the lumpiness will still be there. But I think to answer your question, yes, there is a growing number of customers that are using both Platform and Cloud. And actually, that's exactly the direction we want to go because that makes our customers a lot more stickier.
 -- 
And Jay, second question for you. You've talked about how the quality of the new customer additions is higher. Maybe you can dig into that a little bit more, what does that mean? Is this a Global 2000 customers more weighted? Any color on that would be great.
 -- 
Yeah. It's not exactly Global 2000. We have a couple of mechanisms that we include in that, but it would be broadly aligned to something like that. We would also include certain types of tech customers that might not be Global 2000 but have high potential.
So, it's a defined customer list that we've set aside. So, it's something like that, where we feel like, hey, there's potential for high IT spend and therefore, kind of bigger growth for us over time.
 -- 
Yeah, I appreciate it.
 -- 
Thanks.
 -- 
We'll take our next question from Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho, followed by Needham.
 -- 
OK. Thank you. Rohan, you did a nice job explaining some of the deliberation by the digital native customers and what you're assuming going forward. That said, you beat Q2 subscription revenue by about $7 million, guided in line for Q3, which implies a fairly meaningful Q4 reduction.
So, I did just want to ask if either of these large deals closed sooner than you had expected? Or if there's anything you're seeing in the pipeline that has caused you to be a little more cautious with respect to the Q4 specifically?
 -- 
Yeah, Gregg, I'll say that I'll go back to like when we think about the second half guidance, obviously, these two drivers that I spoke about on the Confluent Platform side. In general, you have Confluent Platform, large deals that are either renewals and expansions and new deals. For the renewals, it's fairly predictable. You have visibility 12 months down the road when that's going to happen.
And more often than not, it ends up kind of in that ZIP code. For the newer deals and for the expansion deals, that's where you could see deals kind of shift one quarter plus/minus. And that's the dynamic that basically I called out for the second half guidance. And it's also important to note is that our backdrop of what continues to be a fairly volatile macro environment.
And we want to make sure that we are thoughtful and prudent with respect to as we think about the outlook. On the Confluent Cloud side, again, not a whole lot of new things to share but we are basically assuming that the dynamics that we saw toward the end of Q2 will kind of have an impact to the second half of the year.
 -- 
And then just for Jay, can you walk through the rationale of switching Confluent Cloud pricing for your basic and standard clusters based on partitions previously to elastic SKUs? And then also, does this change have any impact on revenue over the remainder of '24?
 -- 
Yeah. We made a set of pricing changes. Those were some of them. There was also some tune-ups on some of the throughput-related pricing, some of the connector pricing.
We talked a little bit about that a few earnings back as being kind of aligned with this consumption transformation. So, in general, we were looking at things, that cost friction early in the buying process, and we're kind of more aligned to a big upfront purchase than they were to a kind of use case by use case expansion and we wanted to pull some of that out. If you think about what we're trying to do broadly, there's a lot of open-source Kafka usage out there. We've monetized a small percentage of it, mostly sitting out there and open-source, we want to go get it.
There's a bunch of things we do to make that happen. But part of what we want to do is really cover the spectrum of kind of TCO needs. There are very high volume, very price-sensitive workloads. There's very premium, high-quality workloads.
You actually need some different SKUs to actually segment that market and go after it in the best way. So, if you think about the additions to our portfolio, both the new offerings in Kafka for very large scale, some of the tuning at the low end, it really is about trying to properly segment that market and go capture it to kind of soak up more of the world's Kafka, I think has proven successful in part, as evidenced by the higher volume of customer lands, I mean part of that kind of comp and sales practice thing, but part of it is also changes in the product that make it easier to land. Does it have impact on revenue? Yes, it does have some. Whenever any of these things that kind of give customers more options, it does give them more opportunity to shift around.
When we look at that, that effectively came out as expected. So, we had some model of like, hey, how much shift are we going to see. Typically, what you see when you make one of these changes is initially, some shift that may be a little bit negative. And then kind of better expansion as you have more options for customers to plug into.
And so when we were checking ourselves against the model we built in terms of the impact of that, it was more or less exactly what we expected. When you take it all together, of course, individual changes might be a little bit more or less. So, the change on those SKUs was kind of a part of that larger vision, which is like simplification, friction reduction, and just kind of soaking up all the Kafka. Is that helpful?
 -- 
Yeah, super helpful. Thank you.
 -- 
And Gregg, I'll just add to what Jay said that is, as we look at the second half of the year, some of these dynamics that we called out is essentially baked into our outlook for the year as well.
 -- 
All right. Thank you, guys.
 -- 
Thanks. Let's go to Mike Cikos with Needham. Mike?
 -- 
Hey thanks for taking the question guys. Before I dig into mine, just to make sure we're clear on where we were going with Gregg's last question there. As far as those pricing changes, that was contemplated when you guys provided us the guide for the full year two quarters ago? Or no, we're making changes now in real time off the Q2 result?
 -- 
Yeah. Yeah. I think it was factored in early on. Like we had a model for what impact that would have, and we haven't seen it deviate from that.
So, when we think about like, hey, what are the factors impacting guidance in the second half? I think it's exactly what Rohan said, which is Confluent Platform lumpiness and what we've seen in the digital native segment. The price changes, we think it's net positive over time, but it's not a huge factor one way or the other right now.
 -- 
Awesome. Awesome. So, I wanted to start with -- I know the digital natives, we've highlighted that a lot. Is there any way to think about how their spend compares to other pieces or other segments within the Confluent customer base? Is it a 2x -- what's the significance of the spend on a per customer basis versus the rest of the Confluent customer base?
 -- 
Yeah. Digital native itself spans from very small kind of tech companies to very large tech organizations with thousands of engineers. And so it would be inaccurate to characterize that as a whole. So, even internally, we break that into kind of large tech companies and smaller tech companies.
What we saw was more concentrated on these large tech companies that are kind of more actively pursuing optimization. For those large customers, yes, they do tend to operate at scale. They have a lot of engineers. They tend to move quicker than the average customer in terms of adoption and expansion, but also in terms of optimization, they're just a little bit more agile than a similarly sized company elsewhere in enterprise.
That's probably broadly how I would characterize it. Their kind of use cases aren't vastly different from the rest of the world. They just tend to have a bit more data and somewhat more engineers than the average company that size.
 -- 
OK. And just thinking about the quality of the logos that we've highlighted a couple of times here as well. We're early days here, but is there any way to think about how the expansion of these new logos has played out versus what you've seen historically? And I guess the second part here, for those new logos, does it skew more heavily toward digital natives? Or is there any way to think about the composition of these new logos?
 -- 
What we've shared is it's kind of broadly more concentrated in that high propensity customer list, which you think of as kind of Global 2000 plus high propensity tech. I haven't looked at the tech composition specifically broken out, so I couldn't give you more color on that, but I'm not aware of that being a factor. And then yes, we are catching these use cases earlier. It's just easier in this consumption motion for us to land.
We're more flexible on the commitment amount. The product is better optimized for that. The comp is incentivizing it. And so yes, it is easier for us to get in early.
But the key thing for us will be to kind of show that ramp of consumption over the course of the year with these new customers. What we've seen so far is promising, both in terms of the numbers and that ramp time. I don't think it will be exactly the same amount per customer, but the customer volume is much higher. And so we think, overall, that's a net positive contributor when we think about what the base of new customers that we're acquiring.
 -- 
Thanks.
 -- 
Our final question today will come from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo.
 -- 
Shane, thanks for squeezing me on. Jay, between the go-to-market changes and the new product efforts, it seems like you're setting the stage for the next phase of Confluent. When do you think the foundation there is largely set and we go past talking about some of the transition impacts and more directly to some of the benefits from consumption focus and new products? Is that something we can start to build toward today? Is that end of the year?
 -- 
I mean, obviously, there's no moment in time where yesterday, it was the old thing. And today, it's the new thing. But yes, it's certainly the case that this year, we've got a lot of moving parts that are part of kind of setting up where we want to get to, right? The consumption changes are part of that. The new product introductions are part of that.
As it becomes more of a tailwind for the business, I think it's definitely as we head into next year, that's where we have a more stable system that we're executing the go-to-market and we've had more history with. And then we have products that have kind of gotten to enough scale of revenue where they can move the overall number. Obviously, these newer offerings, you invest a lot of time in them, but the early results you're just building that initial customer base. It's relative to the amount of effort, you're not getting as much dollars out as you would with the core business.
However, any of the big things start small. And so kind of getting those things seeded and started now, I think, is very important, both in terms of what we want the business to do over the course of the next three years, but also in terms of what we want to be in customers like the capabilities we want to provide them, setting ourselves up to really be a strategic platform in these organizations. So, yes, obviously, that's a key effort this year. I would think about the contribution as being throughout next year and kind of a tailwind then.
 -- 
Thanks very much.

Thanks, Michael. [Operator signoff]

Meta beats Q2 expectations but warns of 'significant' spending expansion in 2025 2024-07-31T20:15:32.000Z

Facebook and Instagram parent Meta (
) reported its 
 after the bell on Wednesday, beating Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom lines. But the company warned it expects to see "significant" capital expenditures growth in 2025.
"While we do not intend to provide any quantitative guidance for 2025 until the fourth quarter call, we expect infrastructure costs will be a significant driver of expense growth next year as we recognize depreciation and operating costs associated with our expanded infrastructure footprint," CFO Susan Li said in a statement.
AI spending is a key measure for Wall Street as investors anxiously await a return on Big Tech’s investments in the technology. During its prior quarter, Li raised the company’s full-year total expense estimate from between 
.
For the second quarter, Meta saw earnings per share (EPS) of $5.16 on revenue of $39.07 billion. Analysts were expecting EPS of $4.74 on revenue of $38.3 billion, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Meta recorded EPS of $2.98 on revenue of $31.9 billion during the same period last year.
The company’s Family of Apps revenue, which includes revenue from Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, clocked in at $38.72 billion, higher than estimates of $37.7 billion. Meta saw revenue of $31.7 billion in the segment in Q2 last year.
Meta stock climbed more than 4% following the report.
Beyond its advertising revenue, Wall Street is still trying to determine how much longer Meta will need to plow money into AI before it sees some kind of revenue payoff.
Last week, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Meta’s latest open-source large language model (LLM) called Llama 3.1. What’s more, the Facebook founder said the industry should focus on open-source AI rather than closed-source models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT.
Meta’s Reality Labs segment, which includes its mixed reality hardware and software, saw revenue of $353 million in the quarter versus expectations of $376 million. That's better than the company reported in the same quarter last year, but the segment continues to hemorrhage cash.
In Q2, Meta reported that the segment lost some $4.49 billion, slightly below expectations of $4.53 billion. It lost $3.8 billion in Q1. The division has also been plagued by turnover and a lack of clear vision, adding to Reality Labs’ troubles,

Qualcomm is undergoing 'a natural recovery': Strategist 2024-07-31T21:19:15.000Z

Qualcomm (

 while also providing an improved outlook. Brian Colello, Morningstar equity strategist, shares his analysis of the report on Market Domination Overtime.
Colello describes this as "a natural recovery for Qualcomm," noting that the situation couldn't have been worse than it was at the end of 2022 and early 2023 for the company. He sees positive developments across all segments, with even the automotive division outperforming expectations. Regarding the PC market recovery, Colello cautions that it's "a multi-year story," but points out that smartphone-related business is already showing signs of improvement.
Colello highlights Qualcomm's expansion into other sectors as electrification continues across various industries. "I think it makes sense for Qualcomm to be taking its smartphone processor expertise and moving into new markets. PC is one, automotive is another," he explains. "We're seeing electrification of the car, more and more processing power in the car, and that is going to be a multi-year, multi-decade trend. So Qualcomm is going to be in that mix."

Meta says India is the largest market for Meta AI usage 2024-08-01T03:12:44.000Z

WhatsApp's massive 500 million users in India have supercharged Meta's AI ambitions.
Meta CFO Susan Li said Wednesday that India is the largest market in terms of Meta AI usage, a notable milestone considering the product launched in India just a few months ago.
Li said during Meta's second-quarter earnings call that people have used Meta AI for billions of queries since its launch.
"We're seeing particularly promising signs on WhatsApp in terms of retention and engagement, which has coincided with India becoming our largest market for Meta AI usage," she noted.
Meta first launched Meta AI, which is present across Instagram, Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp and the web, in 
. The company upgraded the chatbot in April with the new Llama 3 model and 
 in more than a dozen countries.
While Meta started testing 
, it wasn't 
, after India's general elections were completed.
The company has faced cultural challenges in making AI more attuned to the Indian market. In May, TechCrunch reported that 
. In July, several users on X complained that 
. These results were inconsistent, and in the end Meta tweaked its algorithm to create a level playing field for religious jokes.
 Meta AI is now available in 22 countries, including the recent additions of Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Mexico.
