Owning 45% shares,institutional owners seem interested in Alumina Limited (ASX:AWC), 2023-12-24T22:02:50.000Z

A look at the shareholders of Alumina Limited (ASX:AWC) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 45% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).
Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.
Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Alumina, beginning with the chart below.
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Alumina. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Alumina's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Alumina. Orbis Investment Management Limited is currently the company's largest shareholder with 19% of shares outstanding. CITIC Resources Holdings Limited is the second largest shareholder owning 9.6% of common stock, and CITIC Group Corporation holds about 9.3% of the company stock.
Our research also brought to light the fact that roughly 51% of the company is controlled by the top 5 shareholders suggesting that these owners wield significant influence on the business.
Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.
I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.
Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Alumina Limited. But they may have an indirect interest through a corporate structure that we haven't picked up on. It is a pretty big company, so it would be possible for board members to own a meaningful interest in the company, without owning much of a proportional interest. In this case, they own around AU$3.0m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.
The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 36% stake in Alumina. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.
It seems that Private Companies own 9.3%, of the Alumina stock. It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company.
We can see that public companies hold 9.6% of the Alumina shares on issue. We can't be certain but it is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together.
I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered

Alcoa Corporation (NYSE:AA) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript 2024-01-19T13:53:19.000Z

Alcoa Corporation (NYSE:
) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript January 17, 2024
Alcoa Corporation beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $-0.56, expectations were $-0.99. AA isn't one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (
).
 Good afternoon, and welcome to the Alcoa Corporation Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Presentation and Conference Call. All participant will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation there will be an opportunity to ask question. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today’s event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to James Dwyer, Vice President, Investor Relations and Pension Investments. Please go ahead.
 Thank you, and good day, everyone. I'm joined today by William Oplinger, Alcoa Corporation President and Chief Executive Officer; and Molly Beerman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions after comments by Bill and Molly. As a reminder, today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations that are subject to various assumptions and caveats. Factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in today's presentation and in our SEC filings. In addition, we have included some non-GAAP financial measures in this presentation. For historical non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the appendix to today's presentation.
We have not presented quantitative reconciliations of certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures for reasons noted on this slide. Any reference in our discussion today to EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA. Finally, as previously announced, the earnings press release and slide presentation are available on our website. With that, here's Bill.
 Thanks, Jim, and welcome, everyone, to our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. Today, we'll review the substantial progress we've made in the fourth quarter on key objectives, the financial results, the market and our plans to continue to improve and strengthen our company. I started last quarter's call by affirming the areas of Alcoa's near-term focus and reinforcing our values to act with integrity, operate with excellence, care for people and lead with courage. Consistent with those values, I'm proud that Alcoa's safety performance showed marked improvement in 2023. While we experienced two FSI-As last year, we improved year-over-year in all key safety metrics. We intend to continue our progress toward our goal of an injury-free workplace.
Safety performance is important for another reason too. It's a key indicator of the stability and quality of our operations. Excellent safety performance goes hand-in-hand with operational excellence. I'm not surprised then, given our strong safety performance, we set production records at our three smelters in Canada and one in Norway, and we are also successfully restarting one potline at Warrick here in the States. We made great progress on other focus areas too. We achieved, what I said was our most important objective, gaining approvals for our bauxite mines in Western Australia. With these approvals, we now have a clear path forward for continued operation in Western Australia. Also in WA, we recently announced the curtailment of the 60-year-old Kwinana refinery, starting in the second quarter of this year.
The decision was based on a variety of factors, including Kwinana's age, scale, operating costs and current bauxite grades, in addition to current market conditions. In December, we began engagement with the national and regional authorities in Spain, as well as the labor works council to discuss ongoing financial losses at the San Ciprian refinery and smelter. We are considering all forms of relief, while working collaboratively on a long-term solution for the complex. With that, let me turn it over to Molly to go over the financials.
 Thank you, Bill. Revenue was flat sequentially at $2.6 billion as lower shipments for both Alumina and Aluminum more than offset higher aluminum realized price. The net loss attributable to Alcoa improved $18 million to $150 million, and the loss per share improved from $0.94 to $0.84. On an adjusted basis, the net loss attributable to Alcoa was $100 million or $0.56. The difference is primarily related to the recording of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in Brazil, net of non-controlling interest. Adjusted EBITDA increased $19 million to $89 million. For the full-year 2023, year-over-year revenues decreased $1.9 billion to $10.6 billion and net loss attributable to Alcoa worsened $528 million to a loss of $651 million, or $3.65 per share.
Adjusted net income changed from $869 million in 2022 to a loss of $405 million in 2023, or $2.27 per share. And adjusted EBITDA, excluding special items, moved from $2.2 billion to $536 million. Let's look at the key drivers of EBITDA. Fourth quarter 2023 adjusted EBITDA increased as improved raw material costs and shipment volumes offset energy and price-mix challenges. In addition, favorable production costs, including recognition of the full-year benefit for Section 45X of the Inflation Reduction Act at Warrick and Massena more than offset higher other expenses. Alumina segment EBITDA increased $31 million sequentially, primarily on lower raw material costs and lower production costs in Brazil and Australia. We also saw a substantial benefit from lower raw material costs in the Aluminum segment, which combined with favorable production costs, primarily 45X, to offset the impact of higher energy costs and lower value-add product premiums.
The higher energy costs included a second year of unfavorable legislative changes in Norway's CO2 compensation arrangement. Outside the segments, transformation demolition costs were lower, but inter-segment eliminations and other corporate costs were unfavorable. Let's look at cash movements within the fourth quarter on the next slide. The cash balance increased $18 million in the quarter to $944 million. The largest source of cash was working capital reduction of $222 million, which more than offset the largest use of cash, capital expenditures at $188 million, higher EBITDA of $89 million, various other items totaling $97 million and net non-controlling interest contributions of $18 million, mostly offset all other uses of cash. Moving on to other key financial metrics.
Our key financial metrics are consistent with our earnings results. Full-year 2023 return-on-equity was negative 8.9%. Our fourth quarter dividend added $18 million to stockholder capital returns, which totaled $72 million for the year. While free cash flow plus net non-controlling interest contributions was negative for the year at $282 million, it was positive $28 million in the fourth quarter. Proportional adjusted net debt increased by $0.1 billion due to fourth quarter pension and OPEB plan re-measurements. In both the fourth quarter and full-year 2023, capital expenditures and cash income taxes were our largest uses of cash. Days working capital improved 11 days to 39 days year-over-year, primarily on decreases in inventories of $243 million.
Sequential improvement, also 11 days, was driven primarily by the typical increase in year-end payables, while reducing inventory values further. The improved working capital performance provided a significant source of cash in the fourth quarter, resulting in a full-year working capital source of cash of $221 million. Let's turn to the outlook in the first quarter and the full-year 2024. For 2024, we have included an outlook for both production and shipments for the segments. We expect Alumina production to range between 9.8 million and 10.0 million tons and shipments to range between 12.7 million and 12.9 million tons. The difference reflects our normal trading volumes, as well as externally sourced alumina to cover the customer contracts previously fulfilled by Kwinana production.
The Aluminum segment is expected to produce between 2.2 million and 2.3 million tons, increasing on smelter restarts, while shipments hold steady between 2.5 million and 2.6 million tons due to lower projected trading volumes. In EBITDA items outside the segments, we expect transformation cost to remain at $80 million and other corporate expense to improve to $120 million, reflecting a portion of our efforts in productivity and competitiveness programs. Below EBITDA, we expect depreciation to increase to $675 million, primarily due to additional assets placed in service as well as increases in the assets related to asset retirement obligations from mine reclamation and bauxite residue storage. Non-operating pension and OPEB expense is expected to be flat at $15 million and interest expense will be comparable to 2023's level at $110 million.
For cash flow impacts, we expect 2024 pension and OPEB required cash funding to be similar to 2023 at $70 million. The majority of that spend is U.S. OPEB. Our capital returns to stockholders will continue to be aligned with our capital allocation framework. Our current capital expenditure estimate is $550 million, with $90 million in return-seeking and $460 million in sustaining capital. Approximately 65% of the total CapEx is within the Alumina segment, where 40% is funded by our JV partner. Looking ahead to 2025 and 2026, we expect CapEx to increase approximately $50 million to about $600 million, primarily related to mine moves. We expect approximately $130 million lower prior period income tax payments in 2024, down to $50 million. Environmental and ARO spending is expected to increase to approximately $295 million, approximately $20 million related to accelerated mine rehabilitation in both Australia and Brazil.
We also expect higher spending at Kwinana and residue area closures and regulatory requirements in Brazil, and more spend is projected for demolition and remediation at previously closed sites in 2024 as we prepare those properties for future redevelopment. While we do not provide guidance on full-year cash restructuring charges, we did provide the estimates for the Kwinana curtailment in our January 8th announcement. Of Alcoa's share of related cash outlays, approximately $80 million are expected to be spent in 2024 and approximately $35 million in 2025. Our JV partner, Alumina Limited will cover the remaining 40% of those costs or approximately $65 million. To provide flexibility to implement our portfolio actions, today we executed an amendment to our revolving credit facility agreement, which includes adjusting covenant limits for the 2024 fiscal year.
Looking at the first quarter. In the Alumina segment, we expect approximately $15 million unfavorable impacts related to higher maintenance costs and lower volume in Australia. In addition, we expect benefits from lower raw materials and energy costs to be fully offset by other factors. In Aluminum, we expect multiple factors to fully offset, including favorable energy impacts, primarily due to lower prices in Brazil and Norway, lower product premiums and unfavorable net impact from the non-recurrence of fourth quarter 2023 one-time items. Alumina costs and the Aluminum segment are expected to be unfavorable by $5 million. Additionally, we expect a one-time unfavorable impact of approximately $20 million, as the hedge programs for the Alumar smelter restart ended in December 2023.
Below EBITDA, note that fourth quarter other expenses included one-time positive impacts of $51 million, primarily foreign currency gains. Based on recent pricing, we expect first quarter 2024 operational tax expense to be negligible. Now, I will turn it back to Bill.
 Thanks, Molly. Now let's discuss our markets. In Alumina, prices rallied at the end of the fourth quarter, driven by announced Chinese refinery curtailments due to a domestic bauxite shortage and concerns about Guinea bauxite supply, and have continued to increase in January. We expect the market to be short in 2024 with steady demand from smelters and little inventory available. In Aluminum, for 2024, we expect the balance to slight surplus market, depending on the speed of demand recovery during the year. On the supply side, there are few announced restarts or new projects and China has held to its 45 million ton capacity cap. In addition, hydro power shortages caused 1.2 million tons of capacity to be curtailed in Yunnan province last November.
Demand has stabilized in North America and Europe, and we see the potential for a moderate recovery throughout the year. Regional premiums are increasing due to both the widening contango and higher transportation costs to import metal. In our order book, value add product orders are stabilizing and premiums appear to be firming up. While lower than their peaks, that premiums remain above historical levels. In China, we expect government stimulus programs to prompt demand growth as those measures take effect. Globally, growth in aluminum-intensive EVs and renewable power infrastructure will continue to support this positive trend. We also see demand improving in packaging as inventory destocking has been largely accomplished. And finally, on a concerning note, we have seen the share of Russian metal stocks on the LME stocks 90% in December.
Because LME stocks are now predominantly Russian origin metal, which is unwanted by much of the world, subject to a 200% tariff in the U.S. and now legally prohibited in the U.K., it is difficult to have confidence that the LME exchange price matches the true physical price for non-Russian aluminum. In December, we joined others within European Aluminium to call on the EU to progress sanctions against Russia, and specifically, to include aluminum primary metal, which remains outside of the scope of the measures currently agreed to by the EU. Now, let's turn our focus from the market to Alcoa and our actions to improve profitability. This slide describes factors that can improve our financial performance over 2023's results. As you can see from the chart, we have significant upside potential to adjusted EBITDA.
We divide the improvement drivers into three categories: near-term actions; medium-term opportunities; and market improvement. Near-term actions are underway and have the most well-defined financial impacts. The largest area of impact is our $310 million estimate of raw material savings for 2024, including for key raw materials like caustic soda and lime for refining and anode carbon products for smelting. Thanks to our procurement team's actions as well as pricing and inventory lags, roughly one-third of that amount is already fully realizable, and the remainder is conservatively estimated using current market pricing. Next, we are targeting $100 million benefit from our program to reduce controllable operating costs across our organization.
Outside of raw materials, energy and transportation, which are already under active management. Recently initiated full run-rate savings are expected to be achieved by the first quarter of 2025. This overarching program includes general belt tightening, as well as efforts such as our workforce blueprint, in which we benchmark our operations internally and externally and set an aggressive best-in-class goals for each operation. Three additional components of our near-term actions are: the Warrick smelter optimization and potline restart, with the benefit of additional IRA funding at both Warrick and Massena; completing the Alumar smelter restart and realizing savings from the Kwinana curtailment. All of these locations are fully mobilized and working toward achieving the savings targets.
As mentioned earlier, last month, we started discussions with union and government stakeholders on finding a long-term solution for the San Ciprian smelter and refinery. In late 2021, with the support of our employees, local communities and government, we started down a path that aimed at positioning the San Ciprian complex for long-term economic viability. To accomplish that goal, Alcoa invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the operations and supporting employees, their families and the local economy. While operations continue to be restricted to 50% at the refinery and are fully curtailed at the smelter, 2023 EBITDA losses were over $150 million across the San Ciprian complex. Despite our collective efforts, we've clearly fallen far short of our goal of achieving economic viability for San Ciprian.
Looking-forward into 2024, the San Ciprian complex is expected to incur substantial losses, even with the recent improvements in energy markets and the aluminum price. If the situation does not change significantly in the months ahead, we anticipate that available funding will be exhausted in the second-half of 2024. If that happens, we will have no choice but to make hard decisions that will adversely and potentially irrevocably impact employment and the economy in Galicia more broadly. Nobody wants that. But absent significant change, that is exactly what will happen. That is why we are urgently advancing our engagement efforts with employees and governments to begin defining options. For its part, Alcoa intends to continue to honor the spirit of the commitments it made in the viability agreement.
However, we will need flexibility from our unions and significant support from the regional and national governments. Medium-term opportunities and market improvements are the other two drivers of adjusted EBITDA improvement potential. Medium-term opportunities are beyond 2024 and 2025, but achievable in the next several years. An example is benefiting from better bauxite grades in Australia after upcoming mine moves. When it comes to market impacts, we are a commodity business. A large part of adjusted EBITDA potential correlates to market improvement. As an example, comparing more favorable 2022 metal and alumina prices to 2023 prices reveals massive potential for EBITDA improvement, especially in the metals segment should prices increase.
We have demonstrated the ability to profit from favorable market conditions when they arise. Finally, we have not included here the potential we see from breakthrough R&D technologies, including ELYSIS, because they are longer-term. We do not anticipate significant capital expenditures for ELYSIS before the end of the decade, although the continued ramp-up of the R&D work will produce additional volume of ELYSIS metal for the partners, including Alcoa, to bring to-market. For the quarter, I'm very proud that we have remained true to our values, including improving on both safety and operational performance. While profit metrics improved slightly on a sequential basis, we are aiming to improve substantially from where we are today. And on that front, we have made important and impactful progress on our key challenges.
Going forward, we are working to maintain positive momentum in Western Australia and continue to build toward a long-term solution for our San Ciprian complex in Spain. Our entire organization is focused on delivering near-term actions and company-wide productivity and competitiveness programs. We believe that not only is the medium and long-term outlook for aluminum strong, but 2024 starting to look like a positive turning point. With that, operator, what questions do we have in the queue?

UPDATE 2-US aluminium maker Alcoa makes $2.2 bln offer for Australia's Alumina 2024-02-25T23:23:11.000Z

(Recasts, updates throughout with more details, background, adds quote)
By Echha Jain and Melanie Burton
MELBOURNE, Feb 26 (Reuters) - U.S. aluminium producer Alcoa Corp on Monday made a non-binding, conditional buyout proposal for its Australian joint venture partner Alumina , valuing the company at $2.2 billion in an all-stock offer.
The deal raises exposure for the major aluminium maker in the upstream business of aluminium and simplifies governance for both parties. Alumina shareholders will also get exposure to the finished product aluminium in a bigger company.
“To a very large degree it simplifies the corporate structure,” said portfolio manager Simon Mahwhinny of Allan Gray, adding that for that reason it offers the same or more upside for both sets of shareholders. Allan Gray Australia holds just under 20% of Alumina's stock which it has agreed to sell to Alcoa, the parties said in a joint statement.
Under the deal, Alumina shareholders would receive 0.02854 shares of Alcoa common stock for each share held. This would imply a value of A$1.15 per Alumina share, based on Alcoa’s closing price as of February 23.
Alumina's Managing Director and CEO Michael Ferraro intends to recommend shareholders vote in the favour of the proposal, in the absence of a superior proposal, it said.
Alumina's board also noted that there is no certainty that the proposal would result in a binding takeover offer for the company.
Alumina and Alcoa jointly own Kwinana Alumina Refinery in Western Australia. Alcoa said in January it
planned
to stop production in 2024 at the loss-making refinery due to challenging market conditions and the facility's age.
Shares of Alumina had jumped as much as 8.8% to A$1.110 as at 2318 GMT, their biggest intraday gain since Jan 10. (Reporting by Echha Jain in Bengaluru; additional reporting by Melanie Burton in Melbourne; editing by Diane Craft)

Alcoa aims to take out Australian partner Alumina in $2.2 billion deal 2024-02-26T11:09:17.000Z

By Melanie Burton and Echha Jain
MELBOURNE (Reuters) -U.S. aluminium producer Alcoa on Monday made a $2.2 billion all-stock buyout proposal for its Australian joint venture partner Alumina, in a deal that would give it greater upstream exposure and simplify its operations.
Alumina's only asset is a 40% stake in the Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals (AWAC) joint venture, which is controlled by Alcoa and has interests in bauxite mining, alumina refining and aluminium smelting across Australia, Brazil, Spain, Saudi Arabia and Guinea.
Alcoa CEO William Oplinger told analysts the deal would eliminate Alumina's A$12 million ($7.87 million) a year of overhead costs and allow the combined company to tap tax advantages related to holding debt.
The broader global footprint will also allow Alcoa more options for growth, he added.
Under the proposed deal, Alumina shareholders would receive 0.02854 shares of Alcoa common stock for each share held, giving them a 31% stake in the combined company. This would imply a value of A$1.15 per Alumina share, based on Alcoa's closing price as of Friday.
Alumina shares closed 7 Australian cents higher at A$1.09 on Monday. Alcoa's shares were down 2.9% in U.S. premarket trading.
Melbourne-based Alumina said its board backed the deal in the absence of a superior offer, though it also noted there was no certainty the proposal would be made binding.
Alumina's largest shareholder, investment manager Allan Gray Australia, holds just under a 20% stake in the company, which it said it had agreed to sell to Alcoa.
"To a very large degree it simplifies the corporate structure," portfolio manager Simon Mahwhinny of Allan Gray said of the deal.
Alumina was created from a 2002 de-merger of WMC Ltd's alumina assets and an Alcoa buyout has been viewed as logical by analysts for more than two decades.
AWAC also has a 55% interest in the Portland aluminum smelter in Australia with China's CITIC Resources and Japan's Marubeni.
CITIC Resources and other subsidiaries of its parent CITIC Ltd hold a combined 19% stake in Alumina, according to CITIC Resources' 2023 interim report, making the Chinese group the second-largest shareholder. CITIC did not respond immediately for a request for comment on whether it backed the Alcoa offer.
"We believe this transaction makes strategic sense, but the economic upside to Alcoa is offset by the premium paid," Jefferies analysts in a note on Alcoa.
"We would expect shareholders of both companies to vote for this transaction, although this is not certain as AWC shareholders may be disappointed by the relatively small premium in an all-share deal."
The deal offered a 13% premium to Alumina's last closing price, below more typical takeover premiums of about 30%.
The Alcoa proposal comes at a tough time in the alumina industry due to low prices.
Alcoa said in January it planned to stop production this year at AWAC's loss-making Kwinana alumina refinery in Western Australia due to challenging market conditions and the facility's age.

UPDATE 3-Alcoa to buy Australian partner Alumina in $2.2 bln all-stock deal 2024-03-12T03:06:44.000Z

Alumina stock one of the top gainers on AXJO
(Rewrites throughout, updates with further details, shares and analyst reaction)
By Roushni Nair and Rishav Chatterjee
March 12 (Reuters) - Alcoa will buy Alumina in an all-stock deal that values the Australian firm at $2.2 billion, and makes the U.S. company one of the world's largest producers of alumina and bauxite.
Shares of Alumina rose as much as 10.4% after Alcoa announced the deal on Monday, hitting their highest since August 2023. Alcoa shares gained 2.1% to $30.5 apiece.
Alcoa's push for acquiring its joint venture partner can be seen as a gamble for metals which will be an important part of the transition to cleaner sources of energy.
Buying Alumina gives Alcoa full control of their joint venture, which is one of the world's largest producers of the semi-processed form of aluminium. Aluminium is used to produce renewable infrastructure and electric vehicles.
The global mining sector has seen a recent slew of merger and acquisitions despite rising concerns around the economic outlook of one of the world's largest metals buyer, China, and slowing EV sales in the United States.
"It could be a win-win for both companies," Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at trading firm KCM Trade, said.
"The takeover offer could be viewed as a vote of confidence in the resources space despite a cloudy growth outlook for the sector."
The buyout follows United States Steel's $14.9 billion deal to buy Japan's Nippon Steel and Newmont's $15 billion acquisition of Aussie gold miner Newcrest.
Post the deal, Alumina shareholders will own about 31.6% of the merged entity, while Alcoa shareholders will hold 68.4%.
Alumina's board, including Managing Director and CEO, recommended shareholders vote for the deal, in the absence of a superior proposal.
The deal comes months after Alcoa faced operational and permit-realted problems for its bauxite business in Australia. It also disclosed in January plans to halt production at the Kwinana alumina plant in Western Australia in a move to control costs.

Alumina Limited's (ASX:AWC) Intrinsic Value Is Potentially 78% Above Its Share Price 2024-03-13T05:58:45.000Z

Does the March share price for Alumina Limited (
) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.
We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the 
.
We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:
 = US$965m
The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.5%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$365m× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.5%– 2.2%) = US$7.0b
= TV / (1 + r)
= US$7.0b÷ ( 1 + 7.5%)
= US$3.4b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$4.3b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of AU$1.3, the company appears quite undervalued at a 44% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.
The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Alumina as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.165. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For Alumina, there are three essential factors you should assess:

Alcoa (AA) Inks Definitive Deal to Acquire Alumina for $2.2B 2024-03-14T13:10:00.000Z

 AA recently finalized a binding Scheme Implementation Deed ("Agreement") to acquire Alumina Limited in an all-scrip or all-stock transaction. The agreement, first announced in February, is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2024.
Headquartered in Southbank, Victoria, Australia, Alumina invests in bauxite mining, alumina refining and aluminum smelting operations primarily in Australia, Brazil and Spain.
This latest deal highlights the strength of Alcoa’s long-standing partnership with Alumina. Both companies have collaborated as joint venture partners in a refining and smelting business, Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals (“AWAC”), which operates across multiple countries.
Per the agreed terms, Alumina shareholders will be entitled to receive 0.02854 shares of Alcoa for each share of Alumina, a ratio implying an equity value of about $2.2 billion for Alumina. This distribution will offer Alumina shareholders with an ownership stake of 31.25% in the combined company, while the remaining 68.75% of the stake will be owned by Alcoa shareholders.
Alumina shareholders will obtain Alcoa shares in CHESS Depositary Interests form, which will facilitate them in trading Alcoa shares on the Australian Stock Exchange for a minimum of 10 years.
Alcoa believes this acquisition will strengthen its position as one of the largest bauxite and alumina producers in the world, thus providing better opportunities for value creation. With this buyout, management expects to be less dependent on other suppliers and effectively cater to the increased global demand for aluminum. The transaction will also help AA to effectively manage the current portfolio restructuring actions in AWAC and flourish through better operational focus and financial flexibility.
Alcoa, with a $5.5 billion market capitalization, currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The company has been reaping the benefits from higher shipments of alumina, primarily driven by increasing trading activity and shipments across refineries. Also, lower raw materials and decreasing production costs have been supporting the company’s performance.
The company’s shares have gained 5.9% compared with the industry’s growth of 5.4% in the past six months.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AA’s 2024 earnings has declined 41.1% over the last 30 days.
Some better-ranked companies from the Zacks Industrial Products sector are discussed below.
 ATMU presently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 20.3%, on average. You can see

Alcoa Corp Reports Q1 2024 Results: Deepens Net Loss Amid Strategic Acquisitions and ... 2024-04-17T21:32:42.000Z

On April 17, 2024, Alcoa Corp (
) released its 
, detailing its financial performance for the first quarter of 2024. The period was marked by strategic moves including the acquisition of Alumina Limited and the initiation of a potential sale of the San Ciprian complex. Despite these strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing operational flexibility and financial stability, the company faced a deepened net loss compared to the previous quarter.
Alcoa Corp is a leader in the production of bauxite, alumina, and aluminum products, known for its pioneering technologies and sustainable practices. With operations spanning bauxite mining, alumina refining, and aluminum manufacturing, Alcoa's profitability is closely linked to commodity prices along the aluminum supply chain. The company's primary revenue comes from its Aluminum segment, with a significant portion of its business based in the United States.
During the quarter, Alcoa focused on several strategic and operational adjustments. Notably, the company entered into a binding agreement to acquire Alumina Limited, a move expected to simplify corporate structures and enhance market flexibility. Additionally, Alcoa initiated the sale process for the San Ciprian complex and announced the curtailment of the Kwinana refinery in Australia, set to complete in Q2 2024. These decisions are part of a broader strategy to optimize operations and reduce costs amidst challenging market conditions.
Alcoa's financial results for Q1 2024 reflect the ongoing pressures in the aluminum market. The reported revenue saw a slight increase from the previous quarter but was down year-over-year. The significant net loss was exacerbated by a $197 million charge related to the Kwinana refinery's curtailment and a non-recurrence of a substantial tax benefit from the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA, although improved sequentially due to lower energy and raw material costs, remained lower than the previous year's figures, indicating persistent operational challenges.
Looking ahead, Alcoa does not anticipate changes in its production and shipment projections for 2024, maintaining steady expectations despite the current market volatility. The company also expects increased interest expenses following its green bond issuance. Alcoa's management remains focused on strategic initiatives to enhance shareholder value and operational efficiency in a fluctuating economic environment.
Alcoa plans to continue updating investors through press releases, SEC filings, and its corporate website. More detailed financial information and future updates will be provided in upcoming quarterly calls and reports.
For detailed financial figures and further information on Alcoa's strategic initiatives and operational adjustments, stakeholders are encouraged to refer to the full 8-K filing and subsequent investor communications.

Good afternoon, and welcome to the Alcoa Corporation First Quarter 2024 Earnings Presentation and Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded. 
I would now like to turn the conference over to James Dwyer, Vice President, Investor Relations and Pension Investments. Please go ahead.
Thank you, and good day, everyone. I'm joined today by William Oplinger, Alcoa Corporation President and Chief Executive Officer; and Molly Beerman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions after comments by Bill and Molly. 
As a reminder, today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations that are subject to various assumptions and caveats. Factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in today's presentation and in our SEC filings. 
In addition, we have included some non-GAAP financial measures in this presentation. For historical non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the appendix to today's presentation. We have not presented quantitative reconciliations of certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures for reasons noted on this slide. Any reference in our discussion today to EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA. 
Finally, as previously announced, the earnings press release and slide presentation are available on our website. With that, here's Bill.
Thanks, Jim, and welcome, everyone, to our first quarter 2024 earnings call. It's a pleasure to discuss our recent activities and performance with you today. Let's start with the transaction that we announced in late February, our proposed acquisition of Alumina Limited, which would give Alcoa 100% ownership in the Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals, or AWAC, joint venture. In the all-stock transaction, Alumina Limited shareholders would receive 0.02854 Alcoa shares for each Alumina Limited share. 
Based on Alcoa's and Alumina Limited's closing prices as of February 23, 2024, the agreed ratio implied an equity value of approximately $2.2 billion for Alumina Limited and a premium of 13.1% to Alumina Limited share price. Today, through a complex web holdings at a subsegment level, Alumina Limited shareholders have exposure to 40% of only the AWAC bauxite alumina and aluminum assets. Upon completion of the transaction, Alumina Limited shareholders will own 31.25% and Alcoa shareholders would own 68.75% of the combined company on a fully diluted basis. We believe the acquisition will deliver immediate and significant value for both companies' shareholders and it's the right path forward for both Alcoa and Alumina Limited. 
Alumina Limited shareholders will participate in the upside potential of a stronger, better capitalized company with a larger and more diversified upstream aluminum portfolio. Alcoa offers a full suite of low carbon and recycled content products and has long-term technology projects under development to transform the upstream aluminum value chain. Additionally, Alcoa shares will be traded in Australia through a secondary listing on the Australian Securities Exchange, or ASX, via CHESS Depositary Interest, or CDI. 
And as stated earlier, it elevates the ownership position of Alumina Limited shareholders and provides them with a premium over the recent share price for their noncontrolling interest. For Alcoa stockholders, the transaction increases Alcoa's economic interest in our core Tier 1 bauxite and alumina assets and simplifies governance, resulting in greater operational flexibility and strategic optionality. It advances our position as the global pure-play upstream aluminum company and enhances Alcoa's vertical integration along the value chain across bauxite mining, alumina refining and aluminum smelting. 
Alcoa would significantly increase its ownership in 5 of the 20 largest bauxite mines and 5 of the 20 largest alumina refineries globally, excluding China. Following this transaction, Alcoa will be better positioned to continue our long-term plan of investing in Australian bauxite mining and alumina refining. Together, Alcoa and Alumina Limited shareholders will benefit several ways. There are tangible near-term cost synergies and potential for further organizational optimization, replacing the complex JV arrangement with a simpler, less expensive structure. 
We will be more efficient in executing decisions with a view to maximizing returns with fully aligned interest among Alcoa and former Alumina Limited shareholders. We remain fully committed to our capital allocation framework. The all-stock transaction preserves Alcoa's balance sheet strength and provides capital structure flexibility. As one company, we will continue to have opportunities to pay distributions to shareholders while also transforming the portfolio and positioning ourselves for growth, deploying capital to maximize value creation. So in sum, we believe this is the right deal for Alumina Limited shareholders, for Alcoa shareholders and our broader stakeholders and communities. We are confident the transaction will build on our leading position as a global pure-play aluminum company and improve our ability to execute on long-term strategies and growth opportunities. 
Finally, a quick note on transaction timing. We expect to close the transaction in the third quarter. In the second quarter, we expect that Alcoa will be filing a proxy statement and Alumina Limited will be filing a scheme booklet in connection with the transaction. There are also government approvals that we are seeking in the second and third quarters, which include, in Australia, the Foreign Investment Review Board in the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, and in Brazil, the Brazil Administrative Council for Economic Defense. We expect to apply for our ASX listing in May, and finally, but most importantly, the shareholder votes to approve the transaction and issue an exchange shares are expected to take place in the third quarter. 
Now let's talk about the first quarter. It was a quarter. First and foremost, we had no fatal or serious injuries in the first quarter. Our key lagging indicators, days away restricted time, total recordable injuries and all injury rates all improved. The improving safety performance is driven by a concerted focus on safety across the company and by using programs that include managing critical risks and increasing the positive impact of our leaders spending time in the field. No matter what, safety is always our first priority. 
Other items to note in the quarter, in addition to announcing the Alumina Limited acquisition, we continued efforts to find a long-term solution for the San Ciprián complex and we've started a process to potentially sell the facility. We completed the restart of one potline at Warrick, and we set records for quarterly production rates at 2 smelters, ABI and Mosjøen. We fully deployed the $100 million productivity and competitiveness program, and we announced the Kwinana full curtailment. Finally, in March, we issued a $750 million green bond to support our cash position using Alcoa's new green financing framework. 
Now I'll turn it over to Molly to take us through the financials.
Thank you, Bill. Revenue was flat sequentially at $2.6 billion. In the Alumina segment, third-party revenue increased 6% due to higher average realized third-party price for alumina and higher shipments. In the Aluminum segment, third-party revenue decreased 3% due to lower average realized third-party price for aluminum. The net loss attributable to Alcoa changed $102 million to $252 million, and the loss per share changed from $0.84 to $1.41. On an adjusted basis, the net loss attributable to Alcoa was $145 million or $0.81. The difference is primarily related to the restructuring costs and other charges for the Kwinana curtailment. Adjusted EBITDA increased $43 million to $132 million. 
Let's look at the key drivers of EBITDA. First quarter 2024 adjusted EBITDA increased $43 million, primarily due to improved energy costs. Raw material and other cost benefits were offset by volume and production costs. The unfavorable production costs included the single quarter recognition of Section 45X of the Inflation Reduction Act credits for Warrick and Massena, while last quarter included impacts for the full year based on the timing of approval. Alumina segment EBITDA increased $55 million sequentially, primarily due to higher alumina prices and favorable currency impacts. Lower raw material and energy costs mostly offset higher production costs and lower shipment volumes in Brazil and Australia. 
Aluminum segment declined $30 million sequentially. While we also saw a substantial benefit from lower energy and raw material costs, those benefits were more than offset by unfavorable currency and metal prices, primarily due to the end of the metal hedge program at Alumar. Other factors are higher alumina costs and unfavorable reduction costs, including impacts from the just mentioned 45X credits. Outside the segments, transformation demolition costs, other corporate costs and intersegment eliminations all improved. 
Let's look at cash movements within the first quarter on the next slide. In the first quarter, working capital changes, capital expenditures and environmental and ARO payments were the largest uses of cash. Working capital as a significant use of cash in the first quarter is typical for us. However, the first quarter 2024 increase was significantly lower than the last 2 years' levels. Capital spend and environmental and ARO payments were both in line with our 2024 outlook, although the spend is not ratable for the year. Sources of cash in the quarter include the debt issuance of $750 million. The additional liquidity provides us with the flexibility needed to continue to execute the actions, which further strengthen our asset portfolio. 
 
In the longer term, our capital allocation framework remains unchanged and focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet. In regard to our debt issuance, this is the first issue under our new green finance framework, which prioritizes expenditures and climate change mitigation through projects in circular or low carbon products and pollution-prevention technologies while supporting renewable energy and water management. Proceeds from the issue cover both new and existing decarbonization and water management projects; our research and development expenses related to our breakthrough technologies ELYSIS, ASTRAEA and Refinery of the Future; purchases of renewable energy as well as certain costs related to the reduction of our low-carbon alumina and aluminum products. 
Under the green finance framework, the net proceeds of a green financing debt can be allocated to qualifying expenditures on a 2-year look back and 3-year look forward. We do not expect to allocate part of the net proceeds to significant capital investments in our breakthrough technologies as we do not expect those to occur in the remainder of this decade. 
Moving on to other key financial metrics. Our key financial metrics are consistent with our earnings results. Year-to-date return on equity was negative 14.5%. Days working capital increased 8 days to 47 days sequentially, primarily due to higher accounts receivable. 
Our fourth quarter dividend added $19 million to stockholder capital returns. While free cash flow plus net noncontrolling interest contributions was negative for the quarter at $269 million, impacted by the typical first quarter working capital build, the cash balance increased $500 million to $1.4 billion, including proceeds from the debt issuance. 
Let's turn to the outlook for the second quarter. We have one update to our full year outlook on the income statement. Interest expense is changing from $110 million to $145 million in light of our debt issue. 
Regarding sequential changes for the second quarter. In the Alumina segment, we expect impact of approximately $20 million related to higher seasonal maintenance and other mining costs for the Australian operations. In the Aluminum segment, we expect favorable raw material and production costs to fully offset unfavorable energy impacts. Alumina cost in the Aluminum segment are expected to be unfavorable by $15 million. 
Below EBITDA, note that first quarter other expenses included onetime negative impacts from foreign currency losses of approximately $20 million. Based on last week's pricing, we expect second quarter 2024 operational tax expense to approximate $40 million to $50 million. 
Lastly, I'd like to provide a quick update on our near-term actions for profitability improvement as we guided last quarter. For the second quarter, we have locked in more of the $310 million year-over-year savings in raw material costs, although not as prominent from a sequential view. Our productivity and competitiveness initiatives are identified and being implemented. We are on track to deliver at a full run rate by the first quarter of 2025 as committed. 
The Warrick third line restart was completed at the end of March; however, additional actions have been identified and need to be deployed to achieve profitability. The smelter is not expected to have significant improvement in the second quarter, but is projecting an improved second half of 2024. The full improvement is not expected to be reached until the end of 2025. 
Kwinana curtailment is going according to plan, and we expect to start seeing some savings in the second half of 2024. Although stability continues to be a challenge at the Alumar smelter, we remain committed to delivering our near-term targets by the end of 2025. 
Now I'll turn it back to Bill.
Thanks, Molly. The near-term markets are showing signs of improvement, and the long-term outlook remains very positive for both alumina and aluminum. For alumina, alumina prices recently reached a 2-year high. While demand has remained steady, near-term supply concerns have continued. Chinese refineries have curtailed capacity due to bauxite shortages and environmental issues. The fuel depot explosion in Guinea raises concerns about the security of supply for China's and the world's largest seaborne bauxite source. The Queensland Australia gas supply disruption as well as our announced curtailment of the Kwinana refinery has made Australian alumina supply less certain. 
Long-term alumina demand is expected to grow alongside aluminum. But limited low-carbon energy sources and increasing reliance on seaborne bauxite supply, particularly for Chinese refineries, are expected to constrain the growth potential and cost competitiveness of future refineries. For aluminum, currently, demand is looking up. Demand in the automotive and electrical sectors have remained strong, and we are seeing signs of recovery in packaging. Building and construction remains the most challenged end market but is showing signs of stabilization, especially in North America. 
In our order book, we see sales of VAP, or value-added products, increasing both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. We are even seeing opportunities for spot sales across our portfolio. 
From a supply perspective, there are a few new projects coming online. Even considering the announced Yunnan restarts, China continues to hold to its 45 million metric ton production cap. So inventory days remain low, and unwanted Russian aluminum still makes up more than 90% of the LME inventory. The big news last week was that the U.S. and U.K. governments announced sanctions on Russian aluminum. The impact was to establish an import ban into the U.S. and the U.K. and restrict activity at the London Metal Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. This was the right decision, as Alcoa has consistently advocated, and we maintain that the EU should take action as well. As you might expect from this news, LME aluminum recently hit its highest level in a year and first quarter regional premiums in the U.S., Europe and Japan all increased sequentially. 
Long term, we remain bullish. More aluminum, both primary and secondary, will be needed to drive the renewable energy transition and achieve global decarbonization goals. Today, there are not enough announced projects to meet that expected demand. And future projects face challenges finding renewable energy supplies amid expected increases in carbon emission costs. Even China is adding aluminum to its emission trading system, or ETS. In summary, alumina and aluminum markets are improving in the near term and our long-term outlook remains very positive. 
Now let's review key activities at Alcoa. We continue to make progress on key near-term actions as well as keeping momentum on long-term activities. Focusing on the near term, the overall outlook is positive. We're seeing further improvement in purchase prices for key raw materials. So if the current market outlook continues, our expectation is to exceed our savings target. 
We have deployed our productivity and competitiveness program and expect to realize savings in the coming quarters, with full run rate improvement of $100 million by the first quarter of 2025. The restart of one potline at Warrick is complete, and we remain optimistic that we will see additional IRA funding decided by the U.S. government sometime this year. The Kwinana full curtailment, which we announced in January, is on track, with all production to be stopped by the end of the second quarter. We expect to see resulting EBITDA improvement in the third quarter. 
On a negative note, the Alumar restart has regressed. While we have solved a number of issues, we continue to struggle with equipment reliability and personnel experience, we have reinforced the leadership and expert teams in Brazil and are taking actions to improve its overall performance. San Ciprián is a focal point of our near-term actions. Consistent with the viability agreement, we restarted 32 pots in the first quarter. Our work is in 2 areas of focus: to take actions to make San Ciprián viable for the long term, and alternatively, to find a potential purchaser for the site. 
We have completed the optimization study and delineated a modest set of potential short-term and medium-term improvement actions. We are working on implementing actions while preserving cash. Though purchase prices for energy and sales prices have improved, the business remains unviable, and we do not expect near-term government support to be forthcoming. We started a potential sale process for the entire location, both the smelter and the refinery, and we expect to complete the bid process by the end of June. Any long-term solution requires government and union support. 
Consistent with all these actions and the current market environment, and barring reaching an acceptable outcome on either of these 2 paths, we expect cash to run out in the second half of 2024. At that point, Alcoa corporation will not provide further funds and hard decisions will need to be made. 
As a company, we are very excited about the progress we are making on multiple fronts. Through the Alumina Limited deal, we are increasing the economic interest in assets we already control and operate in an all-stock transaction that benefits all parties. We have safely executed an impressive list of operational activities to improve the business and we have more actions to complete, and both the alumina and aluminum markets are on the upswing. This is an exciting time to be at Alcoa. 
Operator, let's start the question-and-answer session.
(Operator Instructions) Our first question today is from Lucas Pipes with B. Riley.
Bill, first, to maybe start out on the macro side, a little bit higher level. With some of the changes that are expected on the power side and then the Chinese production cap, what's your view of kind of the relative market strength in aluminum versus alumina? And how should we see that in the context of the AWAC acquisition? And on AWAC, any view that you could share in terms of kind of synergies from a tax perspective and overhead.
Let me take the first question -- the second question first. The Alumina Limited deal is a long-term deal. It's a deal that we've been focused on for a while. And we think that it provides benefits to our shareholders and their shareholders and the communities that we work in. So the -- any near-term market dynamics really don't go into significant decision-making around the Alumina Limited deal. 
As far as the synergies go, fairly quickly, we can take out $12 million of overhead. And then there's potential synergies down the road on capital structure and being able to have debt in Australia. So there's some potential synergies there. 
We then step back to the original part of your question, the market dynamics for both alumina and aluminum are improving. I start with aluminum, we're seeing growth -- demand growth in all of our major markets, with the exception of European building construction. Everything else, so we're seeing demand growth on a year-over-year basis. That really is impacting the metal prices higher. It's also driving regional premiums higher in the Midwest and in Europe and in Japan. So good strong demand on the metal side. 
In the case of alumina, as we referenced in our prepared remarks, some of the uncertainty around the raw materials on alumina, for instance, bauxite coming out of Guinea and the gas situation in Northern Australia, has driven alumina prices up at the same time also. So our view for 2024, just to bring it back to a summary, is that aluminum will be fairly in balance, although we're seeing stronger demand than what we had anticipated. And alumina should be in deficit in 2024, with some of the curtailments that we've seen, specifically also with the curtailment of Kwinana in June of this year.
And then there's been a lot of government support recently. If you look to the U.S., there's been DoE funding for new smelter. We'll see what the details bring. In Europe, there's been over $8 billion in public funding announced for the transition of the steel industry. You've invested a lot in new technologies such as ELYSIS and the Refinery of the Future. I would imagine your programs would be prime candidates for some of these government initiatives. So at this time, could your programs benefit? Is there anything in the pipeline? How do you think about all that?
Lucas, we'll be looking at different forms of governmental support for our programs. However, one of the things to consider is that the implementation of our 3 breakthrough technologies will really be out post 2030. So any support that we would be looking for today would be on the R&D side. But any implementation or significant capital spend is really going into the next decade, and therefore, it doesn't match up well with the near-term governmental support.
The next question is from Chris LaFemina with Jefferies.
I wanted to ask about closure costs. So first on Kwinana. I think you said $80 million of cash outflow to close the refinery in 2024 and $35 million more in 2025. I assume the $80 million in the second half of the year. But I'm wondering, first of all, in addition to that $115 million, if there's anything else to close Kwinana. That's my first question.
Chris, let's clarify that those are curtailment costs and not closure costs. So most of those are severance costs and other environmental related to setting up the water treatment. So that's what you're seeing there. Our closure cost would be significantly more, but we've not made a decision. And that's, a decision at Kwinana will take some time if we were to go there, that we do need approvals actually to close permanently.
And then what about -- so kind of same question in San Ciprián. I'm not sure if I've seen any kind of estimates of what the cost would be. If you -- I mean, obviously, a sale might be a better outcome, but if you ultimately do close the refinery and the smelter, can you give us an estimate as to what that might cost?
In terms of a refinery closure without factoring in severance because in Spain, that's very difficult to estimate, you can think of that refinery closure is about a $200 million cost, a smelter could be between 25 and 50. And that would be on the environmental and ARO side, again, not counting severance because of a very different situation on severance in Spain.
And Chris, if I could just jump in real quickly. I think it's a little premature to be talking about curtailment or closure costs around San Ciprián. We're focused on 2 things, specifically around the site in San Ciprián, one is viability. And trying to make that site viable and we're working on a series of actions to take cost out. But ultimately, viability of the smelter will be low-cost, sustainable green electricity. 
And then secondly, we did announce in this quarter the -- launching a sale process, and we will go through that sale process through the second quarter and see if there are viable buyers for that site. Now we will not repeat some of the problems that we had in Avilés La Coruña. But -- and therefore, we're going to really focus on the viability of a potential buyer of that site. So it's a little premature at this point to talk of curtailment or closure costs. So I don't want to speculate there.
Understood. I'm just trying to figure out the different scenarios that might ultimately materialize there.
The next question is from Alex Hacking with Citi.
I guess, firstly, on working capital, any guidance there for the rest of the year. And then secondly, you mentioned that with raw material costs trending as they are, you might be able to exceed your savings targets. Is there any way of quantifying that? And how would that trade off against potentially higher energy costs that are linked to higher LME prices?
So Alex, on the working capital, for 2024, we are targeting $1 billion level by the end of the year. We closed the quarter at $1.4 billion, and we are working aggressively down towards the $1 billion mark by the end of the year. 
In terms of raw materials, we don't have another number above the 310 year-over-year that we committed to, but we are seeing favorable results coming in now and we do expect to exceed that. If you look at caustic prices, we are definitely recognizing the benefits of the lower purchase prices from the second half of '23 into the first half of '24. And current purchase prices are just very slightly elevated, but very comparable to pre-pandemic levels. We are still seeing declines on coke and pitch. And while we have a 3-month lag in inventory there, we expect that to continue throughout 2024 with those coming down.
Okay. And then just quickly on Alumar, it sounds like kind of switching over to EBITDA positive there, it's probably something that's more likely to happen now in 2025 and 2024. Is that fair? Or am I being too pessimistic?
I think it will depend on what metal price is. And as metal price has gone up, that's benefited the site. So it's going to depend there. And really in the case of Alumar, that site had been curtailed for about 8 years. And I think we just fundamentally underestimated how hard it was going to be to get that site back up and running, especially from a mechanical perspective, from the condition of some of the equipment there. So continue to work it, and it's delayed from where we thought it was going to be.
The next question is from Lawson Winder with Bank of America.
I might just follow up on Alumar and just position it from the point of view of several years ago, 8 years ago, as you mentioned, when you took the decision to close it. I mean it was among some of the higher-cost smelters in the world. I mean is there any questioning now at this point whether it might make sense to abandon the restart? And then -- and looking at it from another way, is there any thought to that asset potentially being sold?
So as far as consideration of abandoning the restart, Lawson, as you can imagine in our jobs, both Molly and I, we constantly need to be revisiting the decisions that we've made and make sure that on a go-forward basis, the actions that we take makes sense. And so with that statement, we have looked at what are our options in Alumar. We still believe, given the power contract that we have, the fact that it's co-located with the refinery, the fact that it's in a part of the world where it needs aluminum, the business case is still soft on a go-forward basis to continue with the restart. 
We are disappointed with the pace and the execution that we've seen on the restart. And there's really a couple of different areas. I mentioned the mechanical condition of some of the equipment. We continue to work through that. And then the other one is really around the technical expertise of the people that we have there. It has taken some time to make sure that the folks that we have there are able to effectively work through the restart. We've doubled down on some of the resources that we've provided out of the center of excellence and also some external resources. So at this point, we continue to work through the restart.
The next question is from Bill Peterson with JPMorgan.
Yes. So I guess maybe sticking on Alumar, but maybe also related to work because it sounds like you're facing some challenges in both and then there are some IRA things you're still trying to work out. Are the $75 million and $70 million for work in Kwinana still the right way to think about it, albeit more later in 2025? Or the challenge you spoke to more likely to take the savings level down.
Bill, we are still working toward those stated targets, and we do believe that they can be achieved by the end of '25. For Warrick, we did have a successful restart there. Now I don't expect to see considerable improvement in the second quarter. They have identified additional actions. Those will need to be implemented before we get to profitability. I think we indicated on the last call, we have about $30 million in IRA opportunity. We're waiting for a decision from the government on if direct materials can be included there. So that was part of Warrick. They had $60 million related to the operations and $30 million between Warrick and Massena on the IRA. 
On Alumar, we're still committed. Again, as Bill mentioned, we still expect to get through the issues that we're facing. We're knocking down items one by one in a very day-to-day focus there and fortunately, have enough expertise now on hand of trying to make progress there. 
And on Kwinana, I'll say that we had guided to a $70 million improvement there in the -- we will not see that. It will start to ramp in, say, in the second half of '24, but we should be in good shape for realization of Kwinana, the $70 million in '25.
Okay. If you think about the U.S. market, it's benefited from protection through Section 232. How do you see further protection evolving given the election year and also the headlines out this morning regarding Chinese material? Based on our math, it looks like around maybe 3% to 5% of total U.S. imports over the past few years.
So the headlines that came out this morning, if we just back up, the 232, we don't see that necessarily the 232 tariffs changing. And so we think those will stay in place. The headlines that came out this morning around potential increase of tariffs on 301 is, first of all, it's a fairly small subsegment of the aluminum that's used. And second of all, I guess, in our view, it's probably positive for our North American customers. And if it's positive for our North American downstream customers, we're supportive of the increased tariff level. Now it's very recent news, and we haven't seen any the final information. So that's a preliminary view.
The next question is from Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research.
As I look across your like remaining operations, there's still some curtailed smelting capacity and refining capacity. And in light of your optimistic outlook and the strength recently in aluminum, do you revisit like further Warrick restarts or Lista, for example? Or do you think about opportunities to maybe capitalize on this higher price in the near term or going forward as well?
You know that, for instance, in the case of Warrick and Lista, we always look at the economics of a potential restart. In those situations, we would need to have real clarity around near-term energy prices. And so we would consider it. However, in the case of, for instance, work, I want to make sure that we have the 3 lines running well and capture the savings that we've announced and gone out publicly with. And in the case of Lista, it would have to be an energy solution that we would be able to get over the near term.
Okay. Helpful. And I just want to understand Spain a little bit better. So when you think about selling the assets, but you're on the same breath, you're telling us that you're not very optimistic about them. So would a potential buyer have to have, I guess, you mentioned the other Spanish sale, and so they need to have some deep pockets and maybe a different relationship with the union and government. Like how do you sell an asset that you're telling people is struggling? I just want to understand that better and what your prospects you think there are?
Well, we're running a really broad-based sale process, and we've gone out to just about every strategic and financial buyer in the industry. And it will really be up to them to take a position around how they view some of the things that they can achieve either with the union or through governmental support and metal prices and alumina prices, right? So if somebody has a view that Europe will be short metal for the long term, potentially, they can justify buying the asset. We'll go through that process. At the same time, as I said, we'll be very focused around trying to ensure the viability of the site for ourselves and for a potential future buyer. And if we get to the second half of this year, and we don't have a buyer and we can't assure the viability. As we've said, we're not putting more money into that site and hard decisions will have to be made at that time.
Okay. And just to clarify, the view of running out of cash in the second half does include the recent run rate of aluminum and alumina prices.
So at -- I think we've said recently that we have about $200 million of internal lines of credit or cash, of which some of that is restricted cash associated with capital expenditures. And that largely includes the most recent view. Metal prices run up a little bit over the last few days. Maybe that pushes it out a month or 2. But that's the view, Timna, that it will be second half sometime.
The next question is from Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley.
On Alumar, just how potentially could the issue that you're facing now impact the $75 million incremental EBITDA that you expect to get from that operation by the end of 2025?
So Carlos, when we set that guidance for the $75 million improvement, we were really looking at the losses that we had accumulated in 2023 and setting a goal for ourselves to at least be back to a neutral to breakeven. So we're still on that path to get into 2025, hopefully turning the quarter into positive profitability. But that's why we are focused on the $75 million as being achievable.
All right. And then on the breakthrough technologies, which some of them are really exciting. What is going on that maybe it feels, at least to me, that it is delaying a little bit the implementation of the peso, which those are advancing. Any color that you can provide there on the ELYSIS or the Refinery of the Future, perhaps?
Yes. So ELYSIS, we continue to make progress on ELYSIS. We will have a commercial size test cell running in 2024 at the Rio Tinto's Alma smelter. That's a 450 kA cell. So from that cell, we'll be able to get good reading on how well it operates and be able to get a good feel for how well it operates today on the commercial side. So our view is that we won't be implementing anything until post 2030. That gives time for the technology to be completely developed and vetted out, so that when we get to a point of large capital expenditures for ELYSIS potlines, we'll have a good sense that the technology is completely solid.
And from what you see today, Bill, would you implement ELYSIS potlines in carbon smelter? Or do you think it should be more in a greenfield?
It's really early, Carlos. And what -- some of the restrictions that we will be placing on it is that it only makes sense for us to implement ELYSIS where we have green, sustainable power, renewable power that's inexpensive. So we'll be looking around the world both for brownfields and greenfields in the 2030 time frame to implement ELYSIS, but it will have to be on renewable, low-cost sustainable power.
The next question is from Katja Jancic with BMO Capital Markets.
First, Bill, can you provide an update on the permitting process for the new bauxite mine areas in Western Australia?
Yes. So we're focused on -- continue to be focused on EPA assessment process. We're moving forward on the Part IV process for Myara North and Holyoake. There are a series of steps that are outlined on our website. So it actually makes it much easier for you to follow along and see how you can hold us accountable for moving forward. We will have -- we expect an EPA public comment period on the environmental review document. That could be as early as the second quarter of 2024. Maybe that goes into the third quarter. 
We'll prepare responses to the submissions for that in the third quarter of 2024. The EPA will publish a report on their assessment and, we say, in the first quarter of 2025. That's all leading toward a ministerial decision at the end of 2025, the fourth quarter of 2025, so that we can implement the mine move so that we can get there no earlier than 2027. So those are the various steps, and we're continuing to make progress on those steps.
Okay. And then maybe on the 45X credit, do you think alumina and other input costs are eventually going to be included in the calculation? And if so, what would the incremental benefit for you potentially be?
So Katja, if alumina and all of our raw materials are included, we should see about a $30 million to $40 million benefit from the direct material inclusion. We have made our case to the government and now we are awaiting a word.
Is there any time line on when the decision could be made?
Unfortunately, no.
The next question is from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research.
So I guess encouraging news on the sanctions out of the U.K. and the U.S. And with the Russian aluminum situation, any read or thought about the EU there following through? And maybe on the dynamics of the marketplace. I mean certainly basin prices have improved and certainly a loans benefit. But can you get a sense of, I guess, the customer base really kicking in here on the demand side? And is some of the dynamics on the maybe speculative or some of the dynamics with regard to some of the metals flow could be more or less supportive in this recent run, Bill?
So a lot of components to that question, Mike. So let me try to parse it out a little bit. But if we start with the Russian sanctions, the first and foremost, we're appreciative of the action that was taken by the U.S. and the U.K. governments. We've been supporting this type of action for and really advocating for this type of action for a couple of years now. Prior to the announcement on Friday, and just to be clear, the index price, and this has been our argument for 2 years, the index price for all metal sales had been set by Russian units, which we believe were discounted in the marketplace. And so you had a global pricing mechanism that had lost its credibility because it was based on a product that wasn't widely accepted in the market. So this move reestablishes the credibility of the benchmark price. 
To go to the second part of the question, we think it paves the way for the EU to take similar action, and we would obviously advocate for similar action. 
And then the third part of the question is, I would not attribute all of the price moves recently to this Russian sanctions move. We are seeing strong demand across the board. As I said in my prepared remarks, in just about every industry and every region that we serve, with the exception of European building construction, but if it's packaging, automotive, transportation, electrical transmission, we're seeing growth in each of those markets. And again, if it's China, Europe or North America, we see it in all markets. So the price movement that we've seen on the LME can be attributed in part to the Russia sanctions, in part to some of the strength in demand, price movement that we've seen in the premiums, we think, is related to stronger demand, too. So you've seen the Midwest premium move up, the European premiums move up, and the Japanese premium move up also. So we're really feeling as if we're in a spot where the -- we're getting some tailwinds from the marketplace.
The next question is from John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research.
Will Alcoa apply for a $0.5 billion grant like Century did? And do you have site infrastructure? It's some of your existing or prior facilities that would make it cheaper for you to build a large smelter and a brownfield or existing site rather than starting fresh?
John, we have existing sites around the U.S., for instance, Massena East, which is the old Reynolds facility, Massena West, Point Comfort, Intalco, Wenatchee. Off the top of my head, I don't know that any of those would have large enough electrical infrastructure to make a meaningful difference in putting a new site, a new plant there. So on the margin, it may. I think those sites are much better suited for redevelopment, and that's why we have our transformation group, and you have seen some of the real successes over the last couple of years, dating back to when we sold Rockdale for $250 million, and we sold Eastalco for $100 million. We get real value out of some of these sites through a redevelopment program and then sell them, and we'll continue to do that. 
To answer your first question, we would need -- very similar to the comment that I made to Carlos, we would need renewable energy at a low cost to make a large investment in the U.S. And in order for us to make that large investment, we would be going to the government also. It's not in the works right now, John. That's not on our agenda. We've not talked about that. And it's just not on my agenda over the near term to have that done.
So if I can ask another, why do you think the government shows the April 13 cutoff dates for bidding the Russian metals as opposed to for bidding the preexisting metal wherever it might be laying around? A lot of the aluminum is stuck in Korea, anyway, in warehouses.
I don't have a good answer for you. I can't speculate why the government chose the date they chose. I'm just pleased that they took the action that they did and really think that it is the first step towards reestablishing the credibility of the aluminum contract on the LME, and I'm glad they did it. And whether they have chosen the 12th or the 14th, I'm just glad they did it.
Your next question is a follow-up from Lucas Pipes with B. Riley.
Bill, on the copper side, there's a lot of excitement about AI, electrification of everything and obviously, aluminum benefits as a substitute in many of those ways. But aluminum also competes for electricity. So when you kind of think about the demand side, but then also kind of additional costs in the supply side when you net it out, what do you think does it mean for the aluminum industry longer term? And how would you position Alcoa for that trend?
So Lucas, thanks for the question. I fundamentally believe that aluminum is an integral part of the energy transition that will occur in the world over the next 25 years. Copper is critically important, but aluminum is right there also. There's a historical reference point of like 3,500 -- I'm sorry, 3.5x difference between copper price and aluminum price that when copper goes up, there's a substitution effect between copper and aluminum. We see that holding true today. And as copper becomes more expensive, we think that, that will benefit aluminum. 
However, aluminum monotone, and you know this story, critically important to electrification, critically important to electric vehicles. You look at how much is used in applications around solar applications for the panels, the frames of the panels, the wind turbines, it's a significant driver of aluminum. And we're looking at, I think CRU says 80% increase in aluminum demand between now and 2050. So I think the future is really bright for aluminum and copper, but aluminum especially.
And on the power side, what do you think it means for how you're positioned?
Well, I think on the power side, renewable green power is getting harder and harder, and it doesn't -- to find globally. And so it doesn't matter if it's being used for something else associated with the transition of energy, but it is getting harder and harder to find, which ultimately means that supply, to some extent, will be limited, right? The supply growth over time will really be based on green energy. And if green energy sources are being used for other things like data centers, I think it limits supply. So again, you can tell I'm pretty bullish on aluminum, and I think both of those factors play into a stronger aluminum market in the future.
This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Oplinger for his closing remarks.
Thanks, Gary. And as we just said to Lucas, as you can hear from our voice, Molly and I are really excited about the future of the company. We think we made substantial progress in the quarter, with the Alumina Limited deal being announced and the other operational actions that we took. The markets are, in our view, a tailwind and the markets are improving. We didn't really talk that much about the fact that our back book is improving also. So while metal prices and alumina prices and premiums are going up, we're seeing that VAP sales, value-added product sales, go up also. And so with all that, we'll sign off. We're looking forward to talking to you in July. Thank you.
The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

Alcoa Corporation (NYSE:AA) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript 2024-04-19T16:11:17.000Z

Alcoa Corporation (NYSE:
) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript April 17, 2024
Alcoa Corporation misses on earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $-0.81 EPS, expectations were $-0.62. AA isn't one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (
).
 Good afternoon, and welcome to the Alcoa Corporation First Quarter 2024 Earnings Presentation and Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to James Dwyer, Vice President, Investor Relations and Pension Investments. Please go ahead.
 Thank you, and good day everyone. I am joined today by William Oplinger, Alcoa Corporation's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Molly Beerman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions after comments by Bill and Molly. As a reminder, today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations that are subject to various assumptions and caveats. Factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in today's presentation and in our SEC filings. In addition, we have included some non-GAAP financial measures in this presentation. For historical non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the appendix to today's presentation.
We have not presented quantitative reconciliations of certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures for reasons noted on this slide. Any reference in our discussion today to EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA. Finally, as previously announced, the earnings press release and slide presentation are available on our website. With that, here's Bill.
 Thanks, Jim, and welcome everyone to our first quarter 2024 earnings call. It's a pleasure to discuss our recent activities and performance with you today. Let's start with the transaction that we announced in late February. Our proposed acquisition of Alumina Limited, which would give Alcoa 100% ownership in the Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals, or AWAC, joint venture. In the all-stock transaction, Alumina Limited shareholders would receive 0.02854 Alcoa shares for each Alumina Limited share. Based on Alcoa's and Alumina Limited's closing prices as of February 23, 2024, the agreed ratio implied an equity value of approximately $2.2 billion for Alumina Limited and a premium of 13.1% to Alumina Limited's share price.
Today, through a complex [web holdings] (ph) at a subsegment level, Alumina Limited shareholders have exposure to 40% of only the AWAC bauxite, alumina and aluminum assets. Upon completion of the transaction, Alumina Limited shareholders will own 31.25% and Alcoa shareholders would own 68.75% of the combined company on a fully diluted basis. We believe the acquisition will deliver immediate and significant value for both companies' shareholders and is the right path forward for both Alcoa and Alumina Limited. Alumina Limited's shareholders will participate in the upside potential of a stronger, better capitalized company with a larger and more diversified upstream aluminum portfolio. Alcoa offers a full suite of low carbon and recycled content products and has long-term technology projects under development to transform the upstream aluminum value chain.
Additionally, Alcoa shares will be traded in Australia through a secondary listing on the Australian Securities Exchange, or ASX, via CHESS Depositary Interests, or CDIs. And as stated earlier, it elevates the ownership position of Alumina Limited shareholders and provides them with a premium over the recent share price for their non-controlling interests. For Alcoa stockholders, the transaction increases Alcoa's economic interest in our core tier-1 bauxite and alumina assets and simplifies governance, resulting in greater operational flexibility and strategic optionality. It advances our position as the global pure play upstream aluminum company and enhances Alcoa's vertical integration along the value chain across bauxite mining, aluminum refining, and aluminum smelting.
Alcoa would significantly increase its ownership in five of the 20 largest bauxite mines and five of the 20 largest alumina refineries globally, excluding China. Following this transaction, Alcoa will be better positioned to continue our long-term plan of investing in Australian bauxite mining and alumina refining. Together, Alcoa and Alumina Limited shareholders will benefit several ways. There are tangible near-term cost synergies and potential for further organizational optimization, replacing the complex JV arrangement with a simpler, less expensive structure. We will be more efficient in executing decisions with a view to maximizing returns with fully aligned interest among Alcoa and former Alumina Limited shareholders. We remain fully committed to our capital allocation framework.
The all-stock transaction preserves Alcoa's balance sheet strength and provides capital structure flexibility. As one company, we will continue to have opportunities to pay distributions to shareholders, while also transforming the portfolio and positioning ourselves for growth, deploying capital to maximize value creation. So in sum, we believe this is the right deal for Alumina Limited shareholders, for Alcoa shareholders, and our broader stakeholders and communities. We're confident the transaction will build on our leading position as a global pure play aluminum company and improve our ability to execute on long-term strategies and growth opportunities. Finally, a quick note on transaction timing. We expect to close the transaction in the third quarter.
In the second quarter, we expect that Alcoa will be filing a proxy statement and Alumina Limited will be filing a scheme booklet in connection with the transaction. There are also government approvals that we are seeking in the second and third quarters, which include, in Australia, the Foreign Investment Review Board and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, and in Brazil, the Brazil Administrative Council For Economic Defense. We expect to apply for our ASX listing in May. And finally, but most importantly, the shareholder votes to approve the transaction and issue and exchange shares are expected to take place in the third quarter. Now, let's talk about the first quarter. It was a busy quarter. First and foremost, we had no fatal or serious injuries in the first quarter.
Our key lagging indicators, days away restricted time, total recordable injuries, and all injury rates all improved. The improving safety performance is driven by a concerted focus on safety across the company and by using programs that include managing critical risks and increasing the positive impact of our leaders spending time in the field. No matter what, safety is always our first priority. Other items to note in the quarter, in addition to announcing the Alumina Limited acquisition, we continued efforts to find a long-term solution for the San Ciprián complex, and we've started a process to potentially sell the facility. We completed the restart of one potline at Warrick, and we set records for quarterly production rates at two smelters, ABI and Mosjøen.
We fully deployed the $100 million productivity and competitiveness program, and we announced the Kwinana full curtailment. Finally, in March, we issued a $750 million green bond to support our cash position using Alcoa's new green financing framework. Now, I'll turn it over to Molly to take us through the financials.
 Thank you, Bill. Revenue was flat sequentially at $2.6 billion. In the alumina segment, third-party revenue increased 6% due to higher average realized third-party price for alumina and higher shipments. In the aluminum segment, third-party revenue decreased 3% due to lower average realized third-party price for aluminum. The net loss attributable to Alcoa changed $102 million to $252 million, and the loss per share changed from $0.84 to $1.41. On an adjusted basis, the net loss attributable to Alcoa was $145 million or $0.81. The difference is primarily related to the restructuring costs and other charges for the Kwinana curtailment. Adjusted EBITDA increased $43 million to $132 million. Let's look at the key drivers of EBITDA.
First quarter 2024 adjusted EBITDA increased $43 million primarily due to improved energy costs. Raw material and other cost benefits were offset by volume and production costs. The unfavorable production costs included the single quarter recognition of Section 45X of the Inflation Reduction Act credits for Warrick and Massena, while last quarter included impacts for the full year based on the timing of approval. Alumina segment EBITDA increased $55 million sequentially, primarily due to higher alumina prices and favorable currency impacts. Lower raw material and energy costs mostly offset higher production costs and lower shipment volumes in Brazil and Australia. Aluminum segment declined $30 million sequentially. While we also saw substantial benefit from lower energy and raw material costs, those benefits were more than offset by unfavorable currency and metal prices, primarily due to the end of the metal hedge program at Alumar.
Other factors are higher alumina costs and unfavorable production costs, including impacts from the just mentioned 45X credits. Outside the segments, transformation demolition costs, other corporate costs and intersegment elimination all improved. Let's look at cash movements within the first quarter on the next slide. In the first quarter, working capital changes, capital expenditures, and environmental and ARO payments were the largest uses of cash. Working capital as a significant use of cash in the first quarter is typical for us. However, the first quarter 2024 increase was significantly lower than the last two years' levels. Capital spend and environmental and ARO payments were both in line with our 2024 outlook, although the spend is not ratable for the year.
Sources of cash in the quarter include the debt issuance of $750 million. The additional liquidity provides us with the flexibility needed to continue to execute the actions which further strengthen our asset portfolio. In the longer term, our capital allocation framework remains unchanged and focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet. In regard to our debt issuance, this is the first issue under our new Green Finance Framework, which prioritizes expenditures and climate change mitigation through projects in circular or low-carbon products and pollution prevention technologies while supporting renewable energy and water management. Proceeds from the issue cover both new and existing decarbonization and water management projects, our research and development expenses related to our breakthrough technologies, ELYSIS, ASTREA, and Refinery of the Future, purchases of renewable energy, as well as certain costs related to the production of our low carbon alumina and aluminum products.
Under the Green Finance Framework, the net proceeds of a green financing debt can be allocated to qualifying expenditures on a two-year look back and three-year look forward. We do not expect to allocate part of the net proceeds to significant capital investments in our breakthrough technologies as we do not expect those to occur in the remainder of this decade. Moving on to other key financial metrics. Our key financial metrics are consistent with our earnings results. Year-to-date return on equity was negative 14.5%. Days working capital increased 8 days to 47 days sequentially, primarily due to higher accounts receivable. Our fourth quarter dividend added $19 million to stockholder capital returns. While free cash flow plus net non-controlling interest contributions was negative for the quarter at $269 million, impacted by the typical first quarter working capital build, the cash balance increased $500 million to $1.4 billion, including proceeds from the debt issuance.
Let's turn to the outlook for the second quarter. We have one update to our full year outlook on the income statement. Interest expense is changing from $110 million to $145 million in light of our debt issue. Regarding sequential changes for the second quarter, in the alumina segment, we expect impacts of approximately $20 million related to higher seasonal maintenance and other mining costs for the Australian operation. In the aluminum segment, we expect favorable raw material and production costs to fully offset unfavorable energy impacts. Alumina costs and the aluminum segment are expected to be unfavorable by $15 million. Below EBITDA, note that first quarter other expenses included one-time negative impacts from foreign currency losses of approximately $20 million.
Based on last week's pricing, we expect second quarter 2024 operational tax expense to approximate $40 million to $50 million. Lastly, I'd like to provide a quick update on our near-term actions for profitability improvement as we guided last quarter. For the second quarter, we have locked in more of the $310 million year-over-year savings in raw material costs, although not as prominent from a sequential view. Our productivity and competitiveness initiatives are identified and being implemented. We are on track to deliver at a full run rate by the first quarter of 2025 as committed. The Warrick third-line restart was completed at the end of March. However, additional actions have been identified and need to be deployed to achieve profitability.
The smelter is not expected to have significant improvement in the second quarter, but is projecting an improved second half of 2024. The full improvement is not expected to be reached until the end of 2025. Kwinana curtailment is going according to plan and we expect to start seeing some savings in the second half of 2024. Although stability continues to be a challenge at the Alumar smelter, we remain committed to delivering our near-term targets by the end of 2025. Now, I'll turn it back to Bill.
 Thanks, Molly. The near-term markets are showing signs of improvement, and the long-term outlook remains very positive for both alumina and aluminum. For alumina, alumina prices recently reached a two-year high. While demand has remained steady, near-term supply concerns have continued. Chinese refineries have curtailed capacity due to bauxite shortages and environmental issues. The fuel depot explosion in Guinea raises concerns about the security of supply for China's and the world's largest seaborne bauxite source. The Queensland, Australia gas supply disruption, as well as our announced curtailment of the Kwinana refinery, has made Australian alumina supply less certain. Long-term alumina demand is expected to grow alongside aluminum, but limited low-carbon energy sources and increasing reliance on seaborne bauxite supply, particularly for Chinese refineries, are expected to constrain the growth potential and cost competitiveness of future refineries.
For aluminum, currently demand is looking up. Demand in the automotive and electrical sectors have remained strong, and we are seeing signs of recovery in packaging. Building and construction remains the most challenged end market, but it is showing signs of stabilization, especially in North America. In our order book, we see sales of VAP, or value-add products, increasing both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. We are even seeing opportunities for spot sales across our portfolio. From a supply perspective, there are few new projects coming online. Even considering the announced Yunnan restarts, China continues to hold to its 45 million metric ton production cap. So, inventory days remain low, and unwanted Russian aluminum still makes up more than 90% of the LME inventory.
The big news last week was that the US and UK governments announced sanctions on Russian aluminum. The impact was to establish an import ban into the US and the UK, and restrict activity at the London Metal Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. This was the right decision, as Alcoa has consistently advocated, and we maintain that the EU should take action as well. As you might expect from this news, LME aluminum recently hit its highest level in a year, and first quarter regional premiums in the US, Europe, and Japan all increased sequentially. Long term, we remain bullish. More aluminum, both primary and secondary, will be needed to drive the renewable energy transition and achieve global decarbonization goals. Today, there are not enough announced projects to meet that expected demand, and future projects face challenges finding renewable energy supplies amid expected increases in carbon emission costs.
Even China is adding aluminum to its emission trading system, or ETS. In summary, alumina and aluminum markets are improving in the near term, and our long-term outlook remains very positive. Now, let's review key activities at Alcoa. We continue to make progress on key near-term actions as well as keeping momentum on long-term activities. Focusing on the near-term, the overall outlook is positive. We're seeing further improvement in purchase prices for key raw materials, so if the current market outlook continues, our expectation is to exceed our savings target. We have deployed our productivity and competitiveness program and expect to realize savings in the coming quarters with full run rate improvement of $100 million by the first quarter of 2025.
The restart of one potline at Warrick complete, and we remain optimistic that we will see additional IRA funding decided by the US government sometime this year. The Kwinana full curtailment, which we announced in January, is on track with all production to be stopped by the end of the second quarter. We expect to see resulting EBITDA improvement in the third quarter. On a negative note, the Alumar restart has regressed. While we have solved a number of issues, we continue to struggle with equipment reliability and personnel experience. We have reinforced the leadership and expert teams in Brazil and are taking actions to improve its overall performance. San Ciprián is a focal point of our near-term actions. Consistent with the viability agreement, we restarted 32 pots in the first quarter.
Our work is in two areas of focus: to take actions to make San Ciprián viable for the long term, and alternatively, to find a potential purchaser for the site. We have completed the optimization study and delineated a modest set of potential short-term and medium-term improvement actions. We are working on implementing actions while preserving cash. Though purchase prices for energy and sales prices have improved, the business remains unviable, and we do not expect near-term government support to be forthcoming. We started a potential sale process for the entire location, both the smelter and the refinery, and we expect to complete the bid process by the end of June. Any long-term solution requires government and union support. Consistent with all these actions and the current market environment and barring reaching an acceptable outcome on either of these two paths, we expect cash to run out in the second half of 2024.
At that point, Alcoa Corporation will not provide further funds and hard decisions will need to be made. As a company, we are very excited about the progress we are making on multiple fronts. Through the Alumina Limited deal, we are increasing the economic interest in assets we already control and operate in an all-stock transaction that benefits all parties. We have safely executed an impressive list of operational activities to improve the business, and we have more actions to complete. And both the alumina and aluminum markets are on the upswing. This is an exciting time to be at Alcoa. Operator, let's start the question-and-answer session.

Alumina Limited's (ASX:AWC) institutional investors lost 6.4% over the past week but have profited from longer-term gains 2024-06-20T05:28:32.000Z

If you want to know who really controls Alumina Limited (
), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 42% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).
Institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to AU$4.6b last week. However, the 14% one-year returns may have helped alleviate their overall losses. They should, however, be mindful of further losses in the future.
Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Alumina, beginning with the chart below.
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
Alumina already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Alumina's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Alumina. Orbis Investment Management Limited is currently the company's largest shareholder with 19% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 9.6% and 9.3%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.
On further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 6 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.
While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.
Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.
Our information suggests that Alumina Limited insiders own under 1% of the company. However, it's possible that insiders might have an indirect interest through a more complex structure. It's a big company, so even a small proportional interest can create alignment between the board and shareholders. In this case insiders own AU$4.0m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking 
The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 39% stake in Alumina. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.
It seems that Private Companies own 9.3%, of the Alumina stock. It might be worth looking deeper into this. If related parties, such as insiders, have an interest in one of these private companies, that should be disclosed in the annual report. Private companies may also have a strategic interest in the company.
We can see that public companies hold 9.6% of the Alumina shares on issue. It's hard to say for sure but this suggests they have entwined business interests. This might be a strategic stake, so it's worth watching this space for changes in ownership.
It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Alumina better, we need to consider many other factors. Be aware that

Alcoa Corporation (AA): Will Its Alumina Limited Acquisition Make It Soar Even More? 2024-06-22T01:36:02.000Z

We recently compiled a list of the 
. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alcoa Corporation (NYSE:AA) stands against the other rare earth stocks and ETFs.
Rare earth elements (REEs), which refers to 17 metals that are similar chemically, are surprisingly abundant in Earth's crust. However, their dispersion and geochemical properties make them difficult and expensive to extract, leading to them being called "rare."
REEs are important for a vast range of technologies, earning them the nickname "vitamins of modern industry." Apart from being irreplaceable for clean energy and consumer electronics production, REEs are also strategic for defense and aerospace engineering, the production of aircraft, missiles, satellites, and communication systems.
Hence, it is no wonder that the global rare earth metals market is valued at an estimated $
 billion in 2024. Analysts project this market to experience steady growth, reaching $8.63 billion by 2031. This is equivalent to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.2% over this period, indicating a promising future for the industry.
China has been dominating the rare earth metals market for decades producing a staggering 240,000 metric tons last year, over five times more than its closest competitor, the United States, according to US Geological Survey 
. China further maintains its control by processing around 90% of the world's rare earths into permanent magnets used in various technologies. In 2022, China accounted for 70% of global production of REEs.  This dominance stems from a combination of factors, including historical geological exploration efforts, favorable mining conditions, and government support for the industry.
Brazil, along with other Western countries, is currently working towards breaking China’s dominance of this industry. Brazil has advantages like low labor costs, clean energy, and established regulations. However, challenges include low rare earth prices which have gone down 70%, technical difficulties, and getting funding. Despite these challenges, Brazil is making progress with its first mine in operation and increased government support for the industry. To jumpstart its rare earth industry, the Brazilian government allocated 1 billion reais ($194.53 million) in February to fund strategic mineral projects.
Other countries are also working towards diversifying the supply chain. In recent years, the United States has sought to mitigate risks related to the REEs’ supply chain. This includes restarting domestic mining operations, like the Mountain Pass site in California, and building processing facilities to avoid reliance on China. This objective of supply chain diversification has also led the US to secure deals with Vietnam on minerals and semiconductors.
Similar to the United States, the European Union (EU) is also actively promoting domestic extraction projects in countries such as Sweden, Finland, Spain, and Serbia. This is part of the EU's efforts to enhance its self-sufficiency in critical minerals, including rare earth elements.
To shortlist the best rare earth stocks, we relied on Insider Monkey's database of 919 hedge funds as of Q1 2024 to analyze the hedge fund sentiment for each stock. We picked the rare earth stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. Furthermore, we included two of the best rare earth ETFs, chosen for their impressive 3-year returns. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (
).

Chinese Alumina Producers Increase Output After Surge in Prices 2024-07-08T15:38:23.000Z

(Bloomberg) -- Chinese alumina producers are boosting output to take advantage of the highest prices in more than two years.
Most Read from Bloomberg
Prices for alumina, the main feedstock for aluminum smelters, reached $510 a ton in Western Australia on June 13, the highest since March 2022, according to SMM International. They’ve climbed more than 40% this year as alumina supplies were disrupted.
Those price gains are spurring alumina production in China, with new projects in Shandong, Chongqing, Inner Mongolia, and Guangxi due to come online in the second half of this year, according to Monte Zhang, managing director of AZ Global Consulting. That could generate a surplus in the next 18 months as more capacity is also added in Indonesia and India.
“Chinese alumina companies are motivated to produce,” Zhang said.
The looming rebound in alumina supply comes after disruptions in both China and Australia over the past 12 months boosted the market.
Alcoa Corp. announced it was shuttering its Kwinana alumina refinery — with an annual capacity of 2.2 million tons — in Western Australia in January. In May, Rio Tinto Group declared force majeure on alumina cargoes from its refineries in Queensland, Australia, because of regional gas shortages.
That supply squeeze helped send prices of aluminum on the London Metal Exchange to a 23-month high, and is driving up production costs for the lightweight metal in China.
As the tight supply unwinds, prices are likely to decline toward the marginal costs of alumina production, which is around the mid-$300-a-ton range, according to Colin Hamilton, managing director of commodities research at BMO Capital Markets
Ross Strachan, an analyst at CRU Group, concurs.
“Barring a further supply shock, we should expect the spell of sharp increases has now ended,” he said by email. “In fact, we expect prices will drop back appreciably later this year as alumina production recovers.”
Morgan Stanley analyst Amy Gower injects a note of caution, saying that China has indicated that additional alumina refinery capacity should be strictly controlled. That could potentially impact the market balance.
“Alumina volume growth in the long term could be limited,” Gower said in a note. “If China stopped growing, the alumina market would likely be in a persistent deficit.”

Alcoa Corporation reports positive preliminary results for Q2 2024 2024-07-10T17:30:08.000Z

Investing.com - Alcoa Corp (NYSE:AA) gained 2.2% in after-hours trade on Wednesday after unveiling preliminary financial results for the second quarter of 2024.
CEO William F. Oplinger expressed optimism about the preliminary results, attributing them to market improvements. The company is also gearing up to finalize the acquisition of Alumina (OTC:AWCMY) Limited by August 1, 2024.
Revenues are expected to range between $2,850 million and $2,925 million, indicating an increase from both Q1 2024 ($2,599 million) and Q2 2023 ($2,684 million).
Net income is projected between $5 million and $25 million for Q2 2024, a significant improvement from the net losses of $252 million in Q1 2024 and $102 million in Q2 2023.
Income per share is expected between $0.03 and $0.14, compared to a loss of $1.41 per share in Q1 2024 and a loss of $0.57 per share in Q2 2023.
The preliminary results suggest a decrease in alumina production of about 5%, primarily due to the full curtailment of the Kwinana refinery in June 2024. However, aluminum production is expected to be on par with the strong output of Q1 2024.
Meanwhile, total aluminum shipments are expected to rise by about 7%, primarily driven by the timing of shipments and the restart of one potline at Warrick Operations in Q1 2024.
Alcoa's cash balance is anticipated to be about $1.4 billion at the end of June 2024, consistent with the prior quarter. This balance results from increased cash provided from operations, partially offset by increased capital expenditures.
The company also highlighted key actions, including the acquisition of Alumina Limited and the advancement of ELYSIS technology. Alcoa continues to work towards viable energy solutions for the San Ciprián refinery and smelter and the potential sale of the complex.
Furthermore, the full curtailment of the Kwinana refinery in Australia was successfully completed in June 2024.

Good afternoon and welcome to the Alcoa Corporation second quarter 2024 earnings presentation and conference call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded.
 I would now like to turn the conference over to James Dwyer, Vice President, Investor Relations & Pension Investments. Please go ahead, sir.
Thank you and good day, everyone. I'm joined today by William Oplinger, Alcoa Corporation President and Chief Executive Officer; and Molly Beerman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions after comments by Bill and Molly.
 As a reminder, today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations that are subject to various assumptions and caveats. Factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in today's presentation and in our SEC filings.
 In addition, we have included some non-GAAP financial measures in this presentation. For historical non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the appendix to today's presentation.
 We have not presented quantitative reconciliations of certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures for reasons noted on this slide. Any reference in our discussion today to EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA. Finally, as previously announced, the earnings press release and slide presentation are available on our website.
 With that, here's Bill.
Thanks, Jim, and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Before we get to all the good work we have done in the quarter, I'm pleased to say that we are nearing completion of the Alumina Limited acquisition. We held the Alcoa Stockholder Meeting yesterday, and our Alcoa stockholders have voted overwhelmingly to approve issuing Alcoa shares for the transaction.
 The Alumina Limited shareholder meeting occurs in a few hours, and we expect a favorable result there, as well, which would lead to an expected transaction closing date of August 1. As you've heard we say before, we believe that this transaction is the right deal for both sets of shareholders, and we look forward to realizing its benefits and welcoming Alumina Limited shareholders into Alcoa.
 Now let's move to the quarter. First, I'm pleased that our safety programs continue to drive the right behaviors and are being reflected in both leading and lagging indicators. Safety is the linchpin of our care for people value and the bedrock upon which we build operational excellence. Second, our profitability improvement programs are delivering results and remain on track. Third, operational stability is evidenced by smelter production records at the Canadian system and Mosjoen, a safe and timely curtailment of Kwinana and steadily improving stability at the Alumar smelter.
 In addition, we continue to work toward the best possible resolution at San Ciprián as we strive to find competitive energy solutions and also progress the potential sale process. Finally, while we have been actively working on many fronts to improve the company, favorable alumina and aluminum markets have also helped improve our profitability and cash flows.
 With that, I will turn it over to Molly, who has the details.
Thank you, Bill. Revenue was up sequentially to $2.9 billion on higher alumina and aluminum prices. In the alumina segment, third-party revenue increased 5% due to the higher average realized third-party price, partially offset by lower shipments. In the aluminum segment, third-party revenue increased 16% on higher average realized third-party price and increased shipments. Second-quarter net income attributable to Alcoa was $20 million versus the loss in the prior quarter of $252 million with earnings per share improving by $1.52 to $0.11 per share.
 On an adjusted basis, the net earnings attributable to Alcoa was $30 million or $0.16 per share. Adjusted EBITDA increased $193 million to $325 million. Let's look at the key drivers of EBITDA. The second quarter adjusted EBITDA increase was primarily due to higher average realized third-party prices for alumina and aluminum, partially offset by lower volume and other costs.
 The alumina segment increased $47 million, primarily as higher alumina prices more than offset higher energy and production costs. The aluminum segment increased $183 million, primarily due to higher metal prices, partially offset by higher alumina costs. Raw material and production cost improvement more than offset volume impacts related to shipments from our restarted, Warrick and Alumar smelters.
 Outside the segments, other corporate costs increased primarily due to various labor related expenses. Intersegment eliminations were unfavorable in the quarter, which is expected as the higher average alumina price increase requires more profit elimination.
 Let's look at cash movements within the second quarter on the next slide. Year to date through June, capital expenditures and working capital changes were our largest uses of cash. The first half of 2024 capital expenditures includes an investment of $38 million, which is a portion of our commitment to purchase two vessels to provide bauxite transportation in Brazil. Two additional vessels will be leased.
 We have an opportunity for a significant reductions in bauxite freight cost between our Juruti mine and Alumar refinery. We estimate savings to be $14 to $16 per ton of alumina. The first vessel arrived in Brazil this week with an additional three ships to be received later this year. We hired a contract operator with considerable expertise in the region to manage the technical operations on our behalf.
 Through the first six months of 2024, working capital is a use of cash. While we normally start to reduce working capital after the first quarter, higher alumina and aluminum prices in the second quarter raised accounts receivable more than the decrease in inventories, leaving the working capital balance close to flat between quarters. We still expect to continue to reduce the working capital balance throughout the remainder of the year.
 Moving on to the other key financial metrics. While improving, the year to date return on equity was negative 5.8%. Days working capital decreased 6 days to 41 days sequentially, primarily due to a decrease in inventory days, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable days, both on higher sales in the second quarter and favorable changes in the balances.
 Our second quarter dividend added $18 million to stockholder capital return. Free cash flow less net noncontrolling interest distributions was positive for the quarter at $101 million, improving sequentially by $370 million. The cash balance was maintained at $1.4 billion. In connection with the Alumina Limited acquisition, Alcoa will assume approximately $390 million of the debt drawn on their revolver. We are looking at delevering options and expect to reduce debt levels as we continue to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet and improving operations.
 On the outlook for the third quarter, other corporate cost is changing from approximately $120 million to approximately $140 million due to the previously mentioned additional labor related expenses. Interest expense is changing from approximately $145 million to approximately $160 million related to the Alumina Limited debt assumed at acquisition closing.
 Return-seeking capital is changing problem approximately $90 million to approximately $110 million as we are considering several return-seeking projects with attractive rates of return, primarily enhancements to our value add product capabilities and small creek projects.
 Regarding sequential changes for the third quarter, in the alumina segment, we expect unfavorable impacts of approximately $10 million related to Australia bauxite grade. In the aluminum segment, we expect favorable raw material prices of approximately $10 million. While the higher price of alumina will increase overall Alcoa adjusted EBITDA, alumina costs in the Aluminum segment are expected to be unfavorable by $60 million.
 Below EBITDA, we expect third quarter interest expense to increase by $5 million. Based on last week's pricing, we expect third quarter 2024 operational tax expense to approximate $60 million to $70 million. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest will be reported through acquisition closing and is expected to approximate $20 million.
 In relation to our expected closing of the Alumina Limited acquisition on August 1, you'll see certain changes to our financial statements. In the appendix, we have included June 30, financials with notations on the changes to the made in the third quarter.
 As expected, the income statement will no longer reflect the portion of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest and the balance sheet will reflect the debt assumed and collapse the non-controlling interest equity into additional capital. On the cash flow statement, the distributions to non-controlling interests will end. Please see the appendix for additional details.
 Now I'll turn it back to Bill.
Thanks, Molly. Let's start with the markets. In alumina, prices are up versus the first quarter, supplies currently tight, and there's a limited supply of low-carbon projects in the pipeline. The alumina price surged in the second quarter driven by several supply side disruptions and continued strong demand from smelters.
 Supply issues occurred in both China and the rest of the world. Chinese refineries curtailed capacity due to shortages of domestic bauxite amid continued environmental and safety inspections. In response, the volume and price of seaborne bauxite imports into China has increased this year.
 Outside of China, supply issues due to the Queensland force majeure in Eastern Australia reduced Indian aluminum exports and the Kwinana curtailment in Western Australia reduced supply. Demand increased the seasonally curtailed capacity in Yunnan province and China restarted, as well as some capacity in Europe that is still ramping up. All these factors contributed to making the spot market tight.
 In the longer term, we expect the demand for alumina to continue to grow in line with primary aluminum supply growth. However, there are supply challenges from both bauxite supply and refinery carbon footprint. Refining in China is likely to become more expensive over time.
 Chinese refineries are expected to increasingly rely on seaborne bauxite as their domestic resources deplete. In addition, a new policy was put in place this year to add energy efficiency standards for new domestic refineries requiring additional investor in time to ensure they meet the standards.
 Another potential supply challenge is the carbon footprint of the refinery projects in pipeline. For primary aluminum to be truly low carbon, it needs to be low carbon from mine to metal. We offer our low carbon EcoLum primary aluminum, which is produced with less than 4 tons of carbon dioxide equivalents per ton of aluminum produced, including Scope 1 and 2 emissions for mining, refining, smelting and casting.
 And the world's only low-carbon aluminum brand, EcoSource, which has a carbon footprint under 0.6 tons of CO2 per ton of alumina, including Scope 1 and 2 emissions from mining and refining. However, when considering likely alumina refinery projects, there are a few low carbon aluminum projects in the global pipeline and none that we expect to come online before 2030.
 Let's move to the aluminum market. In aluminum, prices have moved higher versus the first quarter, reflecting current market dynamics. On the supply side, there are limited new smelting projects in the near term, and China continues to hold through its 45 million ton annualized capacity cap.
 Some Chinese smelters have relocated to different provinces within China to fully utilize their capacity quotas. And as a direct result of the cap, some Chinese affiliated smelter projects have advanced outside of China in Indonesia and Angola. While supply growth has remained limited, global demand continues to increase year on year. This has kept global inventories at historically low levels.
 Digging deeper on demand. This year, several trade defense actions in North America and Europe have been implemented, which are likely to support demand in those regions. Overall, there is a strong recovery in the packaging segment. Electrical and transportation remains solid too, even the growth in the automotive segment has slowed in recent months, particularly in Europe.
 Building and construction remains the most challenged sector. However, the start of interest rate cutting in Europe and anticipated rate cuts in the US later this year could provide uplift for this sector.
 On the pricing side, regional premiums in the second quarter were up sequentially across North America, Europe and Asia likely driven by a combination of the US and UK sanctions against Russia metal in April and continued supply chain disruptions in the Red Sea.
 On the green aluminum front, we are excited to note that there are now low-carbon aluminum premium pricing indices available in Europe, North America and Asia, representing 90% of all aluminum demand outside of China. As a leading supplier of low-carbon aluminum, we believe these premium support our view that the demand for low-carbon products is rising.
 In the longer term, we see a bright future for aluminum. We remain convinced that the healthy long-term demand fixture with growth driven by society's transition towards a low carbon future, demand for low-carbon primary aluminum should grow steadily as aluminum users focus on meeting their decarbonization targets and minimizing their exposure to carbon emissions based import duties.
 While both overall and low-carbon aluminum demand are expected to grow, there is a shortlist of likely smelting projects coming online in the next 5 to 10 years with less than 25% of the projects in the next 5 years using renewable power. So in summary, both the alumina and aluminum markets are showing strength and our long-term outlook remains positive.
 Let's move to Alcoa specific topics, including our current operating performance and an exciting announcement for future operations related to ELYSIS. Whenever I visit our operating locations, we discuss three things: safety; stability and continuous improvement.
 Safety is a core Alcoa value. It is an indicator of process stability and a perfect place to focus on continuous improvement. We continue to evolve our safety programs and we judge performance based on leading indicators such as the roughly 8,300 critical control field verifications that we perform every month.
 Evidence of our improvement is also clear in our lagging safety indicators such as the DART and the recordables rates, which are both improving substantially year on year. It's no coincidence that many of our plants are setting production records.
 Our Canadian smelting system set a half year production record and the motion smelter in Norway set both a quarterly and half year production record. In fact, Alcoa's total aluminum production has increased for seven straight quarters starting in the fourth quarter of 2022. That's a sign of both stability and continuous improvement.
 Turning to a longer-term project, we recently announced further progress on the ELYSIS technology program. Our ELYSIS partner will build tons of production cells in Quebec using ELYSIS technology. Alcoa have offtake rights for up to 40% of the metal and Alcoa will produce and supply the anodes for the demonstration cells at its technology center near Pittsburgh.
 Alcoa will also benefit from the technology development that occurs in the project. We're excited for this first large-scale technology demonstration project to get underway and look forward to its successful startup by 2027.
 Finally, let me provide an update on two key areas of ongoing focus. Our profitability improvement programs and our San Ciprián improvements in sales processes. Six months ago, we provided a list of targeted actions to improve adjusted EBITDA by approximately $645 million by the end of 2025 compared to a 2023 baseline. To date, our year on year improvement has already met more than half the target and just under $300 million remains to be captured over the next 18 months.
 A large piece of the program, almost half, was raw materials cost savings, which includes materials such as caustic, coke and pitch. Thanks to our procurement team's good work and favorable markets, we are ahead of our raw material savings target. While the path is harder from here, we have already achieved three quarters of the raw materials target and expect to exceed it by year end.
 Progress is also being made on the other elements in the program. The productivity improvement program has captured $30 million in the year on year savings, about a third of its target. Warrick, thanks to its successful potline restart, has captured half of its $60 million internal target with another $30 million of its $90 million total dependent upon increased IRA funding. The Alumar smelter restart has captured a third of its target, and we are pleased with its increased operational stability.
 Finally, we are starting to see financial benefit of the full curtailment of the Kwinana refinery, although the full benefits are likely to be realized in 2025. So in total, we are pleased with our progress to date on our profitability improvement programs.
 The final near term improvement lever we outlined was finding a solution for San Ciprián. Our two-pronged approach has focused on improving the location's competitiveness and on pursuing a potential sale. Both the sale process and competitiveness improvement initiative rely on finding competitive energy for both the smelter and refinery.
 While electricity and gas prices are lower than the recent extreme highs, they're still not back in a row range that could be considered competitive. The Spanish government entities could be helpful on multiple fronts. On electricity costs, they could provide material CO2 compensation and eliminate the permitting denials and delays that have precluded availability of low-cost renewable power generation. Even with these challenges, we continue to work the sale process and aim to bring it to conclusion this year. But as noted earlier, a successful sale will depend on government and union support.
 Summing it up, we are close to finalizing the Alumina Limited acquisition. We are excited to welcome the Alumina Limited shareholders to Alcoa and firmly believe that this transaction will enhance our Alcoa's position as a leading pure-play upstream global aluminum company. It will provide Alumina Limited shareholders ASX listed global aluminum exposure and result in greater operational and financial flexibility and strategic optionality.
 Our safety and operational metrics are continuing to advance as we diligently progress our various improvement initiative. We have accomplished a lot, and we are targeting even more recent alone seminar in aluminum markets have been favorable. And we believe the mid and long term outlook for the aluminum industry is bright. It's a great time to be at Alcoa.
 With that, let's start the question and answer session.
(Operator Instructions) Carlos De Alba, Morgan Stanley.
Thank you very much and congratulations on the progress that you guys have made, Bill and Molly. So one question is on the pace of synergies, assuming that everything goes as expected in the transaction closes in early August, the synergies that you have laid out, how quickly can you realize what you expect to see that the pace of those new synergies once again the deal is closed?
 And my second question is related to the decision of Alcoa to not participate in the funding of the ELYSIS first plant -- industrial plant. I understand that you have the 40% right to -- the right to purchase 40% of the material. But what was the thought process fir not participating in investment?
Hi, Carlos. It's Molly. I'll take the first question and then Bill can take the second. On the synergies with Alumina Limited, we outlined that we would have overhead savings of $12 million, and that will start immediately. The other thing that we outlined is the capital allocation framework improvements that we expect to get, by able to place debt closer to the operations that need them, so within the jurisdictions where we can have a tax advantage. Now that will take time and we'll move our debt over a period of time, not immediately.
On the second question, Carlos. We believe the construct of the solution that we have on this first implementation of ELYSIS is a really smart construct. And the reason being is that they're implementing the 10 ELYSIS smelting pots at 100 KA at our vita. So it's a good testing ground for that size of the pod. At the same time, we will be building the anodes and cathodes at the technical center. So it's a good balance between the two partners.
 I really like the solution also because we have the option of taking 40% of the offtake. And so we will have access to the lowest carbon metal in the world once this is up and running. So very pleased with the way we structured this deal and looking forward to the success of this first implementation.
Great. Thanks very much. Good luck.
Thanks, Carlos,
Katja Jancic, BMO Capital Markets.
Hi, thank you for taking my question. Maybe near term Molly, you mentioned in the alumina segment, you will have an unfavorable impact from bauxite grade in Australia. Can you provide a little more color on that? I would assume that with Kwinana being shut down that could be less of an impact.
Katja, thanks for your question. What we are indicating with $10 million additional unfavorable cost related to the bauxite quality, we are seeing additional maintenance costs. We actually had been operating favorably in comparison to our original estimates on the bauxite quality impacts, higher caustic, higher energy, higher bauxite usage. But now we are starting to face some maintenance and so we are sorting the maintenance level that's going to be needed to run at a lower bauxite quality.
And maybe how should we think moving forward? Is this something that will continue, could there be incremental pressures?
We will give you additional guidance. Honestly, the teams are sorting that now. So between the maintenance teams and our center of excellence by working hard to determine what the proper spend level is.
Okay, thanks. I'll hop back into the queue.
Michael Dudas, Vertical Research.
Good morning, gentlemen, Molly. Bill, maybe can you share your thoughts on the aluminum market? You're obviously we've all the dynamics that's occurring, how does this environment compared to other environments you witnessed with spiking in capacity issues, is this something that a little bit more sustainability? Is there a price level cost pressure there could be impacted and how you're planning for those dynamics in your alumina business, especially as you bring on the folks from Australia?
So the aluminum -- the aluminum industry today is in a fairly unique situation. We exited the second quarter in a deficit to the tune of around globally for the industry, about a 3 million metric ton deficit. And for the full year, we're anticipating that alumina will be in deficit.
 So it's a situation that is very tight and we're seeing it around the world. The only way that deficit get solved, obviously is either smelters curtail or we get ramp-ups in alumina. There's really two things that drove that deficit in the near term. One was supply issues from some of our competitors, specifically in Northern Australia and China. So as we look forward that market only comes back in the balance if those supply issues are solved.
 As far as the second question is when we bring on the Alumina shareholders and whether this has any impact on our running of our operations, you can understand at these prices, we're pushing to get every ton out the door and trying to make sure that we gain the benefit of these higher prices. We will not have any significant operational changes associated with the acquisition since Alumina Limited was a 40% minority partner, but no operational changes there. Hope that answers your question, Michael?
It does Bill. And just quick follow-up. To regarding -- so with pricing, alumina spiking and some of the others issues you've talked about, is given where prices are, is there any suggestion that some smelters could curtail, especially since energy price kind of worked positive on the other ways, is any impact that could alleviate the market a bit you think?
It will depend on how long these prices persist. But clearly at $480 a ton, it will depend on what metal prices and ForEx, but it puts a lot of pressure on marginal smelters. So as I look around the world at the smelters that could be exposed to these higher prices and pressures associated with that, it would be in Southeast Asia and potentially the Middle East.
Thank you, Bill.
John Tumazos, John Tumazos Very Independent Research.
Thank you very much. With the Kwinana outage and the Queensland gas curtailments and world aluminum metal output up 3.4% in the first five months. Are there smelters that can't operate because they don't have alumina or are somehow work in process inventories or alumina and transit inventories getting used up?
So John, on the -- I think you're right in the near term on that question, we are seeing very tight inventories of alumina. The deficit that we saw in the second quarter of roughly 800,000 tons in a quarter, which for a full year basis is around 3 million metric tons, it really put a stress on inventory levels around the world.
 And to similar advance of the question similarly to what I answered with Michael, the areas of exposure for smelters and I should have also listed India, but it's really India, Southeast Asia and the Middle East that may be exposed to inability to get alumina. But at this point, we didn't see that in the second quarter. And it will depend on how long this deficit persists and whether there's a ramp-up associated with refining capacity.
With the second, possible questions. Thank you. If San Ciprián smelter and aluminum, were both off of your books, not the one-time charge or the severance, but how much would your alumina -- EBITDA improve every year with [spaying] off your books?
I think the closest that we've probably guided on that was the losses that we saw in 2023, which I will say them and then Molly will correct me, but I think it was approximately $150 million of EBITDA losses associated with the with the Spanish assets in 2023.
Thank you and congratulations on being profitable again.
Thanks, John.
Timna Tanners, Wolfe Research.
Great, thanks and good afternoon. Wanted to ask if you have any insights into or any updates on the latest regarding the remaining amount that you've been looking into for [45X] and any insights on to possible repeal, dial-back of the broader law, it's currently starting to get to be a hot topic and would be curious to any insights you have there?
So no insights on 45X at this point, we've clearly had dialogue with the administration. They understand how critically important 45X is to the US assets. I would reiterate and I've reiterated before, we're very appreciative of what they did around 45X on the first tranche, but including the second tranche would be important for the competitiveness of Massena and Warrick. What was your second question, Timna?
There's also some discussion of our broader repeal of IRA. So I don't know if that's on the same vein of what you were just addressing, but like 45X in particular in broader IRA.
Yeah. As far as a repeal of IRA, I've not heard anything with this current administration. Clearly, there's been some discussion in the Trump potential administration that they made repeal IRA, but we first have to see who will win the election in November and then what actions they'll take.
Totally fair. And then if I could, on the Spanish situation, if you were in our seat, how do you think about any exit costs? Is there a range of potential outcomes are how do think about budgeting or, you know, modeling for that by the end of the year when there will be a decision made?
Unfortunately, I can't give you a great answer, Timna. We are working down two work streams. The first is try to make the plan as competitive as we can. And as you well know, competitiveness for refinery and a smelter comes down largely to energy costs and energy solutions. So we're going down that path.
 The second path that we're going down is the sale process to give you a little color on the sale process. We had around six companies that showed an expression of interest. We'd narrowed that down to a subset of those companies, got a second round and are now in the process of going through a final round with a subset of those bidders. So we will see whether we can, come out with a successful solution on the sale process.
 If both of those work streams were to fail, the cash we believe will run out towards the end of the year. Obviously, that is dependent on what the market environment looks like, and we'll have to make some pretty hard decisions. I've made it clear since the beginning of the year, we're not willing to put cash into the entity. So some real hard decisions will have to be made there.
Okay, fair. I appreciate the color. Thanks again.
Thanks, Timna.
Alex Hacking, Citi.
Yeah, thanks. I guess two questions. First question would be for Molly. In your prepared remarks, you talked about options for de-leveraging, could you maybe lay out what's on the table there? And then secondly, just following up on San Ciprián, it's the fate of the smelter and the refinery tied together? Is there a world where you sell one and not the other? Is there a world where you close one or not the other? Just anything there would be helpful. Thanks.
So, Alex, on the first question on our delevering, we no longer have an externally stated net debt target, however, right now are at $1.9 billion, and that is higher than the levels that we were able to achieve in 2021 and 2022, right around $1.1 billion. So we do expect to delever. It will take us some time. We've done this in the past, but we expect to really to focus on getting back to the strong balance sheet. And that puts us in the best position for acting on future growth options.
As far as San Ciprián goes, I would not rule out any options, Alex. It is difficult to sell part of the plant because the plant is connected between the two and there would need to be incremental capital put in place to operate the two independently. So I think that makes it difficult to sell separately. But as far as your second questions about potential curtailment, I hate to speculate on where we could get to, but I wouldn't rule out any options at this point.
Okay. Thanks. Just a follow-up for Molly, if I could. Is that okay?
Yes.
I mean, in terms of delevering, I assume, free cash flow generation is option number one, right? But what else is potentially on the table? Asset sales or other things? I guess in your prepared remarks, you just said you're looking at options. So just curious what the options are?
Yeah, we have a number of things we're looking at. We do again, we are assuming a $390 million debt in Australia. So we have options, we want to look at placing debt there. We also are looking at options to delever elsewhere and our debt. What we want to do, Alex, to get a look at the cash flows through the end of the year and evaluate all our options based on the strength of those flows over the next quarter or two.
And if I could just add to that, when she referred to options, it's real the options of what debt to pay down where to have debt. It's not necessarily she wasn't signaling to you that there are options of vast asset sales is really looking at today's market prices and the fact that we typically take working capital down in the second half of the year, what our options she strategically looking at the options for where do we do delever, how do we delever, not necessarily the source of cash for delevering.
I got you. That's helpful clarification. Thank you so much.
Bill Peterson, JPMorgan.
Hi, Bill and Molly, this is Bennett on for Bill Peterson. San Ciprián being are able to give any context, you said the very-high level to the types of parties that have indicated interest so far?
It spans the gamut of financial and strategics and non-traditional. So the expressions of interest were really from a variety of different types of parties. We cast a very wide net when we started this process. We wanted to make sure that there was -- that we really look at every opportunity to ensure the viability of this site. So when we looked at selling of the asset, I think we send out memorandums information, memorandums to 60 I was going to say over 50, thanks, 60 or so parties, and the half a dozen that produce an expression of interest were across those three areas.
 Great. Thanks for that. And then one quick one on alumina. Wanted to get your thoughts on marginal cost support from Chinese refineries and whether this could be impacted over time, giving your points out potentially having to import more bauxite going forward?
 So it's very -- it's obviously a very fluid situation. And my view in our latest thinking is that marginal cost, whether that's in China or outside of China, probably approximate close to $400 a ton. Now that will depend on where it is, and what the caustic prices assumptions is and the currencies, but it's probably close to that.
Understood. Thank you very much.
Lucas Pipes, B. Riley.
Thank you very much, operator, good afternoon, everyone. My first question is on the cost side. So first on the vessel purchase in Brazil, the right way to think about it that it's about a $30 million annual cost saving. And then secondly, on slide 17, going back to the profitability improvement program and the [295], I think in your prepared remarks, you mentioned timing of when you went through the different buckets, it has been achieved kind of what percentage of achieved. But I wondered if you could maybe just speak to the [295] and what's the major components are that you're looking to realize? Thank you very much.
So first, the question on -- sorry I want to say (multiple speakers)
Anything certainly we call it Project Condor. It's on the vessels in Brazil.
Yeah. So on the ship purchases in Brazil, you're right. It's just over $30 million a year and savings for that effort.
And before you go onto the next part of the question, I want to make sure that people understand we're not going into the global shipping business. This was an opportunity where our cost structure was just fundamentally too high due to the market situation down in Brazil. While we tried to address that through market negotiations, we weren't able to get there. And that's why we've made this this strategic investment in these four vessels. I don't want our investors, or sell side analysts thinking that we are more broadly going into the shipping business. We are not, this is, as I've described internally, this is almost like having a conveyor belt, but it just happens to be on the water. All right, so go ahead Molly.
So on the improvement programs, a couple more points on the raw materials they aren't necessarily additional actions that we have to take. We are negotiating now and our purchase prices that we're seeing now are going to deliver the year-over-year improvement. Recall were on those lags and inventory. So the six months, in caustic and the three months on coke and pitch, so good line of sight to realize that with the contracts that we have in place now.
 As far as the productivity and competitiveness program, we have already identified list of hundreds of initiatives. They are being executed now. Internally we're tracking that against revised budget. Everyone across the company, all the budget managers have lost about 6% of our budgets. So they are adhering to those. And so that's how we are monitoring the $100 million our program there.
 As far as Warrick, they hit about half of their run rate already, and that's with improved cost absorption after their restart. And they do still have a series of initiatives to implement their for additional productivity. And then remember with Warrick, we also had the $30 million of IRA funding that we are waiting a word on there.
 On Alumar smelter, a similar story to work with them increasing their production, there cost absorption has already gotten about a third of their target, also improvement on the higher tons coming through. They are operating at just above 70% now. So we believe they're on track for the full year by the end of '25.
 And then Kwinana they are obviously completely down now. We are seeing -- some higher ramp down costs as well as higher initial holding costs. So for them they will -- they will get the full cost reduction, but it won't be until 2025. You'll see some minimal savings coming there in the second half of '24, but we won't hit that full run rate till '25.
Thank you very much for this. My second question is a clarification on the additional business considerations. You citing the unfavorable impact of higher alumina costs in the aluminum segment to the tune of $60 million. Is that over and above the usual sensitivity? Or how should we think about that $60 million? Thank you very much.
So that $60 million is not within your sensitivities that's why we give that to you separately. So obviously, the higher alumina prices going to benefit us overall dramatically. But then we call out for you how much of that will show up in the aluminum segment as an additional cost.
But there's nothing operationally that would drive those at higher costs. It's really just the price sensitivity.
Just the price. Correct, just the price.
Just the flow through. And we only provide that for you because some people struggle with the modeling. And so it allows you to clearly understand what the alumina cost is in the aluminum business. In effect, Lucas that's a number that would show up on the quarterly bridge in effect for the segment.
Very good. I appreciate that clarification. Thank you and best of luck.
And this concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Oplinger for any closing remarks.
Thank you. Just a couple of closing remarks. As you can see from the results, we made a lot of progress in the quarter. We improved both the safety and the operational -- operations across the company. We're about to close on the Alumina Limited transaction on August 1, and we've already captured over half of the improvement from the improvement programs that we're anticipating for 2025. So overall, it was a busy quarter and we made a lot of progress. I'd like to thank you for joining our call. Molly, and I look forward to sharing further progress when we speak again in October.
The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.
