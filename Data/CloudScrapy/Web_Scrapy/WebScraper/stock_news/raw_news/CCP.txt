Credit Corp Group (ASX:CCP) shareholders have endured a 1.5% loss from investing in the stock five years ago 2023-08-27T23:02:32.000Z

While not a mind-blowing move, it is good to see that the 
 (
) share price has gained 20% in the last three months. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last five years have been less than pleasing. You would have done a lot better buying an index fund, since the stock has dropped 13% in that half decade.
With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.
In his essay 
 Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.
Looking back five years, both Credit Corp Group's share price and EPS declined; the latter at a rate of 0.2% per year. This reduction in EPS is less than the 3% annual reduction in the share price. This implies that the market is more cautious about the business these days.
The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).
It is of course excellent to see how Credit Corp Group has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this

It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Credit Corp Group's TSR for the last 5 years was -1.5%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!
Credit Corp Group provided a TSR of 2.1% over the last twelve months. But that return falls short of the market. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it is certainly better than the yearly loss of about 0.3% endured over half a decade. So this might be a sign the business has turned its fortunes around.

Credit Corp Group (ASX:CCP) investors are sitting on a loss of 41% if they invested three years ago 2024-02-04T00:27:37.000Z

 (
) shareholders will doubtless be very grateful to see the share price up 44% in the last quarter. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last three years have been less than pleasing. In fact, the share price is down 46% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return.
So let's have a look and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.
While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.
Although the share price is down over three years, Credit Corp Group actually managed to grow EPS by 34% per year in that time. This is quite a puzzle, and suggests there might be something temporarily buoying the share price. Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.
Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.
We note that, in three years, revenue has actually grown at a 8.4% annual rate, so that doesn't seem to be a reason to sell shares. This analysis is just perfunctory, but it might be worth researching Credit Corp Group more closely, as sometimes stocks fall unfairly. This could present an opportunity.
You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).
We like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Credit Corp Group will 
.
As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Credit Corp Group the TSR over the last 3 years was -41%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the 
 shareholder return.
While the broader market gained around 6.4% in the last year, Credit Corp Group shareholders lost 20% (even including dividends). Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 1.3% per year over five years. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should "buy when there is blood on the streets", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

Institutions own 47% of Credit Corp Group Limited (ASX:CCP) shares but individual investors control 50% of the company 2024-05-08T20:02:15.000Z

A look at the shareholders of Credit Corp Group Limited (
) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are individual investors with 50% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.
Institutions, on the other hand, account for 47% of the company's stockholders. Institutions will often hold stock in bigger companies, and we expect to see insiders owning a noticeable percentage of the smaller ones.
Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Credit Corp Group, beginning with the chart below.
Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.
As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Credit Corp Group. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Credit Corp Group's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.
Hedge funds don't have many shares in Credit Corp Group. Bennelong Funds Management Group Pty Ltd is currently the largest shareholder, with 14% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.0% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.0% by the third-largest shareholder.
On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.
Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Credit Corp Group Limited. It has a market capitalization of just AU$1.1b, and insiders have AU$21m worth of shares, in their own names. This shows at least some alignment. You can 
The general public-- including retail investors -- own 50% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.
It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Credit Corp Group better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should learn about the

3 ASX Stocks Estimated To Be Below Market Value In June 2024 2024-06-20T19:08:02.000Z

In the past year, the Australian stock market has shown modest growth with a 6.7% increase, while maintaining stability over the last week. Given these conditions and expected future earnings growth, stocks that are currently undervalued may present particularly appealing opportunities for investors looking for potential gains in a growing market.
We're going to check out a few of the best picks from our screener tool
 Credit Corp Group Limited, operating in Australia and the United States, specializes in debt ledger purchase and collection as well as consumer lending services, with a market capitalization of approximately A$1.02 billion.
 Credit Corp Group's revenue is derived from debt ledger purchasing in the United States (A$40.32 million), Australia and New Zealand (A$235.28 million), and consumer lending across these regions plus the United States (A$164.48 million).
 37.3%
Credit Corp Group is currently trading at A$14.95, significantly below the estimated fair value of A$23.8, indicating a potential undervaluation based on discounted cash flows. While the company's earnings are expected to grow by 24.9% annually, outpacing the Australian market's average, its revenue growth forecast of 10.6% also exceeds the market expectation of 5.5%. However, challenges include a profit margin decrease from last year and dividends that are not well-covered by cash flows, reflecting some financial strain.
 Nickel Industries Limited is involved in the mining of nickel ore and the production of nickel pig iron and nickel matte, with a market capitalization of approximately A$3.66 billion.
 The company generates revenue through three primary segments: nickel ore mining in Indonesia contributing A$36.81 million, HPAL projects in Indonesia and Hong Kong totaling A$32.58 million, and RKEF projects across Indonesia and Singapore amounting to A$1.81 billion.
 13.6%
Nickel Industries is priced at A$0.86, below the estimated fair value of A$0.99, suggesting a modest undervaluation. The company's earnings are projected to grow significantly at 36.7% annually, outstripping the broader Australian market's growth rate. However, its dividend sustainability is questionable due to inadequate cash flow coverage and a recent increase in shareholder dilution, alongside lower profit margins compared to the previous year.
 Sandfire Resources Limited is a mining company focused on the exploration, evaluation, and development of mineral tenements and projects, with a market capitalization of approximately A$4.02 billion.
 The company generates revenue primarily from its MATSA Copper Operations and Degrussa Copper Operations, which collectively brought in approximately $676.24 million.
 37.2%
Sandfire Resources, priced at A$8.78, is considered undervalued against a fair value of A$13.96, reflecting a 37.1% discount. The company's revenue growth is expected to outpace the Australian market average at 15.3% annually versus 5.5%. While its return on equity might remain low at 9.8%, Sandfire's earnings are forecast to surge by nearly 60% per year over the next three years as it moves towards profitability, aligning with above-average market growth expectations.

 21.9%
Bell Financial Group, priced at A$1.4, is trading 21.9% below our fair value estimate of A$1.79, indicating a potential undervaluation based on discounted cash flows. Despite this, its dividend sustainability is questionable as both earnings and free cash flows do not adequately cover a 5% dividend yield. However, the company's earnings are expected to grow significantly by 26.95% annually over the next three years, outpacing the Australian market forecast of 13%. Revenue growth projections also exceed market averages at 5.6% per year compared to the market's 5.3%.
 Credit Corp Group Limited, with a market cap of A$952.94 million, operates in debt ledger purchase and collection as well as consumer lending services across Australia and the United States.

 44.7%
Credit Corp Group, priced at A$14, is trading well below its estimated fair value of A$25.31, suggesting significant undervaluation based on discounted cash flow analysis. While the company's debt isn't sufficiently covered by operating cash flows and its dividend coverage by free cash flows is weak, it shows promising financial prospects with earnings expected to rise by 24.92% annually over the next three years—outstripping the Australian market's average growth rate. However, its profit margins have declined from last year.
 IPH Limited, a firm operating globally including in Australia, New Zealand, Asia, and Canada, offers intellectual property services and products with a market capitalization of approximately A$1.53 billion.

 48.4%
IPH, priced at A$6.16, is significantly undervalued with a fair value estimate of A$11.94 based on discounted cash flow analysis. Despite its high level of debt and shareholder dilution over the past year, IPH's earnings are expected to grow by 15.5% annually, surpassing the Australian market's forecasted growth. The company recently extended its buyback plan and presented at the Macquarie Australia Conference, signaling ongoing strategic initiatives to enhance shareholder value.

Amidst this broader market retreat, certain stocks have demonstrated resilience or noteworthy performance, such as Tissue Repair and Newmont Corporation showing gains in challenging conditions.

The Australian stock market has shown positive momentum, rising 1.4% over the last week and achieving a 10% increase over the past year with earnings expected to grow by 13% annually.

Revenue growth projections also exceed market averages at 5.6% per year compared to the market's 5.3%.

Credit Corp Group (ASX:CCP) shareholders have endured a 1.5% loss from investing in the stock five years ago 2023-08-27T23:02:32.000Z

While not a mind-blowing move, it is good to see that the 
 (
) share price has gained 20% in the last three months. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last five years have been less than pleasing. You would have done a lot better buying an index fund, since the stock has dropped 13% in that half decade.
With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.
In his essay 
 Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.
Looking back five years, both Credit Corp Group's share price and EPS declined; the latter at a rate of 0.2% per year. This reduction in EPS is less than the 3% annual reduction in the share price. This implies that the market is more cautious about the business these days.
The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).
It is of course excellent to see how Credit Corp Group has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this 
 
.
It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Credit Corp Group's TSR for the last 5 years was -1.5%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!
Credit Corp Group provided a TSR of 2.1% over the last twelve months. But that return falls short of the market. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it is certainly better than the yearly loss of about 0.3% endured over half a decade. So this might be a sign the business has turned its fortunes around. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted

Credit Corp Group (ASX:CCP) investors are sitting on a loss of 41% if they invested three years ago 2024-02-04T00:27:37.000Z

 (
) shareholders will doubtless be very grateful to see the share price up 44% in the last quarter. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last three years have been less than pleasing. In fact, the share price is down 46% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return.
So let's have a look and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.
While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.
Although the share price is down over three years, Credit Corp Group actually managed to grow EPS by 34% per year in that time. This is quite a puzzle, and suggests there might be something temporarily buoying the share price. Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.
Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.
We note that, in three years, revenue has actually grown at a 8.4% annual rate, so that doesn't seem to be a reason to sell shares. This analysis is just perfunctory, but it might be worth researching Credit Corp Group more closely, as sometimes stocks fall unfairly. This could present an opportunity.
You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).
We like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Credit Corp Group will 
.
As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Credit Corp Group the TSR over the last 3 years was -41%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the 
 shareholder return.
While the broader market gained around 6.4% in the last year, Credit Corp Group shareholders lost 20% (even including dividends). Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 1.3% per year over five years. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should "buy when there is blood on the streets", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks, for example - Credit Corp Group has

Institutions own 47% of Credit Corp Group Limited (ASX:CCP) shares but individual investors control 50% of the company 2024-05-08T20:02:15.000Z

A look at the shareholders of Credit Corp Group Limited (
) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are individual investors with 50% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.
Institutions, on the other hand, account for 47% of the company's stockholders. Institutions will often hold stock in bigger companies, and we expect to see insiders owning a noticeable percentage of the smaller ones.
Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Credit Corp Group, beginning with the chart below.
Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.
As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Credit Corp Group. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Credit Corp Group's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.
Hedge funds don't have many shares in Credit Corp Group. Bennelong Funds Management Group Pty Ltd is currently the largest shareholder, with 14% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.0% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.0% by the third-largest shareholder.
On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.
Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Credit Corp Group Limited. It has a market capitalization of just AU$1.1b, and insiders have AU$21m worth of shares, in their own names. This shows at least some alignment. You can 
The general public-- including retail investors -- own 50% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.
It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Credit Corp Group better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should learn about the

3 ASX Stocks Estimated To Be Below Market Value In June 2024 2024-06-20T19:08:02.000Z

In the past year, the Australian stock market has shown modest growth with a 6.7% increase, while maintaining stability over the last week. Given these conditions and expected future earnings growth, stocks that are currently undervalued may present particularly appealing opportunities for investors looking for potential gains in a growing market.
We're going to check out a few of the best picks from our screener tool
 Credit Corp Group Limited, operating in Australia and the United States, specializes in debt ledger purchase and collection as well as consumer lending services, with a market capitalization of approximately A$1.02 billion.
 Credit Corp Group's revenue is derived from debt ledger purchasing in the United States (A$40.32 million), Australia and New Zealand (A$235.28 million), and consumer lending across these regions plus the United States (A$164.48 million).

However, challenges include a profit margin decrease from last year and dividends that are not well-covered by cash flows, reflecting some financial strain.
 Nickel Industries Limited is involved in the mining of nickel ore and the production of nickel pig iron and nickel matte, with a market capitalization of approximately A$3.66 billion.
 The company generates revenue through three primary segments: nickel ore mining in Indonesia contributing A$36.81 million, HPAL projects in Indonesia and Hong Kong totaling A$32.58 million, and RKEF projects across Indonesia and Singapore amounting to A$1.81 billion.

The company's earnings are projected to grow significantly at 36.7% annually, outstripping the broader Australian market's growth rate. However, its dividend sustainability is questionable due to inadequate cash flow coverage and a recent increase in shareholder dilution, alongside lower profit margins compared to the previous year.
 Sandfire Resources Limited is a mining company focused on the exploration, evaluation, and development of mineral tenements and projects, with a market capitalization of approximately A$4.02 billion.
 The company generates revenue primarily from its MATSA Copper Operations and Degrussa Copper Operations, which collectively brought in approximately $676.24 million.
 37.2%

The company's revenue growth is expected to outpace the Australian market average at 15.3% annually versus 5.5%. While its return on equity might remain low at 9.8%, Sandfire's earnings are forecast to surge by nearly 60% per year over the next three years as it moves towards profitability, aligning with above-average market growth expectations.

Credit Corp Group (ASX:CCP) Has Announced A Dividend Of A$0.23 2024-08-04T22:00:50.000Z

 (
) investors are due to receive a payment of A$0.23 per share on 27th of September. This payment takes the dividend yield to 2.4%, which only provides a modest boost to overall returns.
If it is predictable over a long period, even low dividend yields can be attractive. Based on the last payment, Credit Corp Group's earnings were much higher than the dividend, but it wasn't converting those earnings into cash flow. In general, we consider cash flow to be more important than earnings, so we would be cautious about relying on the sustainability of this dividend.
Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 120.6%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 24%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.
The company has a long dividend track record, but it doesn't look great with cuts in the past. Since 2014, the annual payment back then was A$0.37, compared to the most recent full-year payment of A$0.38. Its dividends have grown at less than 1% per annum over this time frame. We're glad to see the dividend has risen, but with a limited rate of growth and fluctuations in the payments the total shareholder return may be limited.
With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share is growing. Earnings per share has been sinking by 12% over the last five years. This steep decline can indicate that the business is going through a tough time, which could constrain its ability to pay a larger dividend each year in the future. On the bright side, earnings are predicted to gain some ground over the next year, but until this turns into a pattern we wouldn't be feeling too comfortable.
Overall, it's not great to see that the dividend has been cut, but this might be explained by the payments being a bit high previously. While Credit Corp Group is earning enough to cover the payments, the cash flows are lacking. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.
Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. For example, we've identified
