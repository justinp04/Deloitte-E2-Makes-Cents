HUB24 Limited's (ASX:HUB) largest shareholders are retail investors with 49% ownership, institutions own 38% 2023-08-07T01:57:58.000Z

A look at the shareholders of HUB24 Limited (
) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are retail investors with 49% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
Meanwhile, institutions make up 38% of the company’s shareholders. Insiders often own a large chunk of younger, smaller, companies while huge companies tend to have institutions as shareholders.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of HUB24.
Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.
We can see that HUB24 does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see HUB24's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
Hedge funds don't have many shares in HUB24. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Hyperion Asset Management Limited with 9.1% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 5.9% and 5.0% of the stock. Furthermore, CEO Andrew Alcock is the owner of 1.3% of the company's shares.
On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.
While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
We can see that insiders own shares in HUB24 Limited. This is a big company, so it is good to see this level of alignment. Insiders own AU$133m worth of shares (at current prices). If you would like to explore the question of insider alignment, you can 
The general public-- including retail investors -- own 49% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.
With a stake of 5.9%, private equity firms could influence the HUB24 board. Sometimes we see private equity stick around for the long term, but generally speaking they have a shorter investment horizon and -- as the name suggests -- don't invest in public companies much. After some time they may look to sell and redeploy capital elsewhere.
I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the

HUB24 Full Year 2023 Earnings: EPS Beats Expectations 2023-08-22T20:16:34.000Z

Revenue was in line with analyst estimates. Earnings per share (EPS) surpassed analyst estimates by 5.6%.
Looking ahead, revenue is forecast to grow 13% p.a. on average during the next 3 years, compared to a 3.0% growth forecast for the Capital Markets industry in Australia.
The company's shares are up 14% from a week ago.
Our analysis of these results suggests HUB24 may be overvalued based on 6 important criteria we look at. 
 
================================================================================

The total return for HUB24 (ASX:HUB) investors has risen faster than earnings growth over the last five years 2023-10-23T01:48:33.000Z

The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can 
 more than 100%. One great example is 
 (
) which saw its share price drive 186% higher over five years. It's also good to see the share price up 18% over the last quarter.
Although HUB24 has shed AU$159m from its market cap this week, let's take a look at its longer term fundamental trends and see if they've driven returns.
While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.
Over half a decade, HUB24 managed to grow its earnings per share at 31% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 23% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days. Of course, with a P/E ratio of 67.23, the market remains optimistic.
The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).
We know that HUB24 has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this 
 
.
When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between 
 (TSR) and 
. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, HUB24's TSR for the last 5 years was 196%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!
It's nice to see that HUB24 shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 34% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 24%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Even so, be aware that 
, you should know about...
But note: 
. So take a peek at this 
 
 
================================================================================

We Take A Look At Why HUB24 Limited's (ASX:HUB) CEO Compensation Is Well Earned 2023-11-09T20:15:52.000Z

The performance at 
 (
) has been quite strong recently and CEO Andrew Alcock has played a role in it. Coming up to the next AGM on 16th of November, shareholders would be keeping this in mind. It is likely that the focus will be on company strategy going forward as shareholders hear from the board and cast their votes on resolutions such as executive remuneration and other matters. In light of the great performance, we discuss the case why we think CEO compensation is not excessive.
Our data indicates that HUB24 Limited has a market capitalization of AU$2.7b, and total annual CEO compensation was reported as AU$3.5m for the year to June 2023. That's mostly flat as compared to the prior year's compensation. While we always look at total compensation first, our analysis shows that the salary component is less, at AU$676k.
On comparing similar companies from the 
 with market caps ranging from AU$1.6b to AU$5.0b, we found that the median CEO total compensation was AU$3.2m. So it looks like HUB24 compensates Andrew Alcock in line with the median for the industry. What's more, Andrew Alcock holds AU$36m worth of shares in the company in their own name, indicating that they have a lot of skin in the game.
On an industry level, around 65% of total compensation represents salary and 35% is other remuneration. HUB24 pays a modest slice of remuneration through salary, as compared to the broader industry. It's important to note that a slant towards non-salary compensation suggests that total pay is tied to the company's performance.
Over the past three years, HUB24 Limited has seen its earnings per share (EPS) grow by 50% per year. In the last year, its revenue is up 45%.
Overall this is a positive result for shareholders, showing that the company has improved in recent years. It's great to see that revenue growth is strong, too. These metrics suggest the business is growing strongly. Looking ahead, you might want to check 
.
We think that the total shareholder return of 54%, over three years, would leave most HUB24 Limited shareholders smiling. As a result, some may believe the CEO should be paid more than is normal for companies of similar size.
Seeing that the company has put in a relatively good performance, the CEO remuneration policy may not be the focus at the AGM. In fact, strategic decisions that could impact the future of the business might be a far more interesting topic for investors as it would help them set their longer-term expectations.
While it is important to pay attention to CEO remuneration, investors should also consider other elements of the business. That's why we did some digging and identified 
 that you should be aware of before investing.
Switching gears from HUB24, if you're hunting for a pristine balance sheet and premium returns, this

Here's Why We Think HUB24 (ASX:HUB) Is Well Worth Watching 2023-12-19T05:08:50.000Z

For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.
In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like 
 (ASX:HUB), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide HUB24 with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.
Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. To the delight of shareholders, HUB24 has achieved impressive annual EPS growth of 50%, compound, over the last three years. That sort of growth rarely ever lasts long, but it is well worth paying attention to when it happens.
Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. HUB24 maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 45% to AU$278m. That's progress.
In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.
The trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are 
 perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for HUB24's future EPS 100% free.
It's pleasing to see company leaders with putting their money on the line, so to speak, because it increases alignment of incentives between the people running the business, and its true owners. Shareholders will be pleased by the fact that insiders own HUB24 shares worth a considerable sum. With a whopping AU$142m worth of shares as a group, insiders have plenty riding on the company's success. This should keep them focused on creating long term value for shareholders.
HUB24's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. This level of EPS growth does wonders for attracting investment, and the large insider investment in the company is just the cherry on top. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So at the surface level, HUB24 is worth putting on your watchlist; after all, shareholders do well when the market underestimates fast growing companies. One of Buffett's considerations when discussing businesses is if they are capital light or capital intensive. Generally, a company with a high return on equity is capital light, and can thus fund growth more easily. So you might want to check this graph comparing HUB24's ROE with industry peers (and the market at large).
There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that

Individual investors who hold 46% of HUB24 Limited (ASX:HUB) gained 3.0%, institutions profited as well 2024-01-15T21:32:13.000Z

To get a sense of who is truly in control of HUB24 Limited (ASX:HUB), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 46% to be precise, is individual investors. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).
While individual investors were the group that reaped the most benefits after last week’s 3.0% price gain, institutions also received a 43% cut.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of HUB24.
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in HUB24. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at HUB24's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.
We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in HUB24. Our data shows that Hyperion Asset Management Limited is the largest shareholder with 8.4% of shares outstanding. Pinnacle Investment Management Group Limited is the second largest shareholder owning 7.9% of common stock, and Thorney Investment Group Australia Pty. Ltd. holds about 5.9% of the company stock. In addition, we found that Andrew Alcock, the CEO has 1.3% of the shares allocated to their name.
Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 19 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.
Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.
We can report that insiders do own shares in HUB24 Limited. It is a pretty big company, so it is generally a positive to see some potentially meaningful alignment. In this case, they own around AU$152m worth of shares (at current prices). If you would like to explore the question of insider alignment, you can click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling.
The general public-- including retail investors -- own 46% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.
With a stake of 5.9%, private equity firms could influence the HUB24 board. Some investors might be encouraged by this, since private equity are sometimes able to encourage strategies that help the market see the value in the company. Alternatively, those holders might be exiting the investment after taking it public.
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

Investors in HUB24 (ASX:HUB) have seen stellar returns of 203% over the past five years 2024-04-01T01:00:28.000Z

The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can 
 more than 100%. For instance, the price of 
 (
) stock is up an impressive 193% over the last five years. On top of that, the share price is up 18% in about a quarter.
So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns.
While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.
During five years of share price growth, HUB24 achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 32% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 24% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days. Of course, with a P/E ratio of 77.85, the market remains optimistic.
You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).
We know that HUB24 has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our

When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between 
 (TSR) and 
. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of HUB24, it has a TSR of 203% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the 
 shareholder return.
It's good to see that HUB24 has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 56% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 25%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity.

Is Now The Time To Put HUB24 (ASX:HUB) On Your Watchlist? 2024-05-27T22:56:45.000Z

The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.
Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like 
 (
). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.
The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. To the delight of shareholders, HUB24 has achieved impressive annual EPS growth of 55%, compound, over the last three years. While that sort of growth rate isn't sustainable for long, it certainly catches the eye of prospective investors.
Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Not all of HUB24's revenue this year is revenue 
, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers used in this article might not be the best representation of the underlying business. While we note HUB24 achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 20% to AU$296m. That's progress.
You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image.
Fortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of HUB24's 
 profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can 
.
It should give investors a sense of security owning shares in a company if insiders also own shares, creating a close alignment their interests. Shareholders will be pleased by the fact that insiders own HUB24 shares worth a considerable sum. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth AU$172m. This suggests that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions!
HUB24's earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. This level of EPS growth does wonders for attracting investment, and the large insider investment in the company is just the cherry on top. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. Based on the sum of its parts, we definitely think its worth watching HUB24 very closely. Of course, profit growth is one thing but it's even better if HUB24 is receiving high returns on equity, since that should imply it can keep growing without much need for capital. 
While opting for stocks without growing earnings and absent insider buying can yield results, for investors valuing these key metrics, here is

), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 47% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.
Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about HUB24.
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
HUB24 already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of HUB24, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.
HUB24 is not owned by hedge funds. Hyperion Asset Management Limited is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.4% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.9% and 5.9%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. Furthermore, CEO Andrew Alcock is the owner of 1.3% of the company's shares.
After doing some more digging, we found that the top 13 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.
I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.
Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in HUB24 Limited. It is a pretty big company, so it is generally a positive to see some potentially meaningful alignment. In this case, they own around AU$188m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see this level of investment by insiders. You can 
With a 41% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over HUB24. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.
Private equity firms hold a 5.9% stake in HUB24. This suggests they can be influential in key policy decisions. Some might like this, because private equity are sometimes activists who hold management accountable. But other times, private equity is selling out, having taking the company public.
It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand HUB24 better, we need to consider many other factors.

HUB24 Limited's (ASX:HUB) largest shareholders are retail investors with 49% ownership, institutions own 38% 2023-08-07T01:57:58.000Z

A look at the shareholders of HUB24 Limited (
) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are retail investors with 49% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
Meanwhile, institutions make up 38% of the company’s shareholders. Insiders often own a large chunk of younger, smaller, companies while huge companies tend to have institutions as shareholders.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of HUB24.
Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.
We can see that HUB24 does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see HUB24's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
Hedge funds don't have many shares in HUB24. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Hyperion Asset Management Limited with 9.1% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 5.9% and 5.0% of the stock. Furthermore, CEO Andrew Alcock is the owner of 1.3% of the company's shares.
On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.
While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
We can see that insiders own shares in HUB24 Limited. This is a big company, so it is good to see this level of alignment. Insiders own AU$133m worth of shares (at current prices). If you would like to explore the question of insider alignment, you can 
The general public-- including retail investors -- own 49% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.
With a stake of 5.9%, private equity firms could influence the HUB24 board. Sometimes we see private equity stick around for the long term, but generally speaking they have a shorter investment horizon and -- as the name suggests -- don't invest in public companies much. After some time they may look to sell and redeploy capital elsewhere.
I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the

If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check

HUB24 Full Year 2023 Earnings: EPS Beats Expectations 2023-08-22T20:16:34.000Z

Revenue was in line with analyst estimates. Earnings per share (EPS) surpassed analyst estimates by 5.6%.
Looking ahead, revenue is forecast to grow 13% p.a. on average during the next 3 years, compared to a 3.0% growth forecast for the Capital Markets industry in Australia.
The company's shares are up 14% from a week ago.
Our analysis of these results suggests HUB24 may be overvalued based on 6 important criteria we look at. 
 
================================================================================

The total return for HUB24 (ASX:HUB) investors has risen faster than earnings growth over the last five years 2023-10-23T01:48:33.000Z

The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can 
 more than 100%. One great example is 
 (
) which saw its share price drive 186% higher over five years. It's also good to see the share price up 18% over the last quarter.
Although HUB24 has shed AU$159m from its market cap this week, let's take a look at its longer term fundamental trends and see if they've driven returns.
While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.
Over half a decade, HUB24 managed to grow its earnings per share at 31% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 23% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days. Of course, with a P/E ratio of 67.23, the market remains optimistic.
The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).
We know that HUB24 has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this 
 
.
When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between 
 (TSR) and 
. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, HUB24's TSR for the last 5 years was 196%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!
It's nice to see that HUB24 shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 34% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 24%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Even so, be aware that 
, you should know about...
But note: 
. So take a peek at this

We Take A Look At Why HUB24 Limited's (ASX:HUB) CEO Compensation Is Well Earned 2023-11-09T20:15:52.000Z

The performance at 
 (
) has been quite strong recently and CEO Andrew Alcock has played a role in it. Coming up to the next AGM on 16th of November, shareholders would be keeping this in mind. It is likely that the focus will be on company strategy going forward as shareholders hear from the board and cast their votes on resolutions such as executive remuneration and other matters. In light of the great performance, we discuss the case why we think CEO compensation is not excessive.
Our data indicates that HUB24 Limited has a market capitalization of AU$2.7b, and total annual CEO compensation was reported as AU$3.5m for the year to June 2023. That's mostly flat as compared to the prior year's compensation. While we always look at total compensation first, our analysis shows that the salary component is less, at AU$676k.
On comparing similar companies from the 
 with market caps ranging from AU$1.6b to AU$5.0b, we found that the median CEO total compensation was AU$3.2m. So it looks like HUB24 compensates Andrew Alcock in line with the median for the industry. What's more, Andrew Alcock holds AU$36m worth of shares in the company in their own name, indicating that they have a lot of skin in the game.
On an industry level, around 65% of total compensation represents salary and 35% is other remuneration. HUB24 pays a modest slice of remuneration through salary, as compared to the broader industry. It's important to note that a slant towards non-salary compensation suggests that total pay is tied to the company's performance.
Over the past three years, HUB24 Limited has seen its earnings per share (EPS) grow by 50% per year. In the last year, its revenue is up 45%.
Overall this is a positive result for shareholders, showing that the company has improved in recent years. It's great to see that revenue growth is strong, too. These metrics suggest the business is growing strongly. Looking ahead, you might want to check 
.
We think that the total shareholder return of 54%, over three years, would leave most HUB24 Limited shareholders smiling. As a result, some may believe the CEO should be paid more than is normal for companies of similar size.
Seeing that the company has put in a relatively good performance, the CEO remuneration policy may not be the focus at the AGM. In fact, strategic decisions that could impact the future of the business might be a far more interesting topic for investors as it would help them set their longer-term expectations.
While it is important to pay attention to CEO remuneration, investors should also consider other elements of the business. That's why we did some digging and identified 
 that you should be aware of before investing.
Switching gears from HUB24, if you're hunting for a pristine balance sheet and premium returns, this

Here's Why We Think HUB24 (ASX:HUB) Is Well Worth Watching 2023-12-19T05:08:50.000Z

For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.
In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like 
 (ASX:HUB), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide HUB24 with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.
Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. To the delight of shareholders, HUB24 has achieved impressive annual EPS growth of 50%, compound, over the last three years. That sort of growth rarely ever lasts long, but it is well worth paying attention to when it happens.
Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. HUB24 maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 45% to AU$278m. That's progress.
In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.
The trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are 
 perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for HUB24's future EPS 100% free.
It's pleasing to see company leaders with putting their money on the line, so to speak, because it increases alignment of incentives between the people running the business, and its true owners. Shareholders will be pleased by the fact that insiders own HUB24 shares worth a considerable sum. With a whopping AU$142m worth of shares as a group, insiders have plenty riding on the company's success. This should keep them focused on creating long term value for shareholders.
HUB24's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. This level of EPS growth does wonders for attracting investment, and the large insider investment in the company is just the cherry on top. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So at the surface level, HUB24 is worth putting on your watchlist; after all, shareholders do well when the market underestimates fast growing companies. One of Buffett's considerations when discussing businesses is if they are capital light or capital intensive. Generally, a company with a high return on equity is capital light, and can thus fund growth more easily. So you might want to check this graph comparing HUB24's ROE with industry peers (and the market at large).
There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that

Individual investors who hold 46% of HUB24 Limited (ASX:HUB) gained 3.0%, institutions profited as well 2024-01-15T21:32:13.000Z

To get a sense of who is truly in control of HUB24 Limited (ASX:HUB), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 46% to be precise, is individual investors. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).
While individual investors were the group that reaped the most benefits after last week’s 3.0% price gain, institutions also received a 43% cut.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of HUB24.
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in HUB24. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at HUB24's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.
We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in HUB24. Our data shows that Hyperion Asset Management Limited is the largest shareholder with 8.4% of shares outstanding. Pinnacle Investment Management Group Limited is the second largest shareholder owning 7.9% of common stock, and Thorney Investment Group Australia Pty. Ltd. holds about 5.9% of the company stock. In addition, we found that Andrew Alcock, the CEO has 1.3% of the shares allocated to their name.
Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 19 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.
Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.
We can report that insiders do own shares in HUB24 Limited. It is a pretty big company, so it is generally a positive to see some potentially meaningful alignment. In this case, they own around AU$152m worth of shares (at current prices). If you would like to explore the question of insider alignment, you can click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling.
The general public-- including retail investors -- own 46% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.
With a stake of 5.9%, private equity firms could influence the HUB24 board. Some investors might be encouraged by this, since private equity are sometimes able to encourage strategies that help the market see the value in the company. Alternatively, those holders might be exiting the investment after taking it public.
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

Investors in HUB24 (ASX:HUB) have seen stellar returns of 203% over the past five years 2024-04-01T01:00:28.000Z

The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can 
 more than 100%. For instance, the price of 
 (
) stock is up an impressive 193% over the last five years. On top of that, the share price is up 18% in about a quarter.
So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns.
While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.
During five years of share price growth, HUB24 achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 32% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 24% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days. Of course, with a P/E ratio of 77.85, the market remains optimistic.
You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).
We know that HUB24 has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our 
 
.
When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between 
 (TSR) and 
. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of HUB24, it has a TSR of 203% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the 
 shareholder return.
It's good to see that HUB24 has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 56% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 25%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity.

Is Now The Time To Put HUB24 (ASX:HUB) On Your Watchlist? 2024-05-27T22:56:45.000Z

The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.
Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like 
 (
). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.
The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. To the delight of shareholders, HUB24 has achieved impressive annual EPS growth of 55%, compound, over the last three years. While that sort of growth rate isn't sustainable for long, it certainly catches the eye of prospective investors.
Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Not all of HUB24's revenue this year is revenue 
, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers used in this article might not be the best representation of the underlying business. While we note HUB24 achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 20% to AU$296m. That's progress.
You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image.
Fortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of HUB24's 
 profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can 
.
It should give investors a sense of security owning shares in a company if insiders also own shares, creating a close alignment their interests. Shareholders will be pleased by the fact that insiders own HUB24 shares worth a considerable sum. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth AU$172m. This suggests that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions!
HUB24's earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. This level of EPS growth does wonders for attracting investment, and the large insider investment in the company is just the cherry on top. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. Based on the sum of its parts, we definitely think its worth watching HUB24 very closely. Of course, profit growth is one thing but it's even better if HUB24 is receiving high returns on equity, since that should imply it can keep growing without much need for capital. 
While opting for stocks without growing earnings and absent insider buying can yield results, for investors valuing these key metrics, here is

Owning 47% shares,institutional owners seem interested in HUB24 Limited (ASX:HUB), 2024-06-24T02:20:50.000Z

If you want to know who really controls HUB24 Limited (
), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 47% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.
Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about HUB24.
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
HUB24 already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of HUB24, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.
HUB24 is not owned by hedge funds. Hyperion Asset Management Limited is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.4% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.9% and 5.9%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. Furthermore, CEO Andrew Alcock is the owner of 1.3% of the company's shares.
After doing some more digging, we found that the top 13 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.
I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.
Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in HUB24 Limited. It is a pretty big company, so it is generally a positive to see some potentially meaningful alignment. In this case, they own around AU$188m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see this level of investment by insiders. You can 
With a 41% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over HUB24. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.
Private equity firms hold a 5.9% stake in HUB24. This suggests they can be influential in key policy decisions. Some might like this, because private equity are sometimes activists who hold management accountable. But other times, private equity is selling out, having taking the company public.
It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand HUB24 better, we need to consider many other factors.

HUB24 Full Year 2023 Earnings: EPS Beats Expectations 2023-08-22T20:16:34.000Z

Revenue was in line with analyst estimates. Earnings per share (EPS) surpassed analyst estimates by 5.6%.
Looking ahead, revenue is forecast to grow 13% p.a. on average during the next 3 years, compared to a 3.0% growth forecast for the Capital Markets industry in Australia.
The company's shares are up 14% from a week ago.
Our analysis of these results suggests HUB24 may be overvalued based on 6 important criteria we look at. 
 
================================================================================

The total return for HUB24 (ASX:HUB) investors has risen faster than earnings growth over the last five years 2023-10-23T01:48:33.000Z

The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can 
 more than 100%. One great example is 
 (
) which saw its share price drive 186% higher over five years. It's also good to see the share price up 18% over the last quarter.
Although HUB24 has shed AU$159m from its market cap this week, let's take a look at its longer term fundamental trends and see if they've driven returns.
While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.
Over half a decade, HUB24 managed to grow its earnings per share at 31% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 23% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days. Of course, with a P/E ratio of 67.23, the market remains optimistic.
The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).
We know that HUB24 has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this 
 
.
When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between 
 (TSR) and 
. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, HUB24's TSR for the last 5 years was 196%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!
It's nice to see that HUB24 shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 34% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 24%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Even so, be aware that 
, you should know about...
But note: 
. So take a peek at this 
 
 
================================================================================

We Take A Look At Why HUB24 Limited's (ASX:HUB) CEO Compensation Is Well Earned 2023-11-09T20:15:52.000Z

The performance at 
 (
) has been quite strong recently and CEO Andrew Alcock has played a role in it. Coming up to the next AGM on 16th of November, shareholders would be keeping this in mind. It is likely that the focus will be on company strategy going forward as shareholders hear from the board and cast their votes on resolutions such as executive remuneration and other matters. In light of the great performance, we discuss the case why we think CEO compensation is not excessive.
Our data indicates that HUB24 Limited has a market capitalization of AU$2.7b, and total annual CEO compensation was reported as AU$3.5m for the year to June 2023. That's mostly flat as compared to the prior year's compensation. While we always look at total compensation first, our analysis shows that the salary component is less, at AU$676k.
On comparing similar companies from the 
 with market caps ranging from AU$1.6b to AU$5.0b, we found that the median CEO total compensation was AU$3.2m. So it looks like HUB24 compensates Andrew Alcock in line with the median for the industry. What's more, Andrew Alcock holds AU$36m worth of shares in the company in their own name, indicating that they have a lot of skin in the game.
On an industry level, around 65% of total compensation represents salary and 35% is other remuneration. HUB24 pays a modest slice of remuneration through salary, as compared to the broader industry. It's important to note that a slant towards non-salary compensation suggests that total pay is tied to the company's performance.
Over the past three years, HUB24 Limited has seen its earnings per share (EPS) grow by 50% per year. In the last year, its revenue is up 45%.
Overall this is a positive result for shareholders, showing that the company has improved in recent years. It's great to see that revenue growth is strong, too. These metrics suggest the business is growing strongly. Looking ahead, you might want to check 
.
We think that the total shareholder return of 54%, over three years, would leave most HUB24 Limited shareholders smiling. As a result, some may believe the CEO should be paid more than is normal for companies of similar size.
Seeing that the company has put in a relatively good performance, the CEO remuneration policy may not be the focus at the AGM. In fact, strategic decisions that could impact the future of the business might be a far more interesting topic for investors as it would help them set their longer-term expectations.
While it is important to pay attention to CEO remuneration, investors should also consider other elements of the business. That's why we did some digging and identified 
 that you should be aware of before investing.
Switching gears from HUB24, if you're hunting for a pristine balance sheet and premium returns, this

Here's Why We Think HUB24 (ASX:HUB) Is Well Worth Watching 2023-12-19T05:08:50.000Z

For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.
In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like 
 (ASX:HUB), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide HUB24 with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.
Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. To the delight of shareholders, HUB24 has achieved impressive annual EPS growth of 50%, compound, over the last three years. That sort of growth rarely ever lasts long, but it is well worth paying attention to when it happens.
Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. HUB24 maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 45% to AU$278m. That's progress.
In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.
The trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are 
 perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for HUB24's future EPS 100% free.
It's pleasing to see company leaders with putting their money on the line, so to speak, because it increases alignment of incentives between the people running the business, and its true owners. Shareholders will be pleased by the fact that insiders own HUB24 shares worth a considerable sum. With a whopping AU$142m worth of shares as a group, insiders have plenty riding on the company's success. This should keep them focused on creating long term value for shareholders.
HUB24's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. This level of EPS growth does wonders for attracting investment, and the large insider investment in the company is just the cherry on top. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So at the surface level, HUB24 is worth putting on your watchlist; after all, shareholders do well when the market underestimates fast growing companies. One of Buffett's considerations when discussing businesses is if they are capital light or capital intensive. Generally, a company with a high return on equity is capital light, and can thus fund growth more easily. So you might want to check this graph comparing HUB24's ROE with industry peers (and the market at large).
There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that

 have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that

Individual investors who hold 46% of HUB24 Limited (ASX:HUB) gained 3.0%, institutions profited as well 2024-01-15T21:32:13.000Z

To get a sense of who is truly in control of HUB24 Limited (ASX:HUB), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 46% to be precise, is individual investors. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).
While individual investors were the group that reaped the most benefits after last week’s 3.0% price gain, institutions also received a 43% cut.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of HUB24.
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in HUB24. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at HUB24's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.
We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in HUB24. Our data shows that Hyperion Asset Management Limited is the largest shareholder with 8.4% of shares outstanding. Pinnacle Investment Management Group Limited is the second largest shareholder owning 7.9% of common stock, and Thorney Investment Group Australia Pty. Ltd. holds about 5.9% of the company stock. In addition, we found that Andrew Alcock, the CEO has 1.3% of the shares allocated to their name.
Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 19 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.
Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.
We can report that insiders do own shares in HUB24 Limited. It is a pretty big company, so it is generally a positive to see some potentially meaningful alignment. In this case, they own around AU$152m worth of shares (at current prices). If you would like to explore the question of insider alignment, you can click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling.
The general public-- including retail investors -- own 46% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.
With a stake of 5.9%, private equity firms could influence the HUB24 board. Some investors might be encouraged by this, since private equity are sometimes able to encourage strategies that help the market see the value in the company. Alternatively, those holders might be exiting the investment after taking it public.
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

Investors in HUB24 (ASX:HUB) have seen stellar returns of 203% over the past five years 2024-04-01T01:00:28.000Z

The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can 
 more than 100%. For instance, the price of 
 (
) stock is up an impressive 193% over the last five years. On top of that, the share price is up 18% in about a quarter.
So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns.
While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.
During five years of share price growth, HUB24 achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 32% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 24% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days. Of course, with a P/E ratio of 77.85, the market remains optimistic.
You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).
We know that HUB24 has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our 
 
.
When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between 
 (TSR) and 
. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of HUB24, it has a TSR of 203% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the 
 shareholder return.
It's good to see that HUB24 has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 56% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 25%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. Most investors take the time to check the data on insider transactions. You can

Is Now The Time To Put HUB24 (ASX:HUB) On Your Watchlist? 2024-05-27T22:56:45.000Z

The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.
Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like 
 (
). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.
The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. To the delight of shareholders, HUB24 has achieved impressive annual EPS growth of 55%, compound, over the last three years. While that sort of growth rate isn't sustainable for long, it certainly catches the eye of prospective investors.
Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Not all of HUB24's revenue this year is revenue 
, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers used in this article might not be the best representation of the underlying business. While we note HUB24 achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 20% to AU$296m. That's progress.

It should give investors a sense of security owning shares in a company if insiders also own shares, creating a close alignment their interests. Shareholders will be pleased by the fact that insiders own HUB24 shares worth a considerable sum. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth AU$172m. This suggests that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions!
HUB24's earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. This level of EPS growth does wonders for attracting investment, and the large insider investment in the company is just the cherry on top. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. Based on the sum of its parts, we definitely think its worth watching HUB24 very closely. Of course, profit growth is one thing but it's even better if HUB24 is receiving high returns on equity, since that should imply it can keep growing without much need for capital. 
While opting for stocks without growing earnings and absent insider buying can yield results, for investors valuing these key metrics, here is

Owning 47% shares,institutional owners seem interested in HUB24 Limited (ASX:HUB), 2024-06-24T02:20:50.000Z

If you want to know who really controls HUB24 Limited (
), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 47% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.
Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about HUB24.
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
HUB24 already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of HUB24, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.
HUB24 is not owned by hedge funds. Hyperion Asset Management Limited is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.4% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.9% and 5.9%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. Furthermore, CEO Andrew Alcock is the owner of 1.3% of the company's shares.
After doing some more digging, we found that the top 13 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.
I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.
Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in HUB24 Limited. It is a pretty big company, so it is generally a positive to see some potentially meaningful alignment. In this case, they own around AU$188m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see this level of investment by insiders. You can 
With a 41% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over HUB24. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.
Private equity firms hold a 5.9% stake in HUB24. This suggests they can be influential in key policy decisions. Some might like this, because private equity are sometimes activists who hold management accountable. But other times, private equity is selling out, having taking the company public.
It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand HUB24 better, we need to consider many other factors.
