Rare-earths miner Lynas' Q2 revenue halves on falling prices, lower China demand 2024-01-22T01:49:50.000Z

By Rishav Chatterjee and Melanie Burton
MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia's Lynas Rare Earths said on Monday its second-quarter revenue fell sharply, missing analysts' estimates, as prices plunged during a slowdown in construction activity in China, sending its shares to 30-month lows.
Rare earth prices during the quarter extended declines as demand in China, especially in the country's appliance sector, fell with the construction downturn, said Lynas, the world's largest producer of rare-earths outside China.
The miner said its sales fell 51.7% to A$112.5 million ($74.06 million) in the three months to Dec. 31, from A$232.7 million in the year-ago period. It missed Macquarie's estimate of A$117.8 million.
"(The) major issue for the company at present is the commodity price trajectory and demand in China," said analyst Dan Morgan of Barrenjoey.
"There wasn't anything positive the company said on demand to change the prevailing market mood."
Lynas said it has largely completed construction at its Kalgoorlie rare earths processing plant, which will also feed mixed rare earth carbonate to the new Lynas Seadrift facility in Texas serving the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD).
Lynas has been upgrading its Malaysian processing facilities to increase separation capacity to 10,500 tons per year for neodymium and praseodymium, used in magnets in sectors from electrified transport to defence.
The firm halted all Malaysian operations, barring one, in mid-November.
Its expansion project at the Mt Weld mine in Western Australia remains on track, Lynas said, after a completed drilling program showed extensive rare-earth mineralisation around the mine.
Lynas estimated March quarter production at around 1500 tons, above its previous estimate of around 900 tons.
Shares eased 3.4% to A$5.75 to hit their lowest since July 20, 2021, as of 0009 GMT.
Lynas raked in an average second-quarter selling price of A$28.70 per kilogram (kg) for its product range, sharply below the A$58.40 per kg last year.

Lynas Rare Earths Limited's (ASX:LYC) largest shareholders are individual investors with 57% ownership, institutions own 40% 2024-01-30T00:26:09.000Z

To get a sense of who is truly in control of Lynas Rare Earths Limited (
), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are individual investors with 57% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
Meanwhile, institutions make up 40% of the company’s shareholders. Large companies usually have institutions as shareholders, and we usually see insiders owning shares in smaller companies.
Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Lynas Rare Earths, beginning with the chart below.
Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.
As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Lynas Rare Earths. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Lynas Rare Earths' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.
We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Lynas Rare Earths. The company's largest shareholder is State Street Global Advisors, Inc., with ownership of 5.2%. With 5.1% and 5.0% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and The Vanguard Group, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.
Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Lynas Rare Earths Limited. However, it's possible that insiders might have an indirect interest through a more complex structure. Keep in mind that it's a big company, and the insiders own AU$22m worth of shares. The absolute value might be more important than the proportional share. Arguably, recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can 
The general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, collectively holds 57% of Lynas Rare Earths shares. With this amount of ownership, retail investors can collectively play a role in decisions that affect shareholder returns, such as dividend policies and the appointment of directors. They can also exercise the power to vote on acquisitions or mergers that may not improve profitability.
Our data indicates that Private Companies hold 3.3%, of the company's shares. It might be worth looking deeper into this. If related parties, such as insiders, have an interest in one of these private companies, that should be disclosed in the annual report. Private companies may also have a strategic interest in the company.
I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks for example - Lynas Rare Earths has

UPDATE 5-Australia's Lynas Rare Earths quits tie-up talks with MP Materials 2024-02-05T02:05:58.000Z

*
Deal had been pitched for Q1- source
*
Talks included plans to drop Aussie listing for New York-source
*
Lynas says it is focusing on organic growth
(Adds detail in headline, paragraph 1, updates share price in paragraph 14)
MELBOURNE, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Australia's Lynas Rare Earths said on Monday confidential talks have ended with U.S.-based MP Materials for a possible merger that industry sources said would have been difficult for the sides to agree on a value.
Lynas is the world's biggest producer of rare earths outside of China, and MP is the biggest in the United States. Talks come as Western nations seek to diversify supply chains for the magnetic metals that are used in everything from wind turbines to electric vehicles to missiles.
China is the world's top rare earths consumer and producer, controlling some 87% of global rare earths refining capacity, according to the International Energy Agency. The merger talks come as rare earths prices have sharply dropped due to a slowdown in China's economy.
"Lynas confirms it has held confidential discussions with MP Materials Corp regarding a potential transaction, however, these discussions are not ongoing," it said in a release to Australia's securities exchange.
Lynas has been constructing a processing plant in Western Australia's Kalgoorlie to add to its refining operations in Malaysia and the U.S. where it is building processing facilities in Texas supported by the Department of Defense.
MP processes rock that it extracts from its Mountain Pass mine in California into rare earths concentrate that is shipped to China for refining. It has been struggling to crack the difficult technology to refine its own material for some time.
China in December banned the export of technology to make rare earth magnets adding it to a ban already in place on technology to extract and separate the critical materials. "I wouldn't think there is a whole lot of synergies out of that, just consolidating supply," Argo Investments portfolio manager Andy Foster said of a potential tie-up between Lynas and MP.
"As a shareholder, what's the real benefit? (Lynas) has got one of the best rare earths deposits in the world. I get the consolidation argument but I'm not sure about any strategic value transfer."
SPECULATION
One source with direct knowledge of the proposal said that general contours of a deal would have involved Lynas de-listing in Australia and MP keeping its New York Stock Exchange listing, and that any deal was aimed for the first quarter.
But industry sources questioned what Lynas, which already has a strong customer base in Japan and highly specialised technology, would get from the deal, making it hard to agree on a value for the tie-up. Anti-trust regulation would also be a major hurdle, they said, even as Western countries try to reduce China's dominance.
In the statement, Lynas said it was building its growth organically and looking to build scale. Its second-quarter revenue fell sharply, missing analysts' estimates, hurt by low prices for its main product neodymium and praseodymium (NdPr).
The rare earth miner has a current market capitalisation of about $3.55 billion, while its New-York listed peer is valued at $3.06 billion. Shares in MP closed up 6.4% on Friday while Lynas shares traded 1.7% lower on Monday morning.

Lynas Rare Earths Limited Just Beat Earnings Expectations: Here's What Analysts Think Will Happen Next 2024-02-27T20:18:42.000Z

The half-yearly results for 
 (
) were released last week, making it a good time to revisit its performance. It looks like a credible result overall - although revenues of AU$235m were what the analysts expected, Lynas Rare Earths surprised by delivering a (statutory) profit of AU$0.042 per share, an impressive 2,010% above what was forecast. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. So we collected the latest post-earnings statutory consensus estimates to see what could be in store for next year.
Taking into account the latest results, the current consensus, from the twelve analysts covering Lynas Rare Earths, is for revenues of AU$580.1m in 2024. This implies a noticeable 4.0% reduction in Lynas Rare Earths' revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to rise 8.9% to AU$0.23. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of AU$605.7m and earnings per share (EPS) of AU$0.20 in 2024. Although the analysts have lowered their revenue forecasts, they've also made a substantial gain in their earnings per share estimates, which implies there's been something of an uptick in sentiment following the latest results.
The consensus has made no major changes to the price target of AU$7.67, suggesting the forecast improvement in earnings is expected to offset the decline in revenues next year. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. The most optimistic Lynas Rare Earths analyst has a price target of AU$10.00 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at AU$6.50. These price targets show that analysts do have some differing views on the business, but the estimates do not vary enough to suggest to us that some are betting on wild success or utter failure.
Of course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the 
 itself. We would highlight that revenue is expected to reverse, with a forecast 7.8% annualised decline to the end of 2024. That is a notable change from historical growth of 22% over the last five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the same industry are forecast to see their revenue grow 0.4% annually for the foreseeable future. It's pretty clear that Lynas Rare Earths' revenues are expected to perform substantially worse than the wider industry.
The biggest takeaway for us is the consensus earnings per share upgrade, which suggests a clear improvement in sentiment around Lynas Rare Earths' earnings potential next year. On the negative side, they also downgraded their revenue estimates, and forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry. Even so, earnings are more important to the intrinsic value of the business. The consensus price target held steady at AU$7.67, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.
With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Lynas Rare Earths. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits. We have estimates - from multiple Lynas Rare Earths analysts - going out to 2026, and you can 
It is also worth noting that we have found

Lynas Rare Earths' (ASX:LYC) investors will be pleased with their splendid 274% return over the last five years 2024-03-19T03:10:31.000Z

It hasn't been the best quarter for 
 (ASX:LYC) shareholders, since the share price has fallen 15% in that time. But in stark contrast, the returns over the last half decade have impressed. It's fair to say most would be happy with 269% the gain in that time. So while it's never fun to see a share price fall, it's important to look at a longer time horizon. Ultimately business performance will determine whether the stock price continues the positive long term trend.
Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns.
While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.
Over half a decade, Lynas Rare Earths managed to grow its earnings per share at 47% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 30% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.
You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).
It's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..
Investors should note that there's a difference between Lynas Rare Earths' total shareholder return (TSR) and its share price change, which we've covered above. The TSR attempts to capture the value of dividends (as if they were reinvested) as well as any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings offered to shareholders. Lynas Rare Earths hasn't been paying dividends, but its TSR of 274% exceeds its share price return of 269%, implying it has either spun-off a business, or raised capital at a discount; thereby providing additional value to shareholders.
While the broader market gained around 15% in the last year, Lynas Rare Earths shareholders lost 7.7%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 30% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered 
 (1 is a bit unpleasant!) that you should be aware of before investing here.

Are Lynas Rare Earths Limited's (ASX:LYC) Fundamentals Good Enough to Warrant Buying Given The Stock's Recent Weakness? 2024-04-05T20:33:40.000Z

With its stock down 16% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard Lynas Rare Earths (ASX:LYC). But if you pay close attention, you might find that its key financial indicators look quite decent, which could mean that the stock could potentially rise in the long-term given how markets usually reward more resilient long-term fundamentals. In this article, we decided to focus on 
 ROE.
Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Lynas Rare Earths is:
9.1% = AU$200m ÷ AU$2.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).
The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every A$1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated A$0.09 in profit.
We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or "retains" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.
At first glance, Lynas Rare Earths' ROE doesn't look very promising. However, its ROE is similar to the industry average of 10%, so we won't completely dismiss the company. Moreover, we are quite pleased to see that Lynas Rare Earths' net income grew significantly at a rate of 44% over the last five years. Considering the moderately low ROE, it is quite possible that there might be some other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.
We then compared Lynas Rare Earths' net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 21% in the same 5-year period.
The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. If you're wondering about Lynas Rare Earths''s valuation, check out 
, as compared to its industry.
Lynas Rare Earths doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.
In total, it does look like Lynas Rare Earths has some positive aspects to its business. Despite its low rate of return, the fact that the company reinvests a very high portion of its profits into its business, no doubt contributed to its high earnings growth. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

Australia's Rinehart takes stake in Lynas Rare Earths, shares jump 2024-04-17T03:11:24.000Z

By Melanie Burton
MELBOURNE (Reuters) -Australia's richest person, Gina Rinehart, become a substantial shareholder in Lynas Rare Earths, the largest producer of rare earths outside of China, an exchange filing showed late on Tuesday.
The stake, taken by Rinehart's privately held Hancock Prospecting, is fuelling speculation of sector consolidation, after the magnate acted as a kingmaker in Australian lithium, and following merger talks between Lynas and the next biggest Western rare earths miner, MP Materials, earlier this year.
Lynas shares rose as much as 5.9%.
Rinehart and Hancock Prospecting have become substantial shareholders of Lynas with 5.82% voting power, according to the filing. Hancock took a substantial stakeholding in the U.S. rare-earths producer MP Materials, MP said earlier this month.
Lynas and MP Materials ended talks over a potential merger in February.
Lynas appreciates the support of its shareholders but does not comment on individual shareholders, a Lynas spokesperson said. Hancock declined to comment.
"We wonder whether Rinehart's emergence as a major shareholder in both Lynas and MP will prove a catalyst that encourages a merger," broker Canaccord said in a note on Wednesday.
"We could imagine clear synergies from such a tie-up: strategic re-orientations and cost savings that would enhance profitability at a time of subdued prices. A merged entity would also help to solidify a scaled Western rare earths champion to counter China’s dominance."
Lynas mines rare earths at its Mount Weld mine in Western Australia which are shipped to Malaysia for processing. It is building out processing facilities in the United States for the highly magnetic metals that are critical to wind turbines, electric vehicles and missiles.
Lynas investor Andy Forster of Argo Investments said Hancock's move was interesting "given she's clearly made a play across the whole space. She obviously wants to potentially have a seat at the table if there's any chance of consolidation."
"In the scheme of things for her, it's probably a relatively small investment," he said. "(Rare earths have) obviously been pretty depressed of late. If you're making a strategic long-term investment it's probably not a bad time to get in."
Prices for Neodymium have slumped by nearly three quarters since early 2022 when prices spiked following COVID-era border closures that crimped supply to dominant producer China.
Rinehart is Australia's richest person with a fortune made from iron ore. Hancock has been aggressively acquiring stakes in lithium miners, thwarting a deal by top U.S. lithium chemicals maker Albemarle for Australia's Liontown last year.
More recently she has turned her attention to rare earths. Hancock's investments include a 6.17% stake in Brazilian Rare Earths and a 9.14% holdings in Arafura Rare Earths, according to LSEG data.

Lynas Rare Earths' revenue slumps, misses expectations 2024-04-24T00:47:34.000Z

MELBOURNE (Reuters) -Australian miner Lynas posted a slump in third-quarter sales revenue on Wednesday, missing analyst expectations on the back of a plunge in prices for rare earths, while it flagged higher costs at a project in Western Australia.
Prices of rare earths were fairly weak during the third quarter, as increased production in China, the top producer, and slower-than-expected demand growth recovery remained a drag.
"The market continues to be less than kind to us and to anybody else in rare earths sector," CEO Amanda Lacaze told analysts on a quarterly call, noting a "slight improvement in price, but not at a significantly accelerated rate."
"There's a general consensus that the current price is below cost for many Chinese producers. There's also a general consensus that the Chinese economy is starting to pick up momentum again," she said.
Given low prices, Lynas won't be accelerating production at its Malaysian operations and will hold on to inventories to wait for prices to improve, she said.
The firm's quarterly sales revenue fell to A$101.2 million ($65.64 million) in the three months to March 31, down from A$242.8 million a year earlier. It missed a Visible Alpha consensus estimate of A$146.3 million, according to Morgan Stanley. Lynas shares traded down 1.2%.
Lynas raised the budget for its Kalgoorlie facility in Western Australia to A$800 million from A$730 million it projected in October.
Cost management is a major focus, Lacaze said.
The company said its Mt Weld Expansion Project in Western Australia was on track with construction activities progressing as planned during the quarter.
It expects to start earth works at a U.S. processing plant it is building in Texas by the end of the year, as the world's biggest economy looks to reduce its reliance on China.
"I think nobody would be surprised that the U.S. government is very focused on making sure this project moves forward as fast as possible," Lacaze said.

RS or LYSDY: Which Is the Better Value Stock Right Now? 2024-05-22T15:40:11.000Z

Investors interested in stocks from the Mining - Miscellaneous sector have probably already heard of Reliance (RS) and Lynas Corp. (LYSDY). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.
Right now, Reliance is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Lynas Corp. has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that RS is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.
RS currently has a forward P/E ratio of 15.31, while LYSDY has a forward P/E of 64.09. We also note that RS has a PEG ratio of 6.68. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. LYSDY currently has a PEG ratio of 13.72.
Another notable valuation metric for RS is its P/B ratio of 2.17. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, LYSDY has a P/B of 3.01.
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to RS's Value grade of B and LYSDY's Value grade of F.
RS has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than LYSDY, so it seems like value investors will conclude that RS is the superior option right now.

Estimating The Intrinsic Value Of Lynas Rare Earths Limited (ASX:LYC) 2024-05-29T20:16:55.000Z

Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Lynas Rare Earths Limited (
) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!
We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the 
.
We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:
 = AU$2.0b
After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.3%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.5%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$526m× (1 + 2.3%) ÷ (7.5%– 2.3%) = AU$10b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$10b÷ ( 1 + 7.5%)
= AU$4.9b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is AU$6.9b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of AU$6.7, the company appears about fair value at a 9.3% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.
The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Lynas Rare Earths as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.148. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to "what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For Lynas Rare Earths, we've put together three pertinent elements you should assess:

Returns On Capital At Lynas Rare Earths (ASX:LYC) Have Stalled 2024-06-15T22:17:18.000Z

If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. However, after investigating 
 (
), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger.
Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Lynas Rare Earths is:
0.062 = AU$159m ÷ (AU$2.7b - AU$142m) 
.
So, 
 Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Metals and Mining industry average of 11%.
In the above chart we have measured Lynas Rare Earths' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our 
.
The returns on capital haven't changed much for Lynas Rare Earths in recent years. The company has consistently earned 6.2% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 235% in that time. Given the company has increased the amount of capital employed, it appears the investments that have been made simply don't provide a high return on capital.
Long story short, while Lynas Rare Earths has been reinvesting its capital, the returns that it's generating haven't increased. Investors must think there's better things to come because the stock has knocked it out of the park, delivering a 139% gain to shareholders who have held over the last five years. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.
If you want to know some of the risks facing Lynas Rare Earths we've found 
 (1 is a bit concerning!) that you should be aware of before investing here.

Exploring Bell Financial Group And Two More ASX Stocks Estimated To Be Trading Below Their Value 2024-06-25T19:08:23.000Z

Over the past year, the Australian stock market has shown robust growth, appreciating by 9.9%, while remaining stable in the last week. In this context of promising earnings forecasts with an expected annual growth of 14%, stocks like Bell Financial Group that are trading below their perceived value present intriguing opportunities for investors seeking potential gains.
Underneath we present a selection of stocks filtered out by our screen
 Bell Financial Group Limited (ASX:BFG) operates in the financial sector, offering services such as broking, online broking, corporate finance, and financial advisory to a diverse client base, with a market capitalization of approximately A$0.44 billion.
 Bell Financial Group generates revenue through four primary channels: retail broking (A$103.58 million), institutional broking (A$50.36 million), financial products and services (A$48.10 million), and technology solutions for trading platforms (A$26.20 million).
 23.6%
Bell Financial Group, priced at A$1.36, is trading significantly below its estimated fair value of A$1.78, marking a 23.6% undervaluation based on discounted cash flow analysis. Despite a low forecasted return on equity of 16.3% in three years, the company's earnings are expected to grow by 26.95% annually, outpacing the Australian market's average growth rate of 13.7%. However, its dividend sustainability is questionable as it is not well covered by earnings or cash flows.
 Lynas Rare Earths Limited operates in the exploration, development, mining, extraction, and processing of rare earth minerals primarily in Australia and Malaysia, with a market capitalization of approximately A$5.66 billion.
 The company generates its revenue primarily from rare earth operations, which amounted to A$604.08 million.
 19.8%
Lynas Rare Earths, currently valued at A$6.06, appears undervalued with a potential fair value of A$7.55, reflecting a 19.8% discrepancy based on discounted cash flow analysis. Despite lower profit margins this year compared to last, the company is poised for substantial growth with earnings expected to increase by 33.22% annually and revenue projected to rise by 28.2% per year—both rates surpassing broader Australian market trends significantly.
 Stockland is a prominent developer specializing in creating connected communities, with a market capitalization of approximately A$10.80 billion.
 The company generates revenue primarily through its Communities and Commercial Property segments, with figures amounting to A$1.77 billion and A$0.81 billion respectively.
 35.6%
Stockland, priced at A$4.53, trades below its estimated fair value of A$7.04, suggesting a significant undervaluation based on discounted cash flow analysis. Expected to outperform with a 22% annual earnings growth over the next three years—higher than the Australian market average of 13.7%. However, its profit margins have declined to 9.1% from last year's 31%, and dividends are poorly supported by cash flows, indicating potential financial stress despite forecasted revenue growth outpacing the market at 7% annually.

GLNCY vs. LYSDY: Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now? 2024-06-27T15:40:09.000Z

Investors interested in stocks from the Mining - Miscellaneous sector have probably already heard of Glencore PLC (GLNCY) and Lynas Corp. (LYSDY). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.
Right now, Glencore PLC is sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Lynas Corp. has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This means that GLNCY's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.
GLNCY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 13.13, while LYSDY has a forward P/E of 53.18. We also note that GLNCY has a PEG ratio of 3.09. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. LYSDY currently has a PEG ratio of 11.39.
Another notable valuation metric for GLNCY is its P/B ratio of 1.83. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, LYSDY has a P/B of 2.50.
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to GLNCY's Value grade of A and LYSDY's Value grade of F.
GLNCY stands above LYSDY thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that GLNCY is the superior value option right now.

What U.S. Companies Need to Know About China's Rare Earth Restriction 2024-07-09T21:00:00.000Z

Via 
The Rare Earths MMI (
) took a steep dive in price action after a month of relative stability, dropping 14.4%. Terbium (both metal and oxide) yanked the index down tremendously, falling more than 16%. However, the rare earths index could yet experience some rebound from now until October, when China’s recent set of brand new rare earth restrictions are set to take effect (stay posted on shifts in the rare earths market due to China’s new export restrictions with 
).
China recently unveiled a fresh set of restrictions designed to further tighten control over its exports of rare earth elements. The new rules adhere to earlier prohibitions regarding the export of germanium and gallium, which are necessary for the 
.
The implications for the U.S. could prove substantial, as the country is one of the primary users of rare earth elements for high-tech and defense sectors. These new regulations likely mean more supply chain interruptions and expenses. Since China’s domination of the rare earth market creates a bottleneck, many experts expect the new rules to raise 
As a result, American businesses will likely need to step up their efforts to boost home production and diversify their supply network of rare earths. The circumstance also emphasizes the urgency of developing other supply networks, recycling technology, and 
.
U.S. businesses should look for suppliers outside of China to deal with this issue. For example, building connections with producers of rare earth elements in nations such as Canada and Australia can help reduce the dangers brought on by China’s new policies. Generally, diversification helps to lessen reliance on a single supplier and guarantees 
Additionally, ramping up domestic manufacturing of rare earths continues to gain traction. Therefore, businesses should work with American mining companies to finance the construction of regional rare earth processing and mining facilities. This action can help strengthen the supply chain against interruptions from abroad while also aligning with 
.
One sustainable option is recycling rare earths from items that are nearing the end of their lifespan. Investing in cutting-edge recycling methods to recover rare earth elements from discarded electronics and 
 can go a long way toward reducing reliance on imported resources.j
Finding and creating substitutes for rare earth elements can also lead to long-term fixes. Businesses should engage in R&D to find and market alternative materials that can replace rare earths in a variety of applications, thus guaranteeing that technological developments continue uninterrupted.
As the world’s largest producer of rare earths outside of China, Lynas continues to boldly challenge China’s long-standing dominance in this crucial market, taking a strategic approach to leverage Australia’s rich deposits of rare earth elements. By ramping up production and investing heavily in new technologies, Lynas aims to secure a

Among Lynas’s more creative actions was constructing a cutting-edge processing facility in Malaysia. With the help of this facility, Lynas can process rare earths outside of China’s sphere of influence, giving its global clients a more reliable and secure supply chain. Furthermore, Lynas continues to increase its research and development efforts to provide more effective and eco-friendly extraction techniques, establishing a new

The effects of Lynas’ work could prove significant. Through supply chain diversification, Lynas is lowering the world’s dependency on Chinese rare earths. This change frees nations from geopolitical restrictions, allowing them to pursue their technical achievements while also improving supply chain security. With each step of its expansion, Lynas is challenging China’s hegemony and establishing Australia as a major participant in the global

With 52% ownership, Lynas Rare Earths Limited (ASX:LYC) boasts of strong institutional backing 2024-07-12T02:16:31.000Z

If you want to know who really controls Lynas Rare Earths Limited (
), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 52% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.
Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Lynas Rare Earths, beginning with the chart below.
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Lynas Rare Earths. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Lynas Rare Earths, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.
Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Lynas Rare Earths is not owned by hedge funds. State Street Global Advisors, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 6.4% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 6.3% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.1% by the third-largest shareholder.
Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 52% of the ownership is controlled by the top 11 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.
While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.
Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.
Our information suggests that Lynas Rare Earths Limited insiders own under 1% of the company. But they may have an indirect interest through a corporate structure that we haven't picked up on. It's a big company, so even a small proportional interest can create alignment between the board and shareholders. In this case insiders own AU$24m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking 
With a 38% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Lynas Rare Earths. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.
We can see that Private Companies own 9.2%, of the shares on issue. It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company.
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 
 (of which 1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) you should know about.

Exploring Undervalued ASX Stocks With Intrinsic Discounts Ranging From 28.8% To 47.3% 2024-07-17T19:05:44.000Z

The Australian market has shown resilience with a 2.1% increase over the last week and a notable 10% growth over the past 12 months, alongside an optimistic forecast of annual earnings growth at 13%. In such an encouraging environment, identifying stocks that appear undervalued relative to their intrinsic value can offer potential opportunities for investors.
Let's take a closer look at a couple of our picks from the screened companies.
 Life360, Inc. is a technology company that provides a platform for locating people, pets, and things across North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and globally, with a market capitalization of approximately A$3.78 billion.
 The company generates its revenue primarily through its software and programming segment, which brought in $314.60 million.
 31.3%
Life360, trading at A$17.01, is perceived as undervalued compared to its fair value of A$24.77, reflecting a significant discount. Despite recent substantial insider selling and a low forecasted Return on Equity of 14.6% in three years, the company is expected to become profitable within this period with earnings projected to grow by 63.48% annually. Recent activities include a follow-on equity offering raising A$155.25 million and amendments enhancing corporate governance structures, positioning Life360 for potential growth despite current undervaluation based on cash flows.
 Ansell Limited is a global company that designs, develops, and manufactures protection solutions across regions including the Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, and North America with a market capitalization of A$3.77 billion.
 The company generates revenue primarily through two segments: Healthcare, which brought in A$837.70 million, and Industrial (Including Specialty Markets), contributing A$767 million.
 47.3%
Ansell, priced at A$26.07, trades below its calculated fair value of A$49.51, indicating a potential undervaluation. Despite recent shareholder dilution and one-off items affecting earnings, Ansell's revenue is expected to grow by 8.1% annually, outpacing the Australian market's 5.3%. Earnings are also set to increase significantly at 23.23% per year over the next three years. However, its Return on Equity is projected to remain low at 8.8% in three years' time.
 Lynas Rare Earths Limited operates in the exploration, development, mining, extraction, and processing of rare earth minerals primarily in Australia and Malaysia, with a market capitalization of approximately A$5.88 billion.
 The company generates its revenue primarily from rare earth operations, which accounted for A$604.08 million.
 28.8%
Lynas Rare Earths, currently priced at A$6.29, is valued below its estimated fair value of A$8.83, reflecting a 28.8% potential undervaluation based on cash flows. The company's revenue and earnings growth projections outpace the Australian market significantly, with expected increases of 29.6% and 41.3% per year respectively. However, despite these strong growth forecasts, its profit margins have decreased from the previous year and its forecasted Return on Equity in three years is relatively low at 14.8%.

Investors interested in stocks from the Mining - Miscellaneous sector have probably already heard of Glencore PLC (GLNCY) and Lynas Corp. (LYSDY). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.
Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.
Currently, Glencore PLC has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Lynas Corp. has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This means that GLNCY's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.
GLNCY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.14, while LYSDY has a forward P/E of 23.64. We also note that GLNCY has a PEG ratio of 2.77. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. LYSDY currently has a PEG ratio of 5.06.
Another notable valuation metric for GLNCY is its P/B ratio of 1.70. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, LYSDY has a P/B of 2.57.
These metrics, and several others, help GLNCY earn a Value grade of A, while LYSDY has been given a Value grade of D.
GLNCY has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than LYSDY, so it seems like value investors will conclude that GLNCY is the superior option right now.
