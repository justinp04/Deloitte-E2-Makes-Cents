ResMed (RMD) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth 2024-07-25T14:01:50.000Z

ResMed (RMD) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 1. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.
While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.
This maker of medical products for respiratory disorders is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.02 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +26.3%.
Revenues are expected to be $1.21 billion, up 7.5% from the year-ago quarter.
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.16% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.
Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.
Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).
For ResMed, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.35%.
On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.
So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that ResMed will beat the consensus EPS estimate.
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.
For the last reported quarter, it was expected that ResMed would post earnings of $1.92 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.13, delivering a surprise of +10.94%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.
That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.
ResMed doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

Analysts Estimate Perrigo (PRGO) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for 2024-07-26T14:00:30.000Z

The market expects Perrigo (PRGO) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.
The earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 2, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.
This drug company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.48 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -23.8%.
Revenues are expected to be $1.13 billion, down 5.2% from the year-ago quarter.
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.47% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.

Could The Market Be Wrong About ResMed Inc. (NYSE:RMD) Given Its Attractive Financial Prospects? 2024-07-29T16:02:58.000Z

ResMed (NYSE:RMD) has had a rough three months with its share price down 7.9%. However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Specifically, we decided to study 
 ROE in this article.
Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.
The 
 is:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for ResMed is:
21% = US$958m ÷ US$4.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).
The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.21 in profit.
We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or "retains" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.
To start with, ResMed's ROE looks acceptable. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 10%. This certainly adds some context to ResMed's decent 16% net income growth seen over the past five years.
As a next step, we compared ResMed's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 8.3%.
The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is RMD fairly valued? This
 has everything you need to know.
ResMed has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 31% (or a retention ratio of 69%) and a respectable amount of growth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making efficient use of its profits.
Additionally, ResMed has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 29%. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 22%.
In total, we are pretty happy with ResMed's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates. To know more about the company's future earnings growth forecasts take a look at this

Wall Street is still jittery on GLP-1s 2024-07-30T08:04:40.000Z

Wall Street's concerns about GLP-1s' impact on medical device makers was back in full swing after glucose monitoring device seller Dexcom (
) slashed its full-year guidance after an earnings miss last week.
However, Dexcom's troubles appear unrelated to the weight loss and diabetes drug frenzy, as competitors such as Abbott (
) and Medtronic (
) haven't been pressured by the miss, once again allaying Wall Street's fears.
The company attributed its guidance to a fumbled sales strategy.
"It was a much more disruptive expansion that we've had in the past, and that did lead to a lot of disruption, particularly at the beginning of the quarter. We saw things getting better toward the end," said CEO Kevin Sayer on an earnings call.
The Street previously pressured food and beverage stocks on fears of long-term declines expected from GLP-1 use. That has proven to not be the case, even as the GLP-1 market is expected to reach $130 billion by 2030.
Still, medical device stocks have been through a roller-coaster ride in the past year, in part on Wall Street's reaction to data and updates about GLP-1s.
Take, for example, 
 from Eli Lilly (
), maker of the weight-loss drug Zepbound, that its GLP-1 formula helps reduce incidents of sleep apnea. The data showed greater reduction for those who use pressurized breathing masks, known as CPAP machines, but the news still sent stocks of CPAP makers down.
That includes ResMed (
), a leader in the space. CEO Mick Farrell told Yahoo Finance he sees the news as a tailwind rather than a sign of trouble.
"They're going to bring more patients into my funnel, and we're going to continue to grow," Farrell said.
He sees the opportunity growing further as tech companies like Apple (
), Google (
, 
), Samsung, and the Oura ring offer sleep monitoring software on their devices. This, he said, will bring more awareness about sleep apnea, and therefore more patients.
In the past year, there have been multiple instances of Wall Street predictions dooming sectors based on GLP-1 data, but experts insist the reality is that the potential frenzy has been tamped primarily by supply constraints.
JPM analysts said in a note in August 2023, in response to one company's earnings showing lower volumes of bariatric surgery in a quarter, "Unless patients commit to using GLP-1s for life, which many aren’t keen to do, they’ll likely still progress to bariatric surgery, which remains extremely underpenetrated."
The idea of being an underpenetrated market holds true for continuous glucose monitoring devices and CPAP machines, along with bariatric surgery. And it's also true for GLP-1s, which have only been available in a limited number of countries and markets to date, as both the market leaders work to add manufacturing capacity.
Wall Street jitters haven't spared the GLP-1 makers, either. The current duopoly of Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk (
) is being threatened by several hundred clinical trials for rival GLP-1s. Among those being closely watched are Roche (
), Amgen (
), Pfizer (
), and the biotech Viking Therapeutics (
).
Roche recently announced positive early-stage trial data, while Viking is beginning its final-stage clinical trial — the news within the span of a week sent Eli Lilly's stock diving. It traded down 14% in eight days and lost $120 billion in market value. But the same news didn't drag Novo's stock as much.

S&P 500 Gains and Losses Today: Onsemi Stock Jumps as Car Industry Drives Sales Beat 2024-07-29T21:11:45.000Z

Major U.S. equities indexes were mixed and little changed on the 
. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq eked out gains of less than 0.1%, while the Dow closed Monday's session 0.1% lower.
While traders widely expect the Federal Reserve to hold interest rates steady at its 
, observers will be digging into the central bank's statement for indications that a rate cut is on tap for September.
Meanwhile, earnings reports from big tech firms will likely take center stage throughout the week, with Apple (
), Facebook parent Meta (
), Amazon (
), and Microsoft (
) all scheduled to release quarterly results.
ON Semiconductor (
) shares notched the top performance of any stock in the S&P 500 on Monday, skyrocketing 11.5% after the chipmaker reported 
 for the second quarter. Onsemi pointed to strength in the automotive industry, highlighting a recently signed multi-year agreement to supply Volkswagen (
) with semiconductors for its electric vehicles (EVs). The company also touted strategic investments to expand its product portfolio.
Shares of medical device manufacturer Revvity (
) added 9.1% after the company 
 with its second-quarter results. Although revenue in the firm's life sciences division slipped from the prior year, sales in the diagnostics segment ticked higher, and solid demand for diagnostics products encouraged Revvity to boost its full-year earnings per share (EPS) guidance. 
Shares of fellow medical technology provider ResMed (
) gained 5.8% after Zacks Equities Research highlighted the stock as a potential pick for growth investors, citing projected profit growth and a strong cash position. ResMed shares came under pressure last month after a weight loss treatment from Eli Lilly (
) showed 
 among obese patients, potentially limiting the sales of ResMed's sleep apnea masks. However, ResMed's CEO has indicated the news could increase awareness about sleep apnea and drive growth for the company's devices.
Solar stocks moved lower on Monday following news that federal officials have expressed concerns about 
 the renewable energy sector. A memo from the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) reportedly described how malicious actors could attack solar infrastructure and outlined measures that companies in the industry could take to protect themselves. Shares of solar technology firm Enphase Energy (
) sank 4.7%, marking the steepest daily losses in the S&P 500, while shares of solar panel manufacturer First Solar (
) slipped 2.8%.
Shares of cloud-based enterprise software provider ServiceNow (
) fell 3.5% on the day. Monday's losses mark a retreat from the stock's 
 after ServiceNow reported better-than-expected sales and profits, with solid growth in subscription revenue driven by demand for artificial intelligence (AI) products.
Southwest Airlines (
) shares dropped 3.4% on Monday. The carrier made headlines last week when it announced that it would 
 of open seating and begin operating overnight flights. Southwest remains under pressure from activist investor Elliott Investment Management, which announced in June that it had 
 in the company and continues to call for leadership changes even after last week's strategy shift.

Looking for Stocks with Positive Earnings Momentum? Check Out These 2 Medical Names 2024-07-30T13:00:10.000Z

Quarterly financial reports play a vital role on Wall Street, as they help investors see how a company has performed and what might be coming down the road in the near-term. And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.
We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.
The Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.
Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. 
 earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.09 a share, just two days from its upcoming earnings release on August 1, 2024.
ResMed's Earnings ESP sits at 2.85%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.09 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.03.
RMD is just one of a large group of Medical stocks with a positive ESP figure. 
 is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.
Twist Bioscience is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on August 2, 2024. TWST's Most Accurate Estimate sits at -$0.78 a share three days from its next earnings release.
Twist Bioscience's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 1.68% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of -$0.79.
Because both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, RMD and TWST could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.

Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.
ResMed currently has an Earnings ESP of +2.85%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on August 1, 2024.
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.
Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

These 2 Medical Stocks Could Beat Earnings: Why They Should Be on Your Radar 2024-07-31T13:00:11.000Z

Earnings are arguably the most important single number on a company's quarterly financial report. Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.
We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.
The Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.
The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. 
 holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $4.95 a share six days away from its upcoming earnings release on August 6, 2024.
Amgen's Earnings ESP sits at 0.48%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $4.95 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.92.
AMGN is part of a big group of Medical stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at 
 as well.
ResMed, which is readying to report earnings on August 1, 2024, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $2.09 a share, and RMD is one day out from its next earnings report.
For ResMed, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.03 is 2.85%.
AMGN and RMD's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.
Use the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading. Check it out here >>

Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.
ResMed , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Products industry, posted revenues of $1.22 billion for the quarter ended June 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.73%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.12 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.
The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.
ResMed shares have added about 24% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 15.8%.
While ResMed has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?
There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.
Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for ResMed: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $2.06 on $1.19 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $8.71 on $5.01 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Medical - Products is currently in the top 36% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.
One other stock from the same industry, BioLife Solutions, Inc. (BLFS), is yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2024. The results are expected to be released on August 8.
This company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.14 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +39.1%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 22.2% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.
BioLife Solutions, Inc.'s revenues are expected to be $23.8 million, down 39.8% from the year-ago quarter.

Analysts Are Updating Their ResMed Inc. (NYSE:RMD) Estimates After Its Yearly Results 2024-08-04T13:17:42.000Z

Shareholders of 
 (
) will be pleased this week, given that the stock price is up 13% to US$224 following its latest yearly results. Results were roughly in line with estimates, with revenues of US$4.7b and statutory earnings per share of US$6.92. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.
After the latest results, the 19 analysts covering ResMed are now predicting revenues of US$5.03b in 2025. If met, this would reflect a modest 7.4% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to soar 26% to US$8.73. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$5.04b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$8.19 in 2025. So the consensus seems to have become somewhat more optimistic on ResMed's earnings potential following these results.
The consensus price target was unchanged at US$230, implying that the improved earnings outlook is not expected to have a long term impact on value creation for shareholders. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. There are some variant perceptions on ResMed, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$264 and the most bearish at US$200 per share. The narrow spread of estimates could suggest that the business' future is relatively easy to value, or thatthe analysts have a strong view on its prospects.
Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the 
. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that ResMed's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2025 expected to display 7.4% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 12% over the past five years. Juxtapose this against the other companies in the industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenues (in aggregate) 8.2% annually. So it's pretty clear that, while ResMed's revenue growth is expected to slow, it's expected to grow roughly in line with the industry.
The most important thing here is that the analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards ResMed following these results. Happily, there were no real changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow in line with the overall industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$230, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.
With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on ResMed. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits. At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for ResMed going out to 2027, and you can

Health Care Roundup: Market Talk 2024-08-06T10:53:00.000Z

0657 GMT – Bayer 2Q results could cause a muted share-price response as the company reiterated its group guidance and figures were broadly in line with consensus, Jefferies analysts say in a note. The German pharmaceutical and agricultural company’s adjusted Ebitda was slightly above market expectations and Jefferies estimates, the analysts say. Its full-year, currency-adjusted Ebitda is expected to be between EUR10.2 billion and EUR10.9 billion, above Jefferies’s estimate of EUR 10.1 billion, and with consensus in the middle of the new range at EUR10.4 billion, they say.
