Sonic Healthcare (ASX:SHL) Has Announced That It Will Be Increasing Its Dividend To A$0.62 2023-08-24T20:11:43.000Z

 (
) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 21st of September to A$0.62. This will take the annual payment to 3.2% of the stock price, which is above what most companies in the industry pay.
A big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. The last payment made up 71% of earnings, but cash flows were much higher. Since the dividend is just paying out cash to shareholders, we care more about the cash payout ratio from which we can see plenty is being left over for reinvestment in the business.
Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 21.8%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 62% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.
The company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from A$0.59 total annually to A$1.04. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 5.8% per annum over that time. The dividend has been growing very nicely for a number of years, and has given its shareholders some nice income in their portfolios.
The company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Sonic Healthcare has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 5.2% per annum. Recently, the company has been able to grow earnings at a decent rate, but with the payout ratio on the higher end we don't think the dividend has many prospects for growth.
Overall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.
Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. For instance, we've picked out
