Can Seven Group Holdings Limited's (ASX:SVW) ROE Continue To Surpass The Industry Average? 2023-08-17T21:00:09.000Z

While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Seven Group Holdings Limited (
).
ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.
The 
 is:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Seven Group Holdings is:
14% = AU$656m ÷ AU$4.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).
The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each A$1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made A$0.14 in profit.
By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Seven Group Holdings has a superior ROE than the average (7.5%) in the 
.
That's what we like to see. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk.
Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.
Seven Group Holdings does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.06. While its ROE is pretty respectable, the amount of debt the company is carrying currently is not ideal. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.
Return on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.
Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to check this FREE

Seven Group Holdings (ASX:SVW) Has Announced A Dividend Of A$0.23 2023-08-19T22:05:48.000Z

 (
) investors are due to receive a payment of A$0.23 per share on 13th of October. This means the dividend yield will be fairly typical at 1.7%.
Solid dividend yields are great, but they only really help us if the payment is sustainable. However, prior to this announcement, Seven Group Holdings' dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.
The next year is set to see EPS grow by 44.8%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 19% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.
The company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The annual payment during the last 10 years was A$0.40 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was A$0.46. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 1.4% a year over that time. Dividends have grown relatively slowly, which is not great, but some investors may value the relative consistency of the dividend.
The company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Seven Group Holdings has impressed us by growing EPS at 6.2% per year over the past five years. A low payout ratio and decent growth suggests that the company is reinvesting well, and it also has plenty of room to increase the dividend over time.
In summary, it is good to see that the dividend is staying consistent, and we don't think there is any reason to suspect this might change over the medium term. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.
Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 
 that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Is Seven Group Holdings not quite the opportunity you were looking for? Why not check out our

Seven Group Holdings (ASX:SVW) Is Due To Pay A Dividend Of A$0.23 2023-09-02T22:14:11.000Z

The board of 
 (
) has announced that it will pay a dividend of A$0.23 per share on the 13th of October. This means the dividend yield will be fairly typical at 1.6%.
We like a dividend to be consistent over the long term, so checking whether it is sustainable is important. However, Seven Group Holdings' earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.
Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 44.8%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 19%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.
Even over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The annual payment during the last 10 years was A$0.40 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was A$0.46. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 1.4% over that duration. Dividends have grown relatively slowly, which is not great, but some investors may value the relative consistency of the dividend.
Investors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Seven Group Holdings has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 6.2% per annum. A low payout ratio and decent growth suggests that the company is reinvesting well, and it also has plenty of room to increase the dividend over time.
Overall, we like to see the dividend staying consistent, and we think Seven Group Holdings might even raise payments in the future. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.
Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 
 that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. If you are a dividend investor, you might also want to look at our

Returns On Capital At Seven Group Holdings (ASX:SVW) Have Hit The Brakes 2023-09-16T22:44:56.000Z

What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing 
 on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing 
 of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. That's why when we briefly looked at 
 (
) ROCE trend, we were pretty happy with what we saw.
For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Seven Group Holdings is:
0.10 = AU$1.1b ÷ (AU$14b - AU$2.5b) 
.
So, 
 That's a relatively normal return on capital, and it's around the 11% generated by the Trade Distributors industry.
In the above chart we have measured Seven Group Holdings' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Seven Group Holdings 
 for 
While the returns on capital are good, they haven't moved much. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 10% and the business has deployed 109% more capital into its operations. 10% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that Seven Group Holdings has consistently earned this amount. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders.
The main thing to remember is that Seven Group Holdings has proven its ability to continually reinvest at respectable rates of return. And the stock has followed suit returning a meaningful 47% to shareholders over the last five years. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.

The total return for Seven Group Holdings (ASX:SVW) investors has risen faster than earnings growth over the last year 2023-10-05T23:01:13.000Z

The simplest way to invest in stocks is to buy exchange traded funds. But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. For example, the 
 (
) share price is up 56% in the last 1 year, clearly besting the market return of around 0.1% (not including dividends). If it can keep that out-performance up over the long term, investors will do very well! It is also impressive that the stock is up 38% over three years, adding to the sense that it is a real winner.
Since the long term performance has been good but there's been a recent pullback of 6.4%, let's check if the fundamentals match the share price.
To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.
Seven Group Holdings went from making a loss to reporting a profit, in the last year.
When a company has just transitioned to profitability, earnings per share growth is not always the best way to look at the share price action.
We doubt the modest 1.6% dividend yield is doing much to support the share price. However the year on year revenue growth of 8.8% would help. We do see some companies suppress earnings in order to accelerate revenue growth.
You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).
We consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. This 
 
 should help you form a view on Seven Group Holdings
It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Seven Group Holdings' TSR for the last 1 year was 59%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!
It's good to see that Seven Group Holdings has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 59% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 10% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered

Seven Group Holdings Limited's (ASX:SVW) top owners are private companies with 57% stake, while 29% is held by individual investors 2023-10-19T23:02:58.000Z

If you want to know who really controls Seven Group Holdings Limited (
), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are private companies with 57% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
Meanwhile, individual investors make up 29% of the company’s shareholders.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Seven Group Holdings.
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Seven Group Holdings. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Seven Group Holdings' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.
We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Seven Group Holdings. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is North Aston Pty Limited with 38% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 19% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.3% by the third-largest shareholder.
A more detailed study of the shareholder registry showed us that 2 of the top shareholders have a considerable amount of ownership in the company, via their 57% stake.
Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Seven Group Holdings Limited in their own names. But they may have an indirect interest through a corporate structure that we haven't picked up on. Keep in mind that it's a big company, and the insiders own AU$38m worth of shares. The absolute value might be more important than the proportional share. Arguably, recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can 
With a 29% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Seven Group Holdings. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.
It seems that Private Companies own 57%, of the Seven Group Holdings stock. It might be worth looking deeper into this. If related parties, such as insiders, have an interest in one of these private companies, that should be disclosed in the annual report. Private companies may also have a strategic interest in the company.
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Be aware that

Are Investors Undervaluing Seven Group Holdings Limited (ASX:SVW) By 33%? 2023-11-02T23:57:09.000Z

In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Seven Group Holdings Limited (
) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.
We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the 
 may be something of interest to you.
We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:
 = AU$6.6b
The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.4%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$1.3b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.4%– 2.0%) = AU$20b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$20b÷ ( 1 + 8.4%)
= AU$9.1b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is AU$16b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of AU$28.6, the company appears quite good value at a 33% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.
The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Seven Group Holdings as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.278. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Seven Group Holdings, we've put together three important factors you should further research:

Should You Investigate Seven Group Holdings Limited (ASX:SVW) At AU$30.33? 2023-11-17T01:57:05.000Z

Seven Group Holdings Limited (
), might not be a large cap stock, but it saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the ASX over the last few months. With many analysts covering the mid-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s examine Seven Group Holdings’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity.
Great news for investors – Seven Group Holdings is still trading at a fairly cheap price. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is A$42.71, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. What’s more interesting is that, Seven Group Holdings’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.
Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 51% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Seven Group Holdings. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.
 Since SVW is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.
 If you’ve been keeping an eye on SVW for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy SVW. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed buy.
In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved. For example - Seven Group Holdings has

Should We Be Delighted With Seven Group Holdings Limited's (ASX:SVW) ROE Of 14%? 2024-01-24T21:34:08.000Z

While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Seven Group Holdings Limited (
).
Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.
The 
 is:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Seven Group Holdings is:
14% = AU$656m ÷ AU$4.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).
The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each A$1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made A$0.14 in profit.
One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Seven Group Holdings has a higher ROE than the average (11%) in the 
.
That's clearly a positive. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk.
Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.
Seven Group Holdings does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.07. While its ROE is respectable, it is worth keeping in mind that there is usually a limit as to how much debt a company can use. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.
Return on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.
But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So I think it may be worth checking this

Australia's Seven Group offers $1.2 billion for full control of Boral 2024-02-19T02:22:35.000Z

By Scott Murdoch and Sameer Manekar
(Reuters) -Australian diversified investor Seven Group Holdings has offered A$1.9 billion ($1.24 billion) to take full control of building products group maker Boral in a bet Australia's infrastructure spending boom will be maintained in coming years.
Seven Group, headed by billionaire Kerry Stokes and his family, already owns nearly 72% of Boral, and the bid launched on Monday is designed to mop up the rest of the company.
The bid of a minimum of A$6.05 per Boral share consists of 0.1116 Seven Group shares and A$1.50 cash.
The deal would value Boral at A$6.67 billion ($4.35 billion and represent a 3.4% premium to Boral's last closing level of A$5.850.
In a statement, Seven Group said its offer was above any closing price Boral has traded at since 2007.
Boral has been reshaping it businesses in the past two years to increase its Australian building and industrial products group to take advantage of governments increasing their infrastructure spending programs. It sold down a number of overseas assets as it wound back its international divisions.
Boral shares rose 3.7% while Seven Group was down 1% in trading by early afternoon.
Boral in a separate statement recommended its shareholders take no action on the takeover offer, adding that an independent board committee had been established to review the offer.
Seven Group in 2021 made multiple takeover offers to acquire Boral, which it kept rejecting citing undervaluation of its business.
Seven Group ended up amassing around a 71% stake in just a few months in 2021 as record-low interest rates boosted Boral's domestic business, generating buyer interest.
Seven Group on Monday added it will raise its offer for Boral by another 10 Australian cents in the event it achieves an aggregate 80% stake in Boral or if Boral's board unanimously recommends the offer to its shareholders, or both.
The offer would increase by another 10 cents if Seven Group's stake reaches 90.6%, the compulsory acquisition threshold.
However, Seven Group said it would not buy Boral shares for an amount above A$6.25 apiece for at least a year after the offer closes.

Investors in Seven Group Holdings (ASX:SVW) have seen strong returns of 150% over the past five years 2024-03-13T23:24:03.000Z

The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can 
 more than 100%. One great example is 
 (
) which saw its share price drive 120% higher over five years. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 15% gain in the last three months. But this could be related to the strong market, which is up 7.1% in the last three months.
So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.
To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.
During the last half decade, Seven Group Holdings became profitable. That kind of transition can be an inflection point that justifies a strong share price gain, just as we have seen here.
The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).
We know that Seven Group Holdings has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This 
 
 should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.
As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Seven Group Holdings' TSR for the last 5 years was 150%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the 
 shareholder return.
We're pleased to report that Seven Group Holdings shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 77% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 20% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Seven Group Holdings better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - Seven Group Holdings has

Australia's Boral urges shareholders to reject Seven Group's $1.3 billion offer 2024-03-19T04:39:16.000Z

By Scott Murdoch and Roushni Nair
(Reuters) -Australia's Boral on Tuesday recommended investors reject its largest shareholder Seven Group Holdings' A$1.9 billion ($1.25 billion) offer for the company claiming it undervalues the building products group.
Seven Group, controlled by billionaire Kerry Stokes and his family, already owns nearly 72% of Boral and had launched a bid last month to acquire full control of Boral.
The proposal of a minimum of A$6.05 per Boral share consists of 0.1116 Seven Group shares and A$1.50 cash. The offer could go as high as $A6.39 per share if certain acceptance rates are met.
Grant Samuel, the independent expert firm, assessed fair value for Boral in the range of A$6.50-A$7.13 per share, the company said.
"While we respect the work that the bid response committee has put into arriving at this recommendation, we obviously disagree with their assessment strongly," Seven Group Chief Executive Ryan Stokes said in a statement on Tuesday.
The Seven offer values Boral at A$6.67 billion ($4.35 billion) and represents a 3.4% premium to its last closing level of A$5.850 on Feb. 16 before the bid arrived.
Seven earlier said it would raise the offer by another 10 Australian cents if it gained an aggregate 80% stake in Boral or if Boral's board unanimously recommended the offer to its shareholders, or both.
The offer would increase by another 10 cents if Seven Group's stake reaches 90.6%, the compulsory acquisition threshold.
The bid was declared best and final which means Seven cannot increase it again.
Grant Samuel concluded Seven Group's offer was "not fair and not reasonable", after which all Boral directors other than Seven Group nominees intend to reject the offer, the company said in a statement.
Boral said only 11.66 million shares had accepted the Seven offer since it opened on March 4, representing 1.06% of its total issued shares.

Seven Group Holdings Limited's (ASX:SVW) largest shareholders are private companies with 57% ownership, individual investors own 29% 2024-03-30T23:04:05.000Z

Every investor in Seven Group Holdings Limited (
) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are private companies with 57% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
Individual investors, on the other hand, account for 29% of the company's stockholders.
Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Seven Group Holdings.
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Seven Group Holdings. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Seven Group Holdings' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
Seven Group Holdings is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that North Aston Pty Limited is the largest shareholder with 38% of shares outstanding. Ashblue Holdings Pty Limited is the second largest shareholder owning 19% of common stock, and Australian Super Pty Ltd holds about 5.3% of the company stock.
To make our study more interesting, we found that the top 2 shareholders have a majority ownership in the company, meaning that they are powerful enough to influence the decisions of the company.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.
Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.
Our information suggests that Seven Group Holdings Limited insiders own under 1% of the company. We do note, however, it is possible insiders have an indirect interest through a private company or other corporate structure. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own AU$57m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to 
The general public-- including retail investors -- own 29% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.
It seems that Private Companies own 57%, of the Seven Group Holdings stock. It might be worth looking deeper into this. If related parties, such as insiders, have an interest in one of these private companies, that should be disclosed in the annual report. Private companies may also have a strategic interest in the company.
I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the

Is Seven Group Holdings Limited (ASX:SVW) Trading At A 31% Discount? 2024-04-16T05:10:39.000Z

Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Seven Group Holdings Limited (
) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!
We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the 
.
We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:
 = AU$8.2b
After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.9%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$1.6b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.9%– 2.2%) = AU$28b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$28b÷ ( 1 + 7.9%)
= AU$13b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is AU$21b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of AU$39.4, the company appears quite good value at a 31% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.
Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Seven Group Holdings as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.252. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For Seven Group Holdings, we've put together three relevant items you should consider:

At AU$37.62, Is Seven Group Holdings Limited (ASX:SVW) Worth Looking At Closely? 2024-05-02T21:04:07.000Z

While Seven Group Holdings Limited (
) might not have the largest market cap around , it received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the ASX over the last few months, increasing to AU$41.70 at one point, and dropping to the lows of AU$34.97. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Seven Group Holdings' current trading price of AU$37.62 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Seven Group Holdings’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.
Great news for investors – Seven Group Holdings is still trading at a fairly cheap price. Our valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is A$56.31, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. What’s more interesting is that, Seven Group Holdings’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.
Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Seven Group Holdings' earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.
 Since SVW is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.
 If you’ve been keeping an eye on SVW for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy SVW. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed buy.

Slowing Rates Of Return At Seven Group Holdings (ASX:SVW) Leave Little Room For Excitement 2024-06-05T01:30:44.000Z

There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. One common approach is to try and find a company with 
 on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing 
 of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Having said that, from a first glance at 
 (
) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.
For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Seven Group Holdings is:
0.097 = AU$1.1b ÷ (AU$14b - AU$2.4b) 
.
Therefore, 
 In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Trade Distributors industry average of 13%.
Above you can see how the current ROCE for Seven Group Holdings compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can 
 for 
There are better returns on capital out there than what we're seeing at Seven Group Holdings. The company has consistently earned 9.7% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 105% in that time. This poor ROCE doesn't inspire confidence right now, and with the increase in capital employed, it's evident that the business isn't deploying the funds into high return investments.
In conclusion, Seven Group Holdings has been investing more capital into the business, but returns on that capital haven't increased. Yet to long term shareholders the stock has gifted them an incredible 144% return in the last five years, so the market appears to be rosy about its future. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.
If you'd like to know about the risks facing Seven Group Holdings, we've discovered 
 that you should be aware of.

How Good Is Seven Group Holdings Limited (ASX:SVW), When It Comes To ROE? 2024-07-02T23:57:23.000Z

One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Seven Group Holdings Limited (
).
ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.
The 
 is:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Seven Group Holdings is:
11% = AU$551m ÷ AU$4.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).
The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every A$1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn A$0.11 in profit.
One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. The image below shows that Seven Group Holdings has an ROE that is roughly in line with the 
 average (11%).
That's neither particularly good, nor bad. Even if the ROE is respectable when compared to the industry, its worth checking if the firm's ROE is being aided by high debt levels. If true, then it is more an indication of risk than the potential. To know the 2 risks we have identified for Seven Group Holdings visit our 
Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.
It's worth noting the high use of debt by Seven Group Holdings, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.01. The combination of a rather low ROE and significant use of debt is not particularly appealing. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.
Return on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.
But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So I think it may be worth checking this 
 
.
