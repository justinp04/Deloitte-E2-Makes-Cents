Woodside to Acquire Tellurian in $900 Million Bet on Gas 2024-07-22T14:02:27.000Z

(Bloomberg) -- Woodside Energy Group Ltd. has agreed to buy troubled US liquefied natural gas export project developer Tellurian Inc. for about $900 million in a bet on rapid growth in global demand for the fuel.
Most Read from Bloomberg
Australia’s biggest oil and gas producer will pay about $1 a share in cash to take full control of Tellurian, including the proposed US Gulf Coast Driftwood LNG project, it said Monday. Woodside’s shares fell 2.1% in Sydney, their biggest one-day drop since May 1, after the news was announced. Tellurian shares rose over 65% Monday morning in New York.
Woodside has been one of the most vocal energy companies in arguing that more gas will be needed to complement the expansion of intermittent renewable energy sources. It has been on the hunt for potential US LNG investments to help expand its supply portfolio and Driftwood is just one of the handful that haven’t been affected by President Joe Biden’s pause on approvals in January.
“The acquisition of Tellurian and its Driftwood LNG development opportunity positions Woodside to be a global LNG powerhouse,” Woodside Chief Executive Officer Meg O’Neill said. “A complementary US position would allow us to better serve customers globally and capture further marketing optimization opportunities across both the Atlantic and Pacific Basins.”
Woodside is targeting a final investment decision for the first phase of the Driftwood project from the first quarter of 2025. If all four phases are completed, the Louisiana facility would be able to export 27.6 million tons a year — almost triple Woodside’s current capacity and nearly 6% of the global total at the end of last year.
Tellurian has been struggling to bring the facility to fruition since its 2016 founding by LNG industry pioneer Charif Souki, who left in December amid his own personal bankruptcy proceedings. Martin Houston — another industry veteran who co-founded Tellurian and is its current chairman — has vowed to slash costs, and there had been earlier discussions to sell the business.
“Woodside stepping into Driftwood provides a high degree of certainty around the project,” Houston said in an interview.
Driftwood has differed from other US LNG projects by inking long-term contracts linked to Asian and European spot prices. That exposed importers to the volatile spot market and ultimately cost Tellurian a number of potential deals, including with a major Indian customer, Shell Plc and Vitol SA.
Woodside “can better take forward the project than Tellurian can,” said Saul Kavonic, an energy analyst at Sydney-based MST Marquee. The Australian company “can remedy marketing relationships, funding, and operator capability deficits. This is the kind of deal Woodside should be doing — where Woodside can enter cheaply and add value.”
US private equity gas driller Aethon Energy has a non-binding agreement to buy LNG from the Driftwood project, after earlier this year acquiring Tellurian’s upstream gas assets. President Gordon Huddleston said in an interview that the firm looks forward to working with Woodside.
Woodside has been exploring opportunities to boost exports. Earlier this year, it ended talks with smaller rival Santos Ltd. that would have made it one the biggest LNG producers in the Asia-Pacific region. The company expects to bring potential partners into the Driftwood project, and aims to sell about 50%, it said in a presentation.
O’Neill said on an analyst call that the company has already received interest to work together on US LNG. The transaction is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter.

Woodside Ready to Advance Driftwood LNG Selldown Talks 2024-07-23T01:36:00.000Z

Woodside Energy is seeking to advance talks on the possible sale of a stake in the Driftwood LNG development in the southern U.S. in parallel with efforts to complete a $900 million acquisition of the project’s owner Tellurian.

Woodside Looks to Build ‘Dream Team of LNG’ at Acquired US Plant 2024-07-23T01:50:02.000Z

(Bloomberg) -- Woodside Energy Group Ltd. is searching for partners for its just-purchased US liquefied natural gas project in a bid to finally launch the troubled development.
Most Read from Bloomberg
“We’ve got an opportunity with the acquisition to put together the dream team of LNG,” said Meg O’Neill, chief executive officer at the Australian oil and gas producer. The company plans to “talk to a number of different players who will have things to add to the venture,” she said in an interview on Tuesday.
Woodside announced the $900 million purchase of Tellurian Inc. on Monday, and is aiming to sell down as much as 50% of the project, with the goal of reaching a final investment decision from first quarter 2025. The American LNG developer had struggled to move its Gulf Coast Driftwood project forward since its founding in 2016.
O’Neill pointed to end-users, like the Japanese gas importers that recently took stakes in Woodside’s Scarborough gas project in Australia, as an example of potential partners. She also mentioned a “high quality infrastructure company,” like Global Infrastructure Partners LP, which invested in the expansion of Woodside’s Pluto facility.
“Those companies share our vision for the role of LNG in meeting the world’s long-term energy needs,” O’Neill said. Woodside can get into advanced discussions with potential partners, but won’t sign anything binding until its deal with Tellurian is closed, she said. The transaction is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter.
Saudi Aramco, which had previously been in talks to purchase a stake in Tellurian, is another potential partner, said Saul Kavonic, an energy analyst at MST Marquee in Sydney. Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., as well as Japanese buyers and US infrastructure players, could also invest in Driftwood, he said.

Meme-Stock Investors Lose Millions on a US Energy Company Takeover 2024-07-24T17:08:48.000Z

(Bloomberg) -- For Bjorn Bos and other retail investors who piled into US energy company Tellurian Inc. in the last few years, it wasn’t meant to end this way.
Most Read from Bloomberg
Tellurian agreed this week to be swallowed up by larger rival Woodside Energy Group Ltd. for about $1 a share in cash, ending its ambition to independently develop a multibillion-dollar natural gas export terminal. For Tellurian’s army of small shareholders — many of whom bought the stock when it traded near $3 — there’s not just disappointment, but a sense of betrayal.
Of all the US companies caught up in the pandemic-ere meme-stock craze, Tellurian was arguably the unlikeliest. In contrast to AMC Entertainment Holdings (movies) or Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (retail), Tellurian was far from being a household name. It planned to construct a hugely complex liquefied natural gas facility on a patch of land near the Louisiana coast.
If anything set Tellurian apart from its industry peers, it was the company’s charismatic co-founder, Charif Souki. As Tellurian’s fundraising encountered various obstacles, he sought to tap the retail audience with a steady stream of YouTube videos, in which he railed against the short sellers he blamed for keeping the stock price artificially low.
The message resonated with investors like Bos, who lives in the Netherlands. Before the acquisition, retail buyers owned about 40% of Tellurian.
“The allure of Souki really attracted most of us,” Bos said. “I am still really beat up by this news. We lost a really big amount of savings.”
Tellurian is a cautionary tale for amateur traders hoping to outsmart Wall Street. It faced headwinds that meme-stock enthusiasts may not have fully understood: competition from energy giants like state-owned QatarEnergy, governance concerns and a business model that required the company to raise far more equity financing compared with rival LNG developers. For Bos, the lesson was a harsh one: “Never, ever, invest with money you cannot afford to lose.”
A Tellurian spokesperson declined to comment, while Souki didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment by phone and text.
Woodside’s deal to buy Tellurian for $900 million is set to close in the fourth quarter and will likely be approved passive institutional investors, who control the majority of its stock. But that’s little comfort to the retail buyers.
All of the more than 10 individual investors interviewed by Bloomberg, some with losses as high as $1 million from Tellurian, were unhappy with the outcome. Many are offloading their shares, with trading volumes hitting a record on Monday.
Souki, once one of the highest paid CEOs in the US, was a relentless pitchman for Tellurian. Aside from denouncing short sellers, he also tried to convince amateur traders that Tellurian offered a pure investment play for a fuel that would play a critical role in the transition to cleaner energy.
But while Souki is a larger-than-life figure, he’s also a controversial one. After founding Cheniere Energy Inc. nearly three decades ago and remaking it from an LNG importer into the first exporter of US shale gas, he was ousted from the company in 2015 amid a push from billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who accused Souki of overspending. Three months later, he set up Tellurian with Martin Houston — another industry veteran.
Despite the impressive pedigree of its leadership, Tellurian struggled to make progress on its LNG project, known as Driftwood. The pandemic cut demand for gas, and a deal with a potential Indian customer fell through, helping to drive its shares lower in 2020 and making it a target for short sellers.
It was around this time that retail investors began to take notice. The stock was cheap, and the community of shareholders quickly grew, creating a Discord channel and a Reddit board to swap research. And Tellurian’s share price began to recover.
Souki not only noticed this budding community, but also leaned into it, posting videos on YouTube to directly speak with these investors, while at the same time bashing the short sellers.
“The management was a huge part of it for me,” said Ryan Panno, who began investing near the end of 2020. “They had two co-founders that had started a successful company.”
The stock rode higher after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 sent gas prices surging. Europe weaned itself from Russian pipeline gas, with US LNG replacing some of that supply. Tellurian’s stock price, at a time when Driftwood remained just a concept, soared above $6.
But the company was unable to convince banks to lend them the billions of dollars required to make a final investment, while other rivals moved ahead with expansions or new projects. The stock gains evaporated, and Souki was ousted in December.
Tellurian’s remaining management will be awarded bonuses with the successful sale to Woodside, an amendment that was approved during the annual meeting in June, while retail investors are left grappling with losses. But for the top executives, the payouts agreed upon with the acquisition are down 70% versus what they would have received if Tellurian had made a final investment decision on Driftwood.
“It’s Tellurian board’s responsibility to communicate with their shareholders about the merits of the deal,” Meg O’Neill, Woodside’s chief executive officer, said in an interview earlier this week.
O’Neill said she would welcome shareholders to “invest in Woodside as a way to get the upside that they were hoping to receive by investing in Tellurian.”
That’s exactly what Panno did.
“I bought some Woodside today,” he said on Monday, after selling 80% of his Tellurian holdings. “I think they’re getting a steal.”

Woodside to Buy Ammonia Plant From OCI Global for $2.35 Billion 2024-08-05T07:10:00.000Z

Woodside Energy will buy an ammonia plant under construction in Texas for around $2.35 billion as it seeks greener assets to balance a portfolio that generates most of its profits from oil and natural gas production.
================================================================================

Woodside to Acquire OCI’S Clean Ammonia Project 2024-08-05T13:00:00.000Z

--(
)--Woodside has entered into a binding agreement to acquire 100% of OCI Clean Ammonia Holding B.V., and its lower carbon ammonia project in Beaumont, Texas (Project) for an all-cash consideration of approximately $2,350 million. The Project is under construction and targets production of first ammonia from 2025 and lower carbon ammonia from 2026. The consideration is inclusive of capital expenditure through completion of the first phase (Phase 1).
Woodside CEO Meg O’Neill said the acquisition supports Woodside’s strategy to thrive through the energy transition.
"This transaction positions Woodside in the growing lower carbon ammonia market. The potential applications for lower carbon ammonia are in power generation, marine fuels and as an industrial feedstock, as it displaces higher-emitting fuels.
"Global ammonia demand is forecast to double by 2050, with lower carbon ammonia making up nearly two-thirds of total demand.
"This Project exceeds our capital allocation framework targets for new energy projects. Both phases are expected to achieve an internal rate of return above 10 percent and payback of less than 10 years.
"This acquisition is a material step towards delivering our Scope 3 investment and abatement targets. Phase 1 has the capacity to abate 1.6 Mtpa of CO
-e and with the addition of Phase 2 the Project has the capacity to abate 3.2 Mtpa CO
-e, or over 60 percent of our Scope 3 abatement target."
The Project is located on the US Gulf Coast (Beaumont, Texas) and can serve customers domestically and internationally. Phase 1 has a design capacity of 1.1 Mtpa and is under construction. First ammonia production, derived from natural gas, is targeted for 2025. Lower carbon ammonia production, derived from natural gas paired with carbon sequestration, is targeted for 2026 following commencement of CCS operations.
Agreements for the feedstock and CCS capacity are in place. The nitrogen and lower carbon hydrogen feedstock will be sourced primarily from Linde. The Linde feedstock facility is currently under construction, targeting completion in early 2026. Ahead of completion, early supply of feedstock for the Project will come from multiple suppliers, including Linde, from available capacity in the Gulf Coast.
The CCS services will be provided to Linde by ExxonMobil and are expected to be available in 2026.
The Project will target conventional ammonia customers at start-up and will target lower carbon ammonia customers in Europe and Asia when CCS is operational.
The facility is designed to accommodate a second 1.1 Mtpa production train (Phase 2). Phase 2 remains pre-final investment decision (FID). Woodside will target FID-readiness for Phase 2 in 2026 with an expected gross capital expenditure range of $1.2 - 1.4 billion.
The Project’s competitive advantages include:
Phase 1 is expected to exceed Woodside’s capital allocation target of a 10% internal rate of return (IRR) for new energy projects, including acquisition and construction costs. It is also expected to achieve payback in less than 10 years. Phase 2 is expected to achieve improved returns leveraging common infrastructure.
The Project returns benefit from:
Forecast IRR and payback period are a look forward from July 2024 and assume Woodside equity of 100% and include the acquisition price. Lower carbon ammonia price assumes an uplift to Woodside’s internal unabated ammonia cost assumption. In 2025 the uplift is $0/t increasing to ~$120/t in 2034 (real terms 2024) aligned with the phase-in of the EU carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM). Payback period is calculated from undiscounted cash flows from ready for start up (RFSU).
Lower carbon ammonia demand is forecast to grow through the energy transition. The current ammonia market is nearly 200 Mtpa, of which approximately 80% is used for fertiliser applications with the remainder used for various industrial applications. Lower carbon ammonia demand will be driven by the decarbonisation of traditional end-use sectors and emerging applications in marine fuels, power generation and as a hydrogen carrier.
Europe and Asia are forecast to be the largest demand centres for lower carbon hydrogen and ammonia driven by supportive policies. The EU CBAM imposes a levy on imports of carbon intensive goods based on carbon intensity. This results in a carbon tax saving for lower carbon ammonia relative to unabated ammonia. In Japan and South Korea, demand is expected to be driven by supportive ‘contract for difference’ subsidy schemes, which aim to cover the difference between the prices of lower carbon fuels and conventional fossil fuels. The Project’s designed carbon intensity is expected to qualify for these schemes.
Under the transaction, Woodside will acquire 100% of the equity of OCI Clean Ammonia Holding B.V., which indirectly wholly owns the Project, from OCI N.V. (together with its affiliates: "OCI").
The Project is subject to cost, schedule and performance guarantees from OCI. This means that OCI will manage the construction of the Project through provisional acceptance, will fund Project costs through Project completion and has agreed to liquidated damages for certain delays, reducing cost and schedule risk.
The transaction includes the transfer of experienced personnel with start-up, operational, maintenance and technical capabilities for the operation of the asset.
The transaction is targeted to complete in the second half of the 2024 and is subject to OCI N.V.’s shareholder vote and satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.
Woodside is a global energy company, providing reliable and affordable energy to help people lead better lives. Woodside led the development of the LNG industry in Australia. With a focused portfolio, Woodside is recognised for its world-class capabilities as an integrated upstream supplier of energy. Woodside’s proven track record and distinctive capabilities are underpinned by 70 years of experience.
OCI N.V. operates as a producer and distributor of natural gas-based fertilisers and industrial chemicals. OCI N.V. produces nitrogen fertilisers, methanol, and other natural gas based chemical products, serving agricultural and industrial clients globally.
A conference call providing an overview of the transaction with a question and answer session will be hosted by Woodside CEO and Managing Director Meg O’Neill on Monday, 5 August 2024 at
17:30 AEST/15:30 AWST/02:30 CDT.

Woodside to acquire OCI’s US clean ammonia project for $2.35bn 2024-08-06T08:36:29.000Z

Australian energy major Woodside has announced a definitive agreement to purchase OCI Clean Ammonia from OCI Global for $2.35bn (A$3.62bn).
The acquisition is expected to bolster Woodside’s position in the lower-carbon ammonia market, which is seeing increased demand as the energy industry pivots towards more sustainable solutions.
The asset in question is a clean ammonia project currently under construction in Beaumont, Texas.
Woodside will pay 80% of the purchase price upon closing the transaction, with the remaining balance due at project completion, which is contingent on meeting specific terms and conditions.
The deal includes capital expenditure (capex) through the completion of the project's first phase.
Phase 1 of the project has a design capacity of 1.1 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) and aims to commence ammonia production from natural gas by 2025.
Subsequently the facility will focus on lower-carbon ammonia production, which involves natural gas combined with carbon capture and storage (CCS), targeted to start in 2026.
OCI will retain control over the construction, commissioning and start-up of the facility, directing contractors until the project is fully operational. Once the facility is staffed and operational, control will transition to Woodside.
The project has secured agreements for feedstock and CCS capacity, with Linde providing the nitrogen and lower-carbon hydrogen feedstock from a facility that is due to be completed in early 2026.
In the interim, feedstock will be supplied by Linde and other Gulf Coast suppliers.
The CCS services will be provided by ExxonMobil, beginning in 2026.
Initially, the project will serve conventional ammonia customers, with plans to cater to lower-carbon ammonia clients in Europe and Asia once CCS is operational.
The facility has been designed to accommodate a second production train, with Woodside aiming for final investment decision-readiness for this phase in 2026 and projecting gross capex of $1.2bn–1.4bn.
Woodside CEO Meg O’Neill said: “This transaction positions Woodside in the growing lower-carbon ammonia market. The potential applications for lower-carbon ammonia are in power generation, marine fuels and as an industrial feedstock, as it displaces higher-emitting fuels.
“Global ammonia demand is forecast to double by 2050, with lower-carbon ammonia making up nearly two-thirds of total demand. This project exceeds our capital allocation framework targets for new energy projects. Both phases are expected to achieve an internal rate of return above 10% and payback of less than ten years.”
The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2024, subject to OCI shareholder approval and customary conditions.
This acquisition follows Woodside Energy's 
 Tellurian, a US-based LNG company, for $1.2bn.
