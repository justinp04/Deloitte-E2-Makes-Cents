Woolworths Group Limited (ASX:WOW) Stock's Been Sliding But Fundamentals Look Decent: Will The Market Correct The Share Price In The Future? 2023-08-21T05:15:32.000Z

With its stock down 3.5% over the past month, it is easy to disregard Woolworths Group (ASX:WOW). However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. Specifically, we decided to study 
 ROE in this article.
Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.
The 
 is:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Woolworths Group is:
27% = AU$1.7b ÷ AU$6.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2023).
The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each A$1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made A$0.27 in profit.
We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or "retain", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.
Firstly, we acknowledge that Woolworths Group has a significantly high ROE. Further, even comparing with the industry average if 24%, the company's ROE is quite respectable. Despite this, Woolworths Group's five year net income growth was quite flat over the past five years. We reckon that there could be some other factors at play here that's limiting the company's growth. These include low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.
Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that the industry grew its earnings by 19% over the last few years.
The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. If you're wondering about Woolworths Group's's valuation, check out 
, as compared to its industry.
With a high three-year median payout ratio of 88% (implying that the company keeps only 12% of its income) of its business to reinvest into its business), most of Woolworths Group's profits are being paid to shareholders, which explains the absence of growth in earnings.
In addition, Woolworths Group has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 75%. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 26%.
On the whole, we do feel that Woolworths Group has some positive attributes. Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a high ROE. Bear in mind, the company reinvests a small portion of its profits, which means that investors aren't reaping the benefits of the high rate of return. That being so, the latest industry analyst forecasts show that the analysts are expecting to see a huge improvement in the company's earnings growth rate.

Here's What Analysts Are Forecasting For Woolworths Group Limited (ASX:WOW) After Its Annual Results 2023-08-24T03:29:37.000Z

 (
) shareholders are probably feeling a little disappointed, since its shares fell 2.2% to AU$37.49 in the week after its latest yearly results. It looks like the results were a bit of a negative overall. While revenues of AU$64b were in line with analyst predictions, statutory earnings were less than expected, missing estimates by 2.5% to hit AU$1.32 per share. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on Woolworths Group after the latest results.
Taking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for Woolworths Group from 16 analysts is for revenues of AU$67.0b in 2024. If met, it would imply a modest 4.3% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to swell 14% to AU$1.52. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of AU$67.1b and earnings per share (EPS) of AU$1.52 in 2024. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates.
There were no changes to revenue or earnings estimates or the price target of AU$38.75, suggesting that the company has met expectations in its recent result. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. There are some variant perceptions on Woolworths Group, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at AU$43.00 and the most bearish at AU$27.00 per share. These price targets show that analysts do have some differing views on the business, but the estimates do not vary enough to suggest to us that some are betting on wild success or utter failure.
These estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the Woolworths Group's past performance and to peers in the same 
. The analysts are definitely expecting Woolworths Group's growth to accelerate, with the forecast 4.3% annualised growth to the end of 2024 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 1.2% per annum over the past five years. Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to grow their revenue 3.0% annually. It seems obvious that, while the growth outlook is brighter than the recent past, the analysts also expect Woolworths Group to grow faster than the wider industry.
The most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. Happily, there were no major changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.
Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. We have forecasts for Woolworths Group going out to 2026, and you can

Woolworths Group's (ASX:WOW) Upcoming Dividend Will Be Larger Than Last Year's 2023-08-25T20:10:21.000Z

 (
) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 27th of September to A$0.58. Despite this raise, the dividend yield of 2.8% is only a modest boost to shareholder returns.
It would be nice for the yield to be higher, but we should also check if higher levels of dividend payment would be sustainable. Prior to this announcement, Woolworths Group's dividend made up quite a large proportion of earnings but only 57% of free cash flows. Since the dividend is just paying out cash to shareholders, we care more about the cash payout ratio from which we can see plenty is being left over for reinvestment in the business.
Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 28.8%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 58%, which would make us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend, despite the levels currently being quite high.
The company has a long dividend track record, but it doesn't look great with cuts in the past. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was A$1.29, compared to the most recent full-year payment of A$1.04. Doing the maths, this is a decline of about 2.1% per year. Generally, we don't like to see a dividend that has been declining over time as this can degrade shareholders' returns and indicate that the company may be running into problems.
With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share is growing. However, Woolworths Group's EPS was effectively flat over the past five years, which could stop the company from paying more every year. There are exceptions, but limited earnings growth and a high payout ratio can signal that a company has reached maturity. This isn't the end of the world, but for investors looking for strong dividend growth they may want to look elsewhere.
Overall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think Woolworths Group will make a great income stock. In the past, the payments have been unstable, but over the short term the dividend could be reliable, with the company generating enough cash to cover it. We don't think Woolworths Group is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.
Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For example, we've picked out

Woolworths Group Limited (ASX:WOW) Will Pay A AU$0.58 Dividend In Four Days 2023-08-26T22:19:01.000Z

Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see 
 (
) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Thus, you can purchase Woolworths Group's shares before the 31st of August in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 27th of September.
The company's upcoming dividend is AU$0.58 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of AU$1.04 per share to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Woolworths Group has a trailing yield of approximately 2.8% on its current stock price of A$37.41. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Woolworths Group's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to investigate whether Woolworths Group can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow.
Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Its dividend payout ratio is 78% of profit, which means the company is paying out a majority of its earnings. The relatively limited profit reinvestment could slow the rate of future earnings growth. We'd be concerned if earnings began to decline. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. It distributed 46% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.
It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.
Click 
Companies that aren't growing their earnings can still be valuable, but it is even more important to assess the sustainability of the dividend if it looks like the company will struggle to grow. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. With that in mind, we're not enthused to see that Woolworths Group's earnings per share have remained effectively flat over the past five years. Better than seeing them fall off a cliff, for sure, but the best dividend stocks grow their earnings meaningfully over the long run. A high payout ratio of 78% generally happens when a company can't find better uses for the cash. Combined with slim earnings growth in the past few years, Woolworths Group could be signalling that its future growth prospects are thin.
Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Woolworths Group's dividend payments per share have declined at 2.1% per year on average over the past 10 years, which is uninspiring.
Is Woolworths Group an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? It's unfortunate that earnings per share have not grown, and we'd note that Woolworths Group is paying out lower percentage of its cashflow than its profit, but overall the dividend looks well covered by earnings. To summarise, Woolworths Group looks okay on this analysis, although it doesn't appear a stand-out opportunity.

Here's Why We Think Woolworths Group (ASX:WOW) Might Deserve Your Attention Today 2023-09-16T22:17:18.000Z

It's common for many investors, especially those who are inexperienced, to buy shares in companies with a good story even if these companies are loss-making. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.
If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in 
 (
). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.
If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Shareholders will be happy to know that Woolworths Group's EPS has grown 23% each year, compound, over three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.
One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. EBIT margins for Woolworths Group remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 5.7% to AU$64b. That's progress.

Investors are always searching for a vote of confidence in the companies they hold and insider buying is one of the key indicators for optimism on the market. That's because insider buying often indicates that those closest to the company have confidence that the share price will perform well. Of course, we can never be sure what insiders are thinking, we can only judge their actions.
With strong conviction, Woolworths Group insiders have stood united by refusing to sell shares over the last year. But more importantly, Independent Non-Executive Director Tracey Fellows spent AU$95k acquiring shares, doing so at an average price of AU$37.76. Strong buying like that could be a sign of opportunity.
The good news, alongside the insider buying, for Woolworths Group bulls is that insiders (collectively) have a meaningful investment in the stock. As a matter of fact, their holding is valued at AU$23m. That shows significant buy-in, and may indicate conviction in the business strategy. While their ownership only accounts for 0.05%, this is still a considerable amount at stake to encourage the business to maintain a strategy that will deliver value to shareholders.
For growth investors, Woolworths Group's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. Moreover, the management and board of the company hold a significant stake in the company, with one party adding to this total. These things considered, this is one stock worth watching. While we've looked at the quality of the earnings, we haven't yet done any work to value the stock. So if you like to buy cheap, you may want to

Are Woolworths Group Limited (ASX:WOW) Investors Paying Above The Intrinsic Value? 2023-10-05T23:17:10.000Z

Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Woolworths Group Limited (
) as an investment opportunity by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.
Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the 
 may be something of interest to you.
We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:
 = AU$14b
We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.1%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$1.5b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.1%– 2.0%) = AU$38b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$38b÷ ( 1 + 6.1%)
= AU$21b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is AU$35b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of AU$37.5, the company appears potentially overvalued at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.
The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Woolworths Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.815. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price exceeding the intrinsic value? For Woolworths Group, we've compiled three pertinent elements you should assess:

Those who invested in Woolworths Group (ASX:WOW) five years ago are up 60% 2023-11-07T01:27:35.000Z

Generally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, the 
 (
) share price is up 18% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 14% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 10% , including dividends .
Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns.
While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.
During five years of share price growth, Woolworths Group achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 1.5% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 3% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.
You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).
It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our 
 
.
When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between 
 (TSR) and 
. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Woolworths Group the TSR over the last 5 years was 60%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!
It's good to see that Woolworths Group has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 10% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 10% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks, for example - Woolworths Group has

Has Woolworths Group Limited (ASX:WOW) Stock's Recent Performance Got Anything to Do With Its Financial Health? 2024-01-29T00:26:57.000Z

Woolworths Group's (ASX:WOW) stock is up by 3.7% over the past three months. As most would know, long-term fundamentals have a strong correlation with market price movements, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. Specifically, we decided to study 
 ROE in this article.
ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Woolworths Group is:
25% = AU$1.6b ÷ AU$6.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).
The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each A$1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made A$0.25 in profit.
Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or "retains" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.
First thing first, we like that Woolworths Group has an impressive ROE. Further, even comparing with the industry average if 24%, the company's ROE is quite respectable. Given the circumstances, we can't help but wonder why Woolworths Group saw little to no growth in the past five years. We reckon that there could be some other factors at play here that's limiting the company's growth. Such as, the company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures.
Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Woolworths Group's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 19% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see.
Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for WOW? You can find out in
Woolworths Group has a high three-year median payout ratio of 85% (or a retention ratio of 15%), meaning that the company is paying most of its profits as dividends to its shareholders. This does go some way in explaining why there's been no growth in its earnings.
Additionally, Woolworths Group has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 74%. As a result, Woolworths Group's ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 26% for future ROE.
On the whole, we do feel that Woolworths Group has some positive attributes. However, while the company does have a high ROE, its earnings growth number is quite disappointing. This can be blamed on the fact that it reinvests only a small portion of its profits and pays out the rest as dividends. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

Analysts Have Made A Financial Statement On Woolworths Group Limited's (ASX:WOW) Interim Report 2024-02-22T04:44:42.000Z

Shareholders might have noticed that 
 (
) filed its interim result this time last week. The early response was not positive, with shares down 5.6% to AU$33.50 in the past week. It was a credible result overall, with revenues of AU$35b and statutory earnings per share of AU$1.32 both in line with analyst estimates, showing that Woolworths Group is executing in line with expectations. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year.
Taking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for Woolworths Group from 14 analysts is for revenues of AU$67.4b in 2024. If met, it would imply a modest 2.4% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Woolworths Group is also expected to turn profitable, with statutory earnings of AU$0.23 per share. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of AU$68.0b and earnings per share (EPS) of AU$0.27 in 2024. The analysts seem to have become more bearish following the latest results. While there were no changes to revenue forecasts, there was a substantial drop in EPS estimates.
It might be a surprise to learn that the consensus price target was broadly unchanged at AU$36.54, with the analysts clearly implying that the forecast decline in earnings is not expected to have much of an impact on valuation. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. The most optimistic Woolworths Group analyst has a price target of AU$42.00 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at AU$27.50. These price targets show that analysts do have some differing views on the business, but the estimates do not vary enough to suggest to us that some are betting on wild success or utter failure.
Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the 
. The analysts are definitely expecting Woolworths Group's growth to accelerate, with the forecast 5.0% annualised growth to the end of 2024 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 2.1% per annum over the past five years. Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to grow their revenue 3.5% annually. It seems obvious that, while the growth outlook is brighter than the recent past, the analysts also expect Woolworths Group to grow faster than the wider industry.
The most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results. Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.
Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for Woolworths Group going out to 2026, and you can

The company's next dividend payment will be AU$0.47 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of AU$1.04 per share. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Woolworths Group has a trailing yield of approximately 3.2% on its current stock price of AU$32.78. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. As a result, readers should always check whether Woolworths Group has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut.
Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Woolworths Group's dividend is not well covered by earnings, as the company lost money last year. This is not a sustainable state of affairs, so it would be worth investigating if earnings are expected to recover. With the recent loss, it's important to check if the business generated enough cash to pay its dividend. If cash earnings don't cover the dividend, the company would have to pay dividends out of cash in the bank, or by borrowing money, neither of which is long-term sustainable. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 41% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.

Companies with falling earnings are riskier for dividend shareholders. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. Woolworths Group reported a loss last year, and the general trend suggests its earnings have also been declining in recent years, making us wonder if the dividend is at risk.
Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Woolworths Group's dividend payments per share have declined at 2.4% per year on average over the past 10 years, which is uninspiring. While it's not great that earnings and dividends per share have fallen in recent years, we're encouraged by the fact that management has trimmed the dividend rather than risk over-committing the company in a risky attempt to maintain yields to shareholders.

From a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Woolworths Group? First, it's not great to see the company paying a dividend despite being loss-making over the last year. On the plus side, the dividend was covered by free cash flow." It's not that we think Woolworths Group is a bad company, but these characteristics don't generally lead to outstanding dividend performance.

Woolworths Group's (ASX:WOW) Dividend Will Be A$0.47 2024-02-26T21:06:37.000Z

 (
) has announced that it will pay a dividend of A$0.47 per share on the 11th of April. This takes the annual payment to 3.2% of the current stock price, which is about average for the industry.
We like a dividend to be consistent over the long term, so checking whether it is sustainable is important. Even though Woolworths Group isn't generating a profit, it is generating healthy free cash flows that easily cover the dividend. In general, cash flows are more important than the more traditional measures of profit so we feel pretty comfortable with the dividend at this level.
Earnings per share is forecast to rise exponentially over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio could reach 14,572%, which is unsustainable.
Although the company has a long dividend history, it has been cut at least once in the last 10 years. The dividend has gone from an annual total of A$1.33 in 2014 to the most recent total annual payment of A$1.04. Doing the maths, this is a decline of about 2.4% per year. Generally, we don't like to see a dividend that has been declining over time as this can degrade shareholders' returns and indicate that the company may be running into problems.
With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share is growing. Over the past five years, it looks as though Woolworths Group's EPS has declined at around 4.9% a year. If earnings continue declining, the company may have to make the difficult choice of reducing the dividend or even stopping it completely - the opposite of dividend growth. Earnings are predicted to grow over the next year, but we would remain cautious until a track record of earnings growth is established.
Overall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think Woolworths Group will make a great income stock. The company is generating plenty of cash, which could maintain the dividend for a while, but the track record hasn't been great. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.
Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. For example, we've identified

Woolworths Group Ltd's Dividend Analysis 2024-02-27T13:15:08.000Z

Woolworths Group Ltd (
) recently announced a 
 of $0.47 per share, payable on 2024-04-11, with the ex-dividend date set for 2024-02-28. As investors look forward to this upcoming payment, the spotlight also shines on the company's dividend history, yield, and growth rates. Using the data from GuruFocus, let's look into Woolworths Group Ltd's dividend performance and assess its sustainability.
Woolworths Group Ltd is Australia's largest retailer, with operations that include supermarkets in Australia and New Zealand, as well as the Big W discount department stores. The Australian food division is the primary contributor to the group's EBIT, followed by New Zealand supermarkets, while Big W offers a smaller contribution to the overall earnings.
Woolworths Group Ltd has maintained a consistent 
 record since 2020, with dividends currently distributed on a bi-annual basis. Below is a chart showing annual 
 for tracking historical trends.
As of today, Woolworths Group Ltd currently has a 12-month 
 of 3.16% and a 12-month 
 of 2.85%, suggesting an expectation of decreased dividend payments over the next 12 months.
Over the past three years, Woolworths Group Ltd's annual 
 was -1.30%. Extended to a five-year horizon, this rate increased to 0.80% per year. And over the past decade, Woolworths Group Ltd's annual dividends per share growth rate stands at -3.30%.
Based on Woolworths Group Ltd's dividend yield and five-year growth rate, the 
 of Woolworths Group Ltd stock as of today is approximately 3.29%.
To assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The 
 provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-12-31, Woolworths Group Ltd's dividend payout ratio is 77.44, which may suggest that the company's dividend may not be sustainable.
Woolworths Group Ltd's 
, offers an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers. GuruFocus ranks Woolworths Group Ltd's profitability 6 out of 10 as of 2023-12-31, suggesting fair profitability. The company has reported net profit in 9 years out of the past 10 years.
To ensure the sustainability of dividends, a company must have robust growth metrics. Woolworths Group Ltd's 
 of 6 out of 10 suggests that the company has a fair growth outlook.
Revenue is the lifeblood of any company, and Woolworths Group Ltd's 
, combined with the 
, indicates a strong revenue model. Woolworths Group Ltd's revenue has increased by approximately 1.40% per year on average, a rate that underperforms approximately 67.01% of global competitors.
The company's 
 showcases its capability to grow its earnings, a critical component for sustaining dividends in the long run. During the past three years, Woolworths Group Ltd's earnings increased by approximately 3.50% per year on average, a rate that underperforms approximately 68.31% of global competitors.
Lastly, the company's 
 of 1.00%, which underperforms approximately 75.86% of global competitors.
Considering Woolworths Group Ltd's dividend payments, growth rate, payout ratio, profitability, and growth metrics, investors should weigh these factors carefully. While the company has a history of consistent dividend payments, the negative growth rates and the high payout ratio could be areas of concern. The fair profitability and growth outlook provide some reassurance, but the underperformance in revenue and earnings growth compared to global competitors might raise questions about long-term sustainability. Value investors should keep a close eye on Woolworths Group Ltd's financial health and market position to make informed decisions about their investment portfolios.

A Look At The Fair Value Of Woolworths Group Limited (ASX:WOW) 2024-04-07T23:39:12.000Z

Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Woolworths Group Limited (
) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!
We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the 
.
We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:
 = AU$14b
After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.0%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$1.4b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.0%– 2.2%) = AU$38b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$38b÷ ( 1 + 6.0%)
= AU$21b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is AU$35b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of AU$32.5, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.
The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Woolworths Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.843. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For Woolworths Group, we've put together three additional elements you should explore:

The past three years for Woolworths Group (ASX:WOW) investors has not been profitable 2024-05-23T02:49:56.000Z

As an investor its worth striving to ensure your overall portfolio beats the market average. But in any portfolio, there are likely to be some stocks that fall short of that benchmark. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term 
 (
) shareholders, since the share price is down 25% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 24%.
With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.
To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.
Woolworths Group saw its share price decline over the three years in which its EPS also dropped, falling to a loss. This was, in part, due to extraordinary items impacting earnings. Due to the loss, it's not easy to use EPS as a reliable guide to the business. However, we can say we'd expect to see a falling share price in this scenario.
The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).
It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our 
 
.
It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Woolworths Group's TSR for the last 3 years was -4.0%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!
Woolworths Group shareholders are down 15% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 13%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 6% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks, for example - Woolworths Group has
