We Wouldn't Be Too Quick To Buy Australian Foundation Investment Company Limited (ASX:AFI) Before It Goes Ex-Dividend

It looks like 
 (
) is about to go ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. In other words, investors can purchase Australian Foundation Investment's shares before the 11th of August in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 1st of September.
The company's upcoming dividend is AU$0.14 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of AU$0.25 per share to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Australian Foundation Investment has a trailing yield of 3.5% on the current share price of A$7.21. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing.
Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Australian Foundation Investment paid out 100% of its earnings, which is more than we're comfortable with, unless there are mitigating circumstances.
When a company pays out a dividend that is not well covered by profits, the dividend is generally seen as more vulnerable to being cut.

Companies that aren't growing their earnings can still be valuable, but it is even more important to assess the sustainability of the dividend if it looks like the company will struggle to grow. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. With that in mind, we're not enthused to see that Australian Foundation Investment's earnings per share have remained effectively flat over the past five years. We'd take that over an earnings decline any day, but in the long run, the best dividend stocks all grow their earnings per share.
Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Australian Foundation Investment has lifted its dividend by approximately 1.3% a year on average.
Has Australian Foundation Investment got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Australian Foundation Investment's earnings have barely moved in recent times, and the company is paying out a disagreeably high percentage of its earnings; a mediocre combination. These characteristics don't generally lead to outstanding dividend performance, and investors may not be happy with the results of owning this stock for its dividend.
With that being said, if you're still considering Australian Foundation Investment as an investment, you'll find it beneficial to know what risks this stock is facing. Our analysis shows 
 and you should be aware of them before buying any shares.
Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's

Australian Foundation Investment (ASX:AFI) Has Announced A Dividend Of A$0.115

The board of 
 (
) has announced that it will pay a dividend of A$0.115 per share on the 26th of February. The payment will take the dividend yield to 3.3%, which is in line with the average for the industry.
We aren't too impressed by dividend yields unless they can be sustained over time. Prior to this announcement, the company was paying out 107% of what it was earning. Without profits and cash flows increasing, it would be difficult for the company to continue paying the dividend at this level.
If the company can't turn things around, EPS could fall by 5.9% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we believe the payout ratio could reach 115%, which could put the dividend under pressure if earnings don't start to improve.
The company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. The dividend has gone from an annual total of A$0.22 in 2014 to the most recent total annual payment of A$0.25. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 1.3% a year over that time. Slow and steady dividend growth might not sound that exciting, but dividends have been stable for ten years, which we think makes this a fairly attractive offer.
Investors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Unfortunately things aren't as good as they seem. It's not great to see that Australian Foundation Investment's earnings per share has fallen at approximately 5.9% per year over the past five years. If earnings continue declining, the company may have to make the difficult choice of reducing the dividend or even stopping it completely - the opposite of dividend growth.
Overall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think Australian Foundation Investment will make a great income stock. Although they have been consistent in the past, we think the payments are a little high to be sustained. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.
Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 
 that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. If you are a dividend investor, you might also want to look at our

Investing in Australian Foundation Investment (ASX:AFI) five years ago would have delivered you a 43% gain

Passive investing in index funds can generate returns that roughly match the overall market. But the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the 
 (
) share price is 21% higher than it was five years ago, which is more than the market average. In stark contrast, the stock price has actually fallen 1.2% in the last year.
With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.
To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.
During five years of share price growth, Australian Foundation Investment actually saw its EPS drop 5.9% per year.
The strong decline in earnings per share suggests the market isn't using EPS to judge the company. Given that EPS is down, but the share price is up, it seems clear the market is focussed on other aspects of the business, at the moment.
It is not great to see that revenue has dropped by 0.2% per year over five years. So it seems one might have to take closer look at earnings and revenue trends to see how they might influence the share price.
The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).
It's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our

When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between 
 (TSR) and 
. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Australian Foundation Investment, it has a TSR of 43% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!
Australian Foundation Investment shareholders gained a total return of 2.3% during the year. Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. On the bright side, the longer term returns (running at about 7% a year, over half a decade) look better. Maybe the share price is just taking a breather while the business executes on its growth strategy. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

Unveiling 3 ASX Dividend Stocks With Yields Up To 9.9%

The Australian stock market has shown resilience with a 7.0% increase over the past year, despite a flat performance in the last week, and earnings are expected to grow by 13% annually. In this context, dividend stocks can be particularly appealing as they offer potential for steady income streams and can serve as a buffer in varied market conditions.
We're going to check out a few of the best picks from our screener tool.
 ★★★★☆☆
 Australian Foundation Investment Company Limited, a publicly owned investment manager, operates with a market capitalization of approximately A$9.26 billion.
 Australian Foundation Investment Company Limited does not have detailed revenue segments provided in the text.
 3.4%
Australian Foundation Investment (AFI) offers a dividend yield of 3.45%, which is lower than the top Australian dividend payers. Despite a stable history over the past decade, AFI's dividends are not well covered by free cash flow or earnings, with payout ratios of 110.3% and 77.7% respectively, indicating potential sustainability issues. Recent financials show a decline in revenue and net income from A$350.01 million and A$309.76 million to A$339.26 million and A$296.17 million respectively, year-over-year.
 ★★★★☆☆
 Ampol Limited, operating in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United States, engages in the purchasing, refining, distribution, and marketing of petroleum products with a market capitalization of A$7.94 billion.
 Ampol Limited generates revenue through its Z Energy segment at A$5.51 billion, Convenience Retail at A$5.99 billion, and Fuels and Infrastructure at A$33.63 billion.
 8.3%
Ampol Limited, despite a dividend yield of 8.26%, faces challenges with sustainability and reliability in its dividend distributions. The company's dividends are not well covered by earnings, with a high payout ratio of 93.3%, and have shown volatility over the past decade. Additionally, Ampol trades at 24.3% below estimated fair value and carries a high level of debt, which could impact future financial stability and dividend payments. Recent board changes also add an element of uncertainty to the governance landscape.
 ★★★★★☆
 Fortescue Ltd is a global iron ore company based in Australia, focusing on the exploration, development, production, and processing of iron ore, with a market capitalization of approximately A$62.60 billion.
 Fortescue Ltd generates revenue primarily from its metals segment, which brought in A$18.47 billion, and a smaller contribution from the energy sector at A$79 million.
 10%
Fortescue's dividend history shows growth over the last decade, but with volatile payments. Currently trading 21.2% below its fair value, it offers a yield of 9.99%, placing it in the top quartile of Australian dividend stocks. However, forecasts suggest a potential earnings decline averaging 22.9% annually over the next three years. Dividends are supported by both earnings and cash flows with payout ratios at 74.2% and 73.1%, respectively, though this could be challenged by future earnings decreases.

Australian Foundation Investment (ASX:AFI) shareholders have earned a 5.9% CAGR over the last five years

If you want to compound wealth in the stock market, you can do so by buying an index fund. But the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the 
 (
) share price is up 11% in the last five years, slightly above the market return. In comparison, the share price is down 7.1% in a year.
With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.
While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).
Over half a decade, Australian Foundation Investment managed to grow its earnings per share at 1.1% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 2% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.
The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).
We consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Australian Foundation Investment's 
.
As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Australian Foundation Investment the TSR over the last 5 years was 33%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!
Investors in Australian Foundation Investment had a tough year, with a total loss of 3.9% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 4.7%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 6% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 
 you should know about.
