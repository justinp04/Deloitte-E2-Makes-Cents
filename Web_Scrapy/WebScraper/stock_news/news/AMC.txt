The E-Commerce Lab within the AICE conducts tests and certifies packaging according to International Safe Transit Association 6 standards.
This ensures that packaging is suitable for distribution through Amazon and other e-commerce platforms.
Amcor also plans to add a Packaging and Recycling Test Center, which will simulate brands’ packing lines for in-house machine trials and assess packaging recyclability.
In line with Amcor’s vision to make all its packaging recyclable, compostable, or reusable by 2025, the AICE building has been developed to Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology sustainability standards.

Amcor (AMCR) Down 0.7% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Rebound?

It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Amcor (AMCR). Shares have lost about 0.7% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.
Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Amcor due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.
Amcor reported third-quarter fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of approximately 18 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 17 cents. This represents a 1.7% increase from the year-ago quarter, marking a return to growth after four consecutive quarters of decline. The growth is primarily attributed to the realization of benefits from structural cost initiatives.
Including special items, the company reported earnings per share (EPS) of 13 cents compared with 12 cents in the year-ago quarter.
Total revenues fell 7% year over year to $3.4 billion. The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.53 billion.
The price/mix had an unfavorable impact of around 3% on sales. Volume was down 4% from the year-ago quarter owing to weak demand in healthcare categories and the North America beverage business. Acquisitions contributed 1% to growth. A 1% favorable impact of movements in foreign exchange rates was offset by a 2% impact of pass-through of lower raw material costs.
 
Although volume growth remained negative, it was better than expected and improved from the 10% decline reported in the second quarter of fiscal 2024.
The cost of sales was down 9% year over year to $2.7 billion. Gross profit rose 3% year over year to $692 million. The gross margin was 20.3% compared with the year-ago quarter’s 18.4%.
SG&A expenses were $330 million, reflecting an increase of 4% year over year. Adjusted operating income was $397 million, up 4% from $382 million in the year-ago quarter. Strong cost performance and benefits from restructuring initiatives helped offset the impact of lower volumes and unfavorable impacts from price/mix.
The adjusted operating margin was 11.6% compared with 10.4% in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $499 million compared with $484 million in the prior-year quarter.
: Net sales decreased 7% year over year to $2.6 billion. Volume was down 2% year over year due to destocking in healthcare categories and price/mix was an unfavorable 4%.
The segment’s adjusted operating income moved up 6% year over year to $358 million reflecting gains from strong cost performance and restructuring actions.
: The segment reported net sales of $813 million in the quarter, down 8% from the year-ago quarter. Volume was down 8% year over year reflecting lower beverage volumes amid weak demand in key categories. This was somewhat offset by a favorable price/mix impact of 1%.
Adjusted operating income was $71 million, up 3% year over year as favorable cost performance helped offset the impact of lower volumes.
As of the end of third-quarter fiscal 2024, Amcor had $457 million of cash and cash equivalents compared with $689 million as of fiscal 2023 end. The company generated $378 million of cash in operating activities in the first nine-month period of fiscal 2024 compared with $329 million in the year-ago comparable period.
As of Mar 31, 2024, Amcor’s net debt totaled $6.7 billion, up from $6.1 billion as of Jun 30, 2023.
Amcor returned $572 million to shareholders in the nine-month period ended Mar 31, 2024, through dividends and share repurchases. It has targeted total share repurchases of $70 million for fiscal 2024. Amcor’s board of directors had earlier raised its quarterly cash dividend to 12.5 cents per share from the previous payout of 12 cents per share.
The company updated its adjusted EPS to 68.5-71 cents from its prior stated 67-71 cents for fiscal 2024. AMCR projects an adjusted free cash flow of $850-$950 million for fiscal 2024.
Analysts were quiet during the last two month period as none of them issued any earnings estimate revisions.
At this time, Amcor has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a D. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.
Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.
Amcor has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.

Investors who have held Amcor (NYSE:AMCR) over the last three years have watched its earnings decline along with their investment

While not a mind-blowing move, it is good to see that the 
 (
) share price has gained 11% in the last three months. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last three years have been less than pleasing. After all, the share price is down 16% in the last three years, significantly under-performing the market.
Although the past week has been more reassuring for shareholders, they're still in the red over the last three years, so let's see if the underlying business has been responsible for the decline.
To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.
During the three years that the share price fell, Amcor's earnings per share (EPS) dropped by 6.6% each year. This fall in EPS isn't far from the rate of share price decline, which was 6% per year. So it seems that investor expectations of the company are staying pretty steady, despite the disappointment. It seems like the share price is reflecting the declining earnings per share.
You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).
It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our

It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Amcor's TSR for the last 3 years was -3.6%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the 
 shareholder return.
Amcor shareholders gained a total return of 7.3% during the year. Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. The silver lining is that the gain was actually better than the average annual return of 3% per year over five year. This could indicate that the company is winning over new investors, as it pursues its strategy. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

LVMH teams up with Amcor to launch plastic-free foil for Moët & Chandon

LVMH has worked with packaging group Amcor to develop a plastic-free foil to use on the drinks giant’s Moët & Chandon Champagnes.
The production of the foil, made of aluminium and paper, will start in October.
In a statement, Amcor said replacing plastic with paper gives the material a carbon footprint that is 31% lower “compared to standard polylaminate foils”. The company said it used a life-cycle assessment tool verified by The Carbon Trust.
The material contains around 60% aluminum. Amcor’s pointed to aluminium’s recyclability and its “aesthetic properties”. The company said it “fits the bottle perfectly and can be customised according to market requirements”.
Amcor, which has dubbed the plastic-free foil Essentielle, makes the material at its site in Mareuil-sur-Aÿ in Champagne.
Yannick Magnon, the MD of the company’s Amcor Capsules unit, said: “Amcor Capsules is drawing on Essentielle to revolutionise the industry by offering a recyclable, plastic-free solution that suits the fast pace of their packaging lines, confirming its major role among wine-growing players, here in Champagne.”
Amcor said initially the plastic-free foil will only be available with texturing to allow wine producers “to retain the premium look of their bottles and the productivity of their packaging lines”.
A version of the foil with a smooth finish will be available during the first quarter of next year.
Sibylle Scherer, the president and CEO of LVMH’s Maison Moët unit, said: “At Moët et Chandon, we are proud to support and accelerate innovation within the Champagne sector. We have been spearheading initiatives to reduce our environmental impact and cut carbon emissions.”

The Zacks Containers - Paper and Packaging industry comprises companies that manufacture paper and plastic packaging products. The packaging solutions provided by the industry help protect and preserve products, extend the shelf life, and cut down on wastage and loss across the wide and lengthy range of distribution channels.

: Industry participants have been witnessing declines in volumes due to lower consumer spending on goods, which mainly reflected the persisting inflationary scenario. Also, customers have been lowering their inventory, which had built up in response to high demand and supply-chain issues. This had an impact on the top-line performances of packaging companies. They also encountered supply-chain disruptions, and higher material, labor and transportation costs.
The companies have been implementing cost-reduction actions for a while in this situation to sustain margins.

Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group's earnings growth potential. Over the past 12 months, the industry's earnings estimates for 2024 and 2025 have both moved down 7%.

: The company's Beauty segment will continue to gain from increased demand for beauty and personal care markets. The Pharma segment is benefitting from steady demand growth for prescription and consumer healthcare. Given the ongoing sales momentum in elastomer components and active material solutions, AptarGroup is expanding its capacity to produce elastomer components for injected medicines and active material science solutions, which will drive near-term growth.
The company's ongoing business transformation plan is expected to drive top-line growth, boost operational excellence and improve organizational effectiveness. Backed by its efforts to bring innovative products into the market, the company remains the preferred choice for renowned brands worldwide. Focus on acquisitions to expand the scope of technologies, geographic presence and product offerings will also aid growth.

You can see 
.
: The company's packaging business, which accounts for around 91% of its revenues, is poised to gain from strong demand in e-commerce and stable demand for the packaging of meat, fruit and vegetables, processed food, beverages, and medicines. The conversion of the No. 3 paper machine at its Jackson, AL-based mill to linerboard in a phased manner over the next three years will help it meet the strong packaging demand. The company maintains a balanced approach toward capital allocation to boost growth and maximize returns for shareholders.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Packaging Corp's ongoing year's earnings has been revised upward by 1.1% in the past 90 days. PKG has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 12.3%, on average.

Efforts taken to increase market share in emerging markets, wherein the demand for packaging products is being fueled by urbanization and rising incomes, will be a significant growth driver. Focus on innovative products and sustainable packaging offerings will be key catalysts.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Amcor's ongoing year's earnings has been revised upward by 3% in the past 90 days. Amcor has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 8.1%, on average. The Switzerland-based company has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 2.6%. AMCR currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.
: Strong demand for automated equipment and sustainable packaging solutions will drive Sealed Air's growth.

Notably, Fluids and Liquids is the highest-margin, fastest-growing product line for SEE.
Its protein automation pipeline continues to grow across all regions, with major food producers committing to its SEE Touchless Automation future. With an estimated addressable market of $15 billion for Automated Protective Solutions, the company has immense potential to grow this business.
Sealed Air recently initiated a three-year CTO2Grow Program, designed to drive annualized savings of around $140-$160 million by the end of 2025. Per the program, the company seeks to optimize its portfolio with a focus on automation, digital and sustainable solutions, streamline its supply-chain footprint, and drive SG&A productivity.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Sealed Air's 2024 earnings has moved up 1% over the past 90 days. SEE has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 32.2%, on average. The Charlotte, NC-based company carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present.
: Greif continues to make strategic acquisitions to expand its geographic reach and its product portfolio.

This is in sync with Greif's strategic objective to grow its product offerings in high-performance jerry cans and small plastics globally.
The IPACKCHEM acquisition, along with the previous additions of Reliance Products, Colepack and an 80% stake in Centurion Container, will aid GEF's growth. The company's M&A pipeline remains solid.

What Makes Amcor plc (AMCR) One of the Worst Dividend Aristocrat Stocks to Buy Right Now?

We recently compiled a list of the 
. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amcor plc (NYSE:AMCR) stands against the other dividend aristocrat stocks.
Dividend aristocrats are companies that have raised their dividend payouts for at least 25 consecutive years. Achieving and maintaining a dividend streak this long is a tough nut to crack. That is why, among the approximately 6,000 stocks listed on the NYSE and NASDAQ, only around 67 companies have earned the distinction of being called dividend aristocrats. This strong dividend growth track records imply that these companies were financially stable enough to sustain their payouts during two significant financial crises: the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic. Besides this, these companies have also shown strong performance relative to the broader market over the years. The Dividend Aristocrat Index has outperformed the wider market with lower volatility since its inception in 2005. Recently we covered the list of the 
 according to Wall Street analysts.
Analysts have closely observed the performance of dividend aristocrats in the past and in recent times. In a January 2019 blog post titled ‘Dividend Growth Strategies and Downside Protection’, Phillip Brzenk, global head of multi-asset indexes, analyzed how dividend growth strategies perform, particularly in times when the market experiences declines. He said that since the end of 1989, there have been six calendar years when the broader market posted negative performance. Interestingly, in each of these years, the Dividend Aristocrats outperformed the broader equity benchmark by an average of 13.28%. Moreover, they managed to achieve a positive total return in three of those challenging years. He further said, the aristocrats outperformed the market in 53% of instances, with an average outperformance of 0.16%, when their performance was observed on a monthly basis.
As mentioned above, dividend growth stocks have 
 than the overall market. Since its inception in 2005 up until September 2023, the dividend aristocrats index achieved a total return of 10.35%, surpassing the broader market's return of 9.54% during the same timeframe. Additionally, the dividend aristocrats exhibited lower volatility, at 15.35%, compared to the market’s 16.31%. This indicates that the prices of these stocks are more stable and less prone to frequent changes, demonstrating their relative resilience.
That said, analysts are now turning their attention to different aspects of dividend investing. For taxable investors, dividends can be less favorable compared to share repurchases. Additionally, focusing on dividends limits diversification since around 60% of U.S. stocks and 40% of international stocks do not pay dividends. As a result, portfolios that emphasize dividends are significantly less diversified than those that do not consider dividends in their design. Less-diversified portfolios tend to be less efficient due to a higher potential range of returns without any corresponding increase in expected returns, assuming the exposure to common factors remains constant. Moreover, emphasizing dividends often leads to an overinvestment in U.S. equities, causing a home-country bias and further reducing diversification.
According to this analysis, dividends are a tax-efficient method for returning capital to shareholders. However, investors continue to favor these equities due to their solid performance and the reliable income they offer. Although dividend aristocrats are strong companies with consistent dividend growth, some are less favored by analysts due to factors like industry challenges, macroeconomic conditions, and specific business issues.
For our list, we scanned a list of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, companies that have raised their dividends for 25 consecutive years or more. We then ranked these stocks according to their average analyst ratings from Yahoo Finance, where a higher score signifies the worst rating. The "Recommendation Rating" is a way to assess stocks. It uses a scale from 1 to 5, with each number indicating a different recommendation:
1. Strong Buy
2. Buy
3. Hold
4. Underperform
5. Sell
From this ranking, we selected the stocks with scores of 3 or more.

AMCR tops our list of the worst dividend aristocrat stocks.
Amcor plc (NYSE:AMCR) reported strong earnings in fiscal Q3 2024. However, it reported revenue of $3.41 billion, which declined by 7% from the same period last year.

In its earnings report, the company mentioned that the price mix negatively affected sales by about 3%. This was due to larger-than-expected volume declines in high-margin healthcare categories, which the company had already anticipated and mentioned in the previous quarter. In terms of dividends, the company has a high payout ratio of over 72%, which is concerning for income investors.

When Should You Buy Amcor plc (NYSE:AMCR)?

Let's talk about the popular Amcor plc (
). The company's shares saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. The recent share price gains has brought the company back closer to its yearly peak. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today we will analyse the most recent data on Amcor’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.
The share price seems sensible at the moment according to our price multiple model, where we compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. We’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 22.15x is currently trading slightly above its industry peers’ ratio of 22.07x, which means if you buy Amcor today, you’d be paying a relatively sensible price for it. And if you believe Amcor should be trading in this range, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond the levels of other industry peers over the long-term. Furthermore, Amcor’s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. This may mean it is less likely for the stock to fall lower from natural market volatility, which suggests less opportunities to buy moving forward.
Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 49% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Amcor. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.
 AMCR’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at AMCR? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuate below the industry PE ratio?
 If you’ve been keeping an eye on AMCR, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for AMCR, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.
With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. For example, we've found that Amcor has

7 Dividend Aristocrats That Will Have Investors in High-Yield Heaven

Just 1% of all stocks listed on the major U.S. exchanges are Dividend Aristocrats. These are the 67 companies listed on the 
 that have raised their dividends for 25 consecutive years or more. It is an elite group of stocks recognized for their quality and consistency over time.
That doesn’t mean their shares won’t fall. In fact, many of the high-yield Dividend Aristocrats below are down in 2024 or have 
. What separates them from other similarly situated stocks, though, is their resiliency. More often than not, they tend to bounce back stronger than they were.
Of course, what attracts investors to this list of dividend royalty is their dividend.  These reliable income streams juice a portfolio’s total return helping the stocks to outperform non-payers over time. Analysts at 
 found that S&P stocks that initiated and raised their dividends handily beat any other class of stock.
Yet just like with share prices, being a Dividend Aristocrat stock doesn’t mean they 
. The most recent example is 
 (NYSE:
), which slashed its payout in half in May and was booted off of the list. Still, like physics, an object in motion tends to stay in motion and Dividend Aristocrats tend to keep paying and raising their payouts over time.
The royalty below sport yields nearly three times that of the S&P 500 and represent some of the best companies to buy now.

Real estate investment trust (
) 
 (NYSE:
) doesn’t have the longest track record of raising its payout amongst Dividend Aristocrats but it arguably has one of the most impressive. A monthly dividend REIT, it has made 648 consecutive monthly payments while raising the payout for 29 straight years since going public in 1994.
Unlike office REITs, which have been especially depressed since the pandemic made the work-from-home phenomenon more widespread, Realty Income specializes in 
 that typically feature a single store. Among its biggest tenants are dollar store chains 
 (NYSE:
) and 
 (NASDAQ:
), pharmacy chain 
 (NASDAQ:
), and convenience store chain
.
It should be pointed out that Walgreens just announced it would be closing many money-losing locations. The pharmacy didn’t specify how many, and it is unknown how much of that real estate Realty Income owns, but the pharmacy chain only represents 
. It means the REIT’s diversification prevents any significant impact.
Realty Income’s dividend yields 5.9% annually. As it generates a significant amount of adjusted funds from operations (
), a metric similar to free cash flow (
) for REITs, its dividend is secure.

Investors have been waiting for a turnaround to happen for the world’s largest food and beverage packaging expert 
 (NYSE:
). Like office REITs and many other stocks, Amcor was 
 of inflation and high interest rates. Its stock has been essentially flat over the past year and until only recently was heavily in the red.
Over the past month, however, AMCR stock jumped 10% after reporting fiscal third-quarter earnings. Although the packaging company missed analysts sales estimates, profits of 17.8 cents per share 
.
As the biggest player with more than twice the market share of its nearest competitor, Amcor can benefit from economies of scale on input costs, primarily resins, than its competitors. Moreover, it signs long-term contracts (about seven years) when its plants are located near customers as it reduces transportation costs. The average contract is typically for two to three years. It is also investing more in higher margin segments such as pet food and medical products. As Amcor’s lower value contracts expire, it can raise prices or trade up to higher value ones.
Growth won’t ever be explosive, even in the emerging markets it services, but it will be steady, providing a foundation for its dividend that yields 5.1% annually.

Pharmaceutical giant 
 (NYSE:
) got a backdoor entrance into the Dividend Aristocrat list. After being spun off from parent 
 (NYSE:
) in 2013 it inherited its former parent’s dividend payment history. Yet over the past decade, AbbVie has steadily raised its dividend by a compounded annual growth rate (
) of 14%. FCF has grown at a similar rate, ensuring the continued payout of the dividend, which yields 3.7% a year.
There was a lot of concern about its primary therapy Humira losing patent protection and having to face biosimilar competition. However, the drug continues to 
 in revenue and it has a full portfolio of other billion-dollar therapies. It turns out there was a lot of concern over nothing. Shares of the pharmaceutical are up 9% year-to-date and 27% over the past year.
In addition to its own portfolio of drugs, AbbVie has been on a spending spree, buying up other promising drugs. It just acquired 
 for $250 million for its CEL383 to treat inflammatory bowel disease. It has successfully completed Phase 1 trials though results haven’t been published. This year it also acquired

Consumer products leader 
 (NYSE:
) is on a roll this year with shares up 15% in 2024 as it rebounds from inflation-impacted results. Yet because it owns a portfolio of billion-dollar name brands itself, including Kleenex, Huggies and Scott that hold the 
 in some 80 countries, it was able to mitigate the damage.
The value of owning such well-known brands is consumers understand the quality and consistency of the products they are buying. And since the merchandise is a consumable, shoppers return to the store again and again to buy more.
High inflation does cause consumers to trade down to lower-priced products. When it eases, though, they will often return to their previous habits. There is more good news for Kimberly-Clark on the inflation front too. The Commerce Dept. just reported 
 from the previous month. Inflation was still up 2.6% from the year-ago period.
With prices moving in the right direction, the Federal Reserve may be more inclined to cut interest rates than the bank presidents previously expressed.
Even so, KMB’s dividend is not in any danger. Although it has 
 over the past decade at just 3.8%, the dividend payout ratio of 57% still means the dividend is safe.

 (NYSE:
) is one of the newest additions to the Divident Aristocrat list. It was spun off by 
 (NYSE:
) last year as the pharmaceutical giant wanted to focus more acutely on healthcare. Kenvue is the world’s largest pure-play consumer health company by revenue. It owns some of the best 
 like Tylenol, Band-Aid, Listerine and Johnson’s.
Like AbbVie, it is considered dividend royalty by virtue of its former parent’s dividend history. Its payout of 80 cents per share yields 4.3% annually. And despite not having a track record yet of its own to run on, CEO Thibaut Mongon has 
 is “an important component of our disciplined capital allocation strategy and our plan to deliver sustained value creation for all of our stockholders.”
That should provide sufficient comfort to investors that Kenvue intends to continue the dividend practices established under Johnson & Johnson.
Source: Coca-Cola
 (NYSE:
) is the beverage king for good reason. The “wave” logo is an iconic symbol of the company around the world. Soda continues to generate billions of dollars in revenue for Coke despite the secular decline in consumption.
Precisely because of changing consumer tastes, Coca-Cola has undergone a transformation. It is no longer just a carbonated beverages business but also possesses some of the best still beverage brands. From Dasani water and protein-enhance Fairlife milk to Gold Peak tea and Minute Maid juice, Coke 
 in the beverage aisle.
That is supported by an unparalleled distribution network. Any new product offering can command premium shelf space in grocery and convenience stores.
Coca-Cola has a 57-year history of raising its dividend,which yields 3% annually. The beverage stock has grown the payout at 4.8% CAGR for the past decade. It also 
 earlier this year of 5.4%.

The second-largest integrated oil and gas giant 
 (NYSE:
) is the seventh Dividend Aristocrat that should put investors in dividend heaven. The company is just one of a handful of oil and gas stocks that didn’t suspend or cut its dividend during the pandemic. Despite oil trading at -$37 a barrel at one point, meaning no one wanted to take or hold oil with the economy locked down, it relied upon its immense profit-generating capabilities to see it through the turmoil.
Fortunately, Chevron 
 while supporting its dividend even if the price of a barrel of Brent crude falls to $50. Brent oil is the international benchmark and it currently trades north of $87 a barrel. Chevron says it can more than double its FCF by 2027. As it has grown its cash profits by 6% annually for the past five years it is probable it can do so as the oil giant invests in its business, makes acquisitions and reduces its operating costs.
Chevron’s dividend of $6.52 per share is yielding 4.1% at current prices.

Amcor and Lorenz Snacks partner for more sustainable snack packaging

Amcor, a global leader in responsible packaging solutions, has joined forces with snack manufacturer Lorenz Snacks to introduce a new, recycle-ready package for its Lentil Coated Peanuts product.
The collaboration marks a significant step forward in the snack industry’s pursuit of sustainable packaging.
Lorenz, a fourth-generation family business with a global reach, has been actively working to improve its packaging sustainability.
The company said it is committed to improving sustainability and has already achieved a “good” rating for recyclability across 92% of its primary packaging from third-party cyclos-HTP. With an aim to convert the remaining percentages to highly recyclable by the end of 2025.
The new Lentil Coated Peanuts pack utilises Amcor’s AmPrima portfolio, a range of monomaterial, recyclable packaging options designed to deliver sustainability without compromising performance.
The AmPrima solution has resulted in a 51% reduction in carbon footprint, water consumption, and a 41% reduction in non-renewable energy use compared to traditional packaging for the product.
Additionally, the packs align with CEFLEX design guidelines for a circular economy.
Traditional nut packaging often relies on multimaterial composites to protect the product and extend its shelf life. However, these materials are typically non-recyclable.
Amcor’s AmPrima offers a groundbreaking alternative, providing the necessary barrier protection, durability, and visual appeal while being recycle-ready.
“The Amcor AmPrima solution solves one of the biggest problems in snack packaging. It preserves barrier protection, physical durability
 and visual appeal while enabling consumers to easily recycle packs - something that was typically not possible before,” said Piotr Nagalski, sales and marketing director for Snacks & Confectionery at Amcor.
Consumer research consistently demonstrates a strong preference for sustainable packaging that also looks appealing on shelves.
Amcor’s solution allows Lorenz to maintain a visually attractive pack with the protective qualities consumers expect.
“The successful implementation of Amcor’s AmPrima packaging for Lorenz Lentil Coated Peanuts is a testament to the feasibility of more sustainable packaging in the snack industry,” added Nagalski.
“Amcor’s innovative expertise, coupled with Lorenz’s deep understanding of the snack market, has pushed the boundaries of what is possible.”

Amcor plc (NYSE:AMCR) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 61%

To get a sense of who is truly in control of Amcor plc (
), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 61% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.
Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Amcor.
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
We can see that Amcor does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Amcor's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Amcor. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 7.4%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.4% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.5% by the third-largest shareholder.
Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.
The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
Our information suggests that Amcor plc insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$47m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to 
The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 39% stake in Amcor. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 
 (of which 1 shouldn't be ignored!) you should know about.
But ultimately 
, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at

Amcor plc (AMCR): Top Dividend Aristocrat Stock Right Now?

We recently compiled a list of the 
. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amcor plc (NYSE:AMCR) stands against the other dividend aristocrats.
Investors have always put income at the top of their list. And when it comes to raking in money, you can’t beat dividend stocks. Research by S&P Dow Jones Indices has demonstrated that over the long haul, dividend-paying companies have outperformed non-dividend companies and the broader market on a risk-adjusted basis. Though investing in high dividend yields is not advised by analysts, recent research indicates that dividend yield is a risk factor that pays off, historically earnings higher returns than a market-cap-weighted benchmark. When paired with other factors like volatility, quality, momentum, size, and value, dividend yield strategies can potentially tap into systematic sources of returns.
Dividend yield and dividend growth have always been a hot topic among investors. But little did they realize that dividend yield is a key piece of the puzzle when it comes to dividend growth. When it comes to the Dividend Aristocrats Index, the knack for increasing dividends for 25 straight years doesn’t mean sacrificing yield. The index has consistently outshone its benchmark by delivering higher yields, typically between 2% and 2.9% over the past 26 years ending 2023. On average, the index’s yield was 2.5%, compared to the market’s 1.8%. To read more about high dividend stocks, have a look at 
.
In addition to offering solid yields, dividend aristocrats are also less volatile than other asset classes. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, the Dividend Aristocrats Index has outpaced the broader market over the long haul with less volatility, which is indicated by its higher risk-adjusted returns. The index’s ability to provide downside protection is evident in its upside and downside capture ratio. These stocks have outperformed the market in 69.34% of down months and 43.61% of up months. Moreover, the Dividend Aristocrats Index has experienced lower drawdowns compared to the benchmark index. The report further mentioned that the index delivered an average excess return of 1.05% during down months compared to the broad-based benchmark.
Data from 2023 highlights how eager companies are to boost their dividends. This isn't just a knee-jerk move to lure investors; it's backed by robust corporate balance sheets, with companies raking in more cash flows than ever before. According to Janus Henderson, corporate cash flow remained strong in 2023 across most sectors, giving companies ample resources for dividends and share buybacks. As a result, global dividend growth saw a 5% increase for the year, aligning with the long-term trend. The firm also gave a positive outlook for dividends in 2024. It said that dividends appear solidly supported this year, although one-time special dividends are expected to decrease from the record levels observed over the past three years. The firm’s forecast predicts $1.72 trillion in dividends for 2024, marking a 3.9% increase on a headline basis, which translates to a 5% growth rate on a headline basis.
There are many dividend aristocrats that offer solid yields to shareholders. In this article, we will take a look at some of the best dividend aristocrat stocks with high yields.
For this list, we looked at a group of 67 dividend aristocrat companies, which are known for raising dividends for 25 years or more. From this list, we chose 10 stocks with the highest dividend yields as of June 25 and arranged them in order from lowest to highest yield. We also measured hedge fund sentiment around each stock according to Insider Monkey’s database of 920 funds as of Q1 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (

3 Sustainable Packaging Stocks Wrapping Up Profits

Sustainable packaging stocks are an attractive investment because the industry is growing and advancing at a fast pace.
Sustainable packaging stocks include companies that design and 
 packaging solutions that are eco-friendly. These companies are involved in the development of packaging solutions. These solutions are either made to be recycled or biodegradable, or even reusable through the use of modern technology.
Technological developments are therefore being used in the sustainable packaging sector in a big way. Technologically advanced concepts like AI in packaging, bio-based 
 materials, and tech-based packaging like QR codes and NFC are also becoming more popular. These technologies increase consumer participation. This is because they are able to get information on the product’s source and sustainability. Also, they increase the effectiveness and tracking of the packaging.
Sustainable packaging stocks could then point to where society is headed toward in the future. Here are three companies that I feel are worth adding to your portfolio.

 (NYSE:
) is a leading supplier of sustainable aluminum packaging solutions.
The company has more than 50 production facilities across the globe. It also supplies the leading brands such as 
 (NYSE:
) 
 with products under long-term agreements.
Apart from its primary aluminum can business, Ball believes that there is much room for the 
. This will be through the application of aluminum packaging to other categories of beverages. These include sparkling water and beer products since plastic bottles and glass containers are still popular. It is also important to note that the company has embraced sustainability, especially in its manufacturing processes. This has enabled it to meet the current consumer trends on eco-friendly packaging.
I think that BALL could be one of those sustainable packaging stocks for investors. Analysts are eying 
 EPS increases for BALL stock for the foreseeable future.

 (NYSE:
) is a global leader in responsible packaging solutions. The company’s activities are grouped into two business segments; Flexibles Segment which forms 76% of its consolidated revenues and the Rigid Packaging Segment. Amcor’s production is diverse and its products are used in the beverage, personal care, and home products industries.
Organizations are embracing sustainability and Amcor is not an exception because the company is investing in 
 of its manufacturing processes to meet the needs of the consumers who are increasingly demanding eco-friendly packaging. The firm’s operations are spread across the world with the company’s facilities located in 41 countries. However, the company earns its main revenue from North America and Western Europe.
I like AMCR as one of those sustainable packaging stocks for a few reasons, but the most compelling one is 
. It trades at just 14x earnings and only 1.08x times sales. These ratios are significantly below the broader market.

 (NYSE:
) looks like an interesting company in the consumer packaging space for a value investor like me. The company is one of the largest producers of fiber-based packaging material and solutions with a focus on paperboard, food, and beverage packaging through its three divisions; Paperboard Mills, Americas Packaging, and Europe Packaging.
Graphic Packaging has also adopted a sound approach to expansion, 
 to gain a wider spread of end markets and geographical presence, especially in Europe. Although the company is suffering from some short-term issues such as volumes and cost pressures, as revealed in its Q1 
, the capital spending on the production facilities will certainly help it to enhance the operating profit and cash flows in the long term.
GPK is one of those sustainable packaging stocks that’s 
 relative to its expected growth rates for its top and bottom lines, trading at just 0.9x sales.

BERY vs. AMCR: Which Stock Is the Better Value Option?

Investors looking for stocks in the Containers - Paper and Packaging sector might want to consider either Berry Global (BERY) or Amcor (AMCR). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.
Both Berry Global and Amcor have a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.
BERY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 8.74, while AMCR has a forward P/E of 14.08. We also note that BERY has a PEG ratio of 1.31. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. AMCR currently has a PEG ratio of 4.60.
Another notable valuation metric for BERY is its P/B ratio of 2.29. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, AMCR has a P/B of 3.76.
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to BERY's Value grade of A and AMCR's Value grade of C.
Both BERY and AMCR are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that BERY is the superior value option right now.

An Intrinsic Calculation For Amcor plc (NYSE:AMCR) Suggests It's 41% Undervalued

Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Amcor plc (
) as an investment opportunity by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!
We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the 
.
We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:
 = US$8.5b
We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.4%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.9%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.4b× (1 + 2.4%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.4%) = US$32b
= TV / (1 + r)
= US$32b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)
= US$16b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$25b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$10.1, the company appears quite good value at a 41% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.
We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Amcor as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.979. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Amcor, we've put together three pertinent elements you should look at:
