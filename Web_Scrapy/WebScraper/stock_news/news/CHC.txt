Charter Hall Group (ASX:CHC) shareholders have earned a 9.7% CAGR over the last five years

 (
) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 14% in the last quarter. But at least the stock is up over the last five years. Unfortunately its return of 35% is below the market return of 39%. Unfortunately not all shareholders will have held it for the long term, so spare a thought for those caught in the 25% decline over the last twelve months.
Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns.
While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).
During five years of share price growth, Charter Hall Group actually saw its EPS drop 5.0% per year.
By glancing at these numbers, we'd posit that the decline in earnings per share is not representative of how the business has changed over the years. Therefore, it's worth taking a look at other metrics to try to understand the share price movements.
We note that the dividend is higher than it was previously - always nice to see. It could be that the company is reaching maturity and dividend investors are buying for the yield. We'd posit that the revenue growth over the last five years, of 23% per year, would encourage people to invest.
You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).
We consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. This 
 
 should help you form a view on Charter Hall Group
When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between 
 (TSR) and 
. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Charter Hall Group, it has a TSR of 59% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the 
 shareholder return.
Charter Hall Group shareholders are down 22% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 4.7%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 10%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Charter Hall Group better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - Charter Hall Group has

Positive week for Charter Hall Group (ASX:CHC) institutional investors who lost 11% over the past year

Every investor in Charter Hall Group (
) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 52% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).
Last week's AU$180m market cap gain would probably be appreciated by institutional investors, especially after a year of 11% losses.
Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Charter Hall Group.
Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.
As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Charter Hall Group. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Charter Hall Group's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.
Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Charter Hall Group. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 10% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.1% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.9% by the third-largest shareholder.
A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.
Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.
Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.
Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in Charter Hall Group. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth AU$62m. Most would see this as a real positive. If you would like to explore the question of insider alignment, you can 
The general public-- including retail investors -- own 46% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Be aware that

Is Charter Hall Group's (ASX:CHC) Recent Stock Performance Influenced By Its Fundamentals In Any Way?

Charter Hall Group's (ASX:CHC) stock is up by a considerable 18% over the past month. We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to 
 ROE today.
Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.
The 
 is:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Charter Hall Group is:
6.0% = AU$196m ÷ AU$3.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).
The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every A$1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated A$0.06 in profit.
Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or "retain", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.
At first glance, Charter Hall Group's ROE doesn't look very promising. However, given that the company's ROE is similar to the average industry ROE of 6.7%, we may spare it some thought. Even so, Charter Hall Group has shown a fairly decent growth in its net income which grew at a rate of 19%. Considering the moderately low ROE, it is quite possible that there might be some other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.
As a next step, we compared Charter Hall Group's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 12%.
Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to 
, relative to its industry.
Charter Hall Group has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 42% (or a retention ratio of 58%) and a respectable amount of growth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making efficient use of its profits.
Moreover, Charter Hall Group is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to rise to 56% over the next three years. However, Charter Hall Group's future ROE is expected to rise to 12% despite the expected increase in the company's payout ratio. We infer that there could be other factors that could be driving the anticipated growth in the company's ROE.
On the whole, we do feel that Charter Hall Group has some positive attributes. With a high rate of reinvestment, albeit at a low ROE, the company has managed to see a considerable growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

Bullish Charter Hall Group Insiders Loaded Up On AU$843.8k Of Stock

When a single insider purchases stock, it is typically not a major deal. However, when multiple insiders purchase stock, like in 
 (
) instance, it's good news for shareholders.
While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.
In the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when MD, Group CEO & Director David Harrison bought AU$550k worth of shares at a price of AU$11.00 per share. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of AU$8.73. Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. We always take careful note of the price insiders pay when purchasing shares. It is generally more encouraging if they paid above the current price, as it suggests they saw value, even at higher levels.
In the last twelve months Charter Hall Group insiders were buying shares, but not selling. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!
There are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. So if that suits your style you could check each stock one by one or you could take a look at this 
 
Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Charter Hall Group insiders own about AU$32m worth of shares. That equates to 0.8% of the company. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.
There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. But insiders have shown more of an appetite for the stock, over the last year. Overall we don't see anything to make us think Charter Hall Group insiders are doubting the company, and they do own shares. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. At Simply Wall St, we found 
 that deserve your attention before buying any shares.

Charter Hall Group (ASX:CHC) shareholders notch a 9.4% CAGR over 5 years, yet earnings have been shrinking

Stock pickers are generally looking for stocks that will outperform the broader market. Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, long term 
 (
) shareholders have enjoyed a 34% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 24% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 12% , including dividends .
Since it's been a strong week for Charter Hall Group shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals.
There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.
Charter Hall Group's earnings per share are down 25% per year, despite strong share price performance over five years.
This means it's unlikely the market is judging the company based on earnings growth. Because earnings per share don't seem to match up with the share price, we'll take a look at other metrics instead.
On the other hand, Charter Hall Group's revenue is growing nicely, at a compound rate of 13% over the last five years. It's quite possible that management are prioritizing revenue growth over EPS growth at the moment.
The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).
We consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. If you are thinking of buying or selling Charter Hall Group stock, you should check out this 
 
.
When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between 
 (TSR) and 
. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Charter Hall Group's TSR for the last 5 years was 57%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!
Charter Hall Group shareholders gained a total return of 12% during the year. But that was short of the market average. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it's actually better than the average return of 9% over half a decade This suggests the company might be improving over time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Charter Hall Group better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered

Charter Hall Group (ASX:CHC) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 52% of the company

If you want to know who really controls Charter Hall Group (
), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 52% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).
Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Charter Hall Group.
Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.
Charter Hall Group already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Charter Hall Group's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Charter Hall Group. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 10% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.2% and 5.6% of the stock.
On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.
Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.
Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.
Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Charter Hall Group. Keep in mind that it's a big company, and the insiders own AU$42m worth of shares. The absolute value might be more important than the proportional share. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking 
The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 47% stake in Charter Hall Group. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.
I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered 
 that you should be aware of before investing here.
If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check

Australian Dividend Stocks Delivering Up To 6.9% Yields

As the Australian market exhibits a cautious equilibrium, with gains in the mining sector balancing out losses among financial heavyweights, investors are closely monitoring the Reserve Bank of Australia's upcoming policy decisions. Amidst this backdrop, dividend stocks continue to attract attention for their potential to offer investors steady income streams, particularly those delivering yields up to 6.9% in sectors less sensitive to interest rate fluctuations.
Let's take a closer look at a couple of our picks from the screened companies.
 ★★★★★☆
 Charter Hall Group is a prominent Australian property investment and funds management company with a market capitalization of approximately A$6.24 billion.
 Charter Hall Group generates revenue primarily through its funds management and property investments segments, with A$515.60 million and A$142.20 million respectively.
 3.3%
Charter Hall Group's dividend yield stands at A$3.35%, underperforming the top quartile of Australian dividend stocks. Despite a decade of stable and growing payouts, supported by a payout ratio of 43.8% and cash payout ratio of 45.3%, recent financials show a dip in net income from A$179.3 million to A$48.9 million year-on-year, alongside reduced sales revenue, signaling potential headwinds for future dividend growth despite current earnings and cash flow coverage. Trading at a significant discount to estimated fair value suggests valuation appeal amidst challenges.
 ★★★★☆☆
 Accent Group Limited is a retailer and distributor specializing in lifestyle footwear, apparel, and accessories across Australia and New Zealand, with a market capitalization of approximately A$1.14 billion.
 Accent Group Limited's revenue is primarily derived from its multi-channel retail operations in performance and lifestyle footwear, totaling A$1.40 billion.
 6.9%
Accent Group's recent dividend of A$0.085, despite a high yield of 6.93%, is shadowed by a payout ratio exceeding earnings at 107.2%, indicating potential sustainability issues. The company's dividends have shown volatility over the past decade, lacking reliability and stability. However, the stock trades at a substantial discount to fair value and is supported by cash flows with a cash payout ratio at 39%. Half-yearly sales dipped to A$732.9 million from A$746.49 million, with net income falling to A$42.24 million from A$58.33 million year-on-year; yet earnings are expected to grow by 11.9% annually, suggesting possible future improvement in dividend coverage.
 ★★★★☆☆
 Southern Cross Electrical Engineering Limited is an Australian company specializing in electrical, instrumentation, communication, and maintenance services with a market capitalization of approximately A$247.33 million.
 Southern Cross Electrical Engineering Limited generates its revenue primarily through the provision of electrical services, amounting to A$464.88 million.
 5.3%
Southern Cross Electrical Engineering's dividends, while covered by earnings and cash flows with payout ratios of 66.5% and 78.1% respectively, have been inconsistent over the past decade, reflecting a lack of reliability for investors seeking stable income. The stock is currently undervalued at 18.6% below fair value and has experienced earnings growth of 13.3% annually over five years. However, its dividend yield at 5.32% trails the Australian market's top dividend payers. Recent inclusion in the S&P/ASX indices could signal enhanced visibility but half-year sales remained flat with a slight dip in net income year-on-year.

Bullish Charter Hall Group Insiders Loaded Up On AU$782.0k Of Stock

Usually, when one insider buys stock, it might not be a monumental event. But when multiple insiders are buying like they did in the case of 
 (
), that sends out a positive message to the company's shareholders.
While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.
The MD, Group CEO & Director David Harrison made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for AU$550k worth of shares at a price of AU$11.00 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, at around the current price, which is AU$11.76. Of course they may have changed their mind. But this suggests they are optimistic. If someone buys shares at well below current prices, it's a good sign on balance, but keep in mind they may no longer see value. The good news for Charter Hall Group share holders is that insiders were buying at near the current price.
While Charter Hall Group insiders bought shares during the last year, they didn't sell. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!

This makes one think the business has some good points.
Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Insiders own 0.8% of Charter Hall Group shares, worth about AU$46m.

Given that insiders also own a fair bit of Charter Hall Group we think they are probably pretty confident of a bright future. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Charter Hall Group. In terms of investment risks,
