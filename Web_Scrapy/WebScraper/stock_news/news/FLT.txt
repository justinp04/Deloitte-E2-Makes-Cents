ASX Growth Companies With High Insider Ownership And A Minimum 22% Return On Equity


================================================================================

Top 3 ASX Stocks Estimated To Be Below Intrinsic Value In July 2024

Amidst a turbulent week where the ASX200 shed gains to close lower, investors face a challenging landscape marked by sector-wide declines and volatile commodity prices. In such an environment, identifying stocks that appear undervalued relative to their intrinsic value could offer potential opportunities for discerning investors looking to navigate these uncertain market conditions.
Let's review some notable picks from our screened stocks.
 Flight Centre Travel Group Limited operates as a travel retailer serving both leisure and corporate sectors across various regions including Australia, New Zealand, the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia with a market capitalization of approximately A$4.98 billion.
 The company generates revenue primarily through two segments: the leisure sector, which brought in A$1.28 billion, and the corporate sector, with A$1.06 billion in earnings.
 26.6%
Flight Centre Travel Group, trading at A$22.66, is positioned below the estimated fair value of A$30.88, indicating a significant undervaluation based on discounted cash flows. Recently profitable, FLT's earnings are expected to grow by 19.1% annually, outpacing the Australian market forecast of 13.5%. While its revenue growth at 9.7% per year also exceeds the national average of 5.6%, it does not reach the high-growth benchmark of over 20%.
 James Hardie Industries plc specializes in manufacturing and selling fiber cement, fiber gypsum, and cement bonded building products for various building construction applications, primarily serving markets in the United States, Australia, Europe, New Zealand, and the Philippines with a market capitalization of A$23.18 billion.
 The company's revenue is generated from three key segments: Europe Building Products at $482.10 million, Asia Pacific Fiber Cement at $562.80 million, and North America Fiber Cement at $2.89 billion.
 22%
James Hardie Industries, priced at A$53.73, shows potential underpricing with a fair value estimate of A$68.87. Its earnings and revenue are set to outperform the Australian market with forecasts of 14% and 8% growth respectively. However, its growth rates don't exceed the high threshold of 20%. Despite this moderate growth forecast, it remains attractive due to a trading price that's 22% below estimated fair value and recent strategic moves like expanding its buyback plan by A$50 million and inclusion in the S&P/ASX 20 Index.
 Webjet Limited operates as an online travel booking service across Australia, New Zealand, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and other international markets with a market capitalization of approximately A$3.51 billion.
 The company generates revenue through its Business to Business Travel (B2B) and Business to Consumer Travel (B2C) segments, totaling A$327.90 million and A$142.80 million respectively.
 13.1%
Webjet Limited, currently priced at A$8.97, is trading below the estimated fair value of A$10.32. With a revenue growth forecast of 10.6% per year and earnings expected to increase by 20.26% annually, it outpaces the Australian market's average growth rates in both metrics. Despite these positive indicators and a significant past earnings growth of 401.4%, Webjet's Return on Equity is projected to remain low at 15.9% in three years, suggesting potential concerns about future profitability efficiency amidst ongoing corporate restructuring, including a planned demerger aimed at enhancing operational focus and market positioning.
