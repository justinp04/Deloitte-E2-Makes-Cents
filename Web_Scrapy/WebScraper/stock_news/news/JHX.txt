James Hardie Industries Announces Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Results

--(
)--
, today announced results for its third quarter ending 31 December 2023.
Speaking to the results, James Hardie CEO Aaron Erter said, "Our team’s focus remains simple: working safely, partnering with our customers, investing in long-term growth and driving profitable share gain. This focus has enabled us to deliver a strong nine months, and a record quarterly result for Adjusted Net Income."
Mr. Erter continued, "Our last four quarterly results have demonstrated that we are accelerating through this cycle and taking share. We have a superior value proposition that helps our customers grow and be successful. Our team is focused on maintaining this momentum and consistency to deliver strong financial results again in the fourth quarter. We are homeowner focused, customer and contractor driven, providing the entire value chain with world-class products and services."
Net Sales increased 13% to US$727.0 million. Average Net Sales Price (ASP) growth of +3% was supported by a 9% increase in volumes. Volume of 767 million standard feet exceeded the top end of November guidance of 730 million to 760 million standard feet. EBIT increased 37% to a record US$237.8 million, supported by a higher average net sales price and lower freight and pulp costs. SG&A investments increased 40% or US$21.5 million. This increase is primarily attributable to Homeowner and Trade marketing initiatives combined with significantly reduced levels of activity in the same period of the prior year. Sequentially, SG&A investment was up 1% versus the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. EBIT margin improved 570 basis points to a record 32.7%.
Net Sales increased 21% to A$206.3 million supported by ASP growth of +14% and a 6% increase in volumes, with New Zealand volumes performing the strongest. EBIT increased 34% to A$56.7 million, supported by a higher average net sales price, partially offset by higher cost of goods sold per unit due to product mix. EBIT margin improved 280 basis points to 27.5%.
Net Sales increased 8% primarily related to a 18% increase in ASP and a €4.2 million favorable true-up related to customer rebate estimates. The growth in ASP resulted from our strategic price increases and growth in High Value Products. Volumes declined 10%, driven by reduced market activity in Fiber Gypsum. EBIT of €7.1 million increased 373%, supported by a higher ASP, which offset increases in cost of goods sold per unit, as well as increased investment in SG&A to drive growth initiatives. EBIT margin improved 500 basis points to 6.5%.
Operating cash flow increased 73% to a record US$749.5 million for the nine-month period of fiscal year 2024. Nine-month operating cash flow was driven by strong results in all three regions and significant improvement in working capital of US$121.2 million.
James Hardie Chief Financial Officer, Rachel Wilson, stated, "Our Q3 leverage ratio of 0.65x and over US$1 billion of liquidity reflects our strong margins and cash generation. During Q3, we improved our liquidity position by US$419 million, this included proceeds from the US$300 million term loan that was executed in October 2023 and the impact of buying back 2.4 million shares at an average price of US$32.11, for total consideration of approximately US$75 million. We plan to continue to repurchase shares under our US$250 million buyback program.
Our capital allocation framework is unchanged. The primary focus of our capital allocation framework is to invest in organic growth."
Commenting on capital resources, Ms. Wilson stated "Our capacity expansion program is guided by our expectation for sustainable long-term profitable share gain. For the nine-month period of FY24, total capital expenditures were US$328.2 million. We remain committed to appropriately investing in capacity expansion such that we remain flexible and agile to respond as demand increases coming out of this cycle."
Speaking on ESG, Mr. Erter said, "Today, we have highlighted in our presentation materials the benefits of our localized manufacturing footprint in North America. The strategic placement of our network of plants not only optimizes the movement of our products, but also lowers our costs and our carbon footprint. It enables us to be more responsive to regional shifts in demand, while simultaneously allowing us to offer a high degree of customer choices. Sustainability is a never-ending journey for us. We continue to identify and develop solutions that do right by our planet, our people and the communities where we operate. We are all ready to do our part in building a better future for all."

This Media Release includes financial measures that are not considered a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), such as Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Diluted EPS. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered to be more meaningful than the equivalent GAAP measure. Management has included such measures to provide investors with an alternative method for assessing its operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of its ongoing operations and excludes the impact of certain legacy items, such as asbestos adjustments. Additionally, management uses such non-GAAP financial measures for the same purposes. However, these non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may not be reported by all of the Company’s competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of the Company’s competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation. The Company is unable to forecast the comparable US GAAP financial measure for future periods due to, amongst other factors, uncertainty regarding the impact of actuarial estimates on asbestos-related assets and liabilities in future periods. For additional information regarding the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this Media Release, including a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the equivalent GAAP measure, see the section titled "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" included in the Company’s Management’s Analysis of Results for the third quarter ended 31 December 2023.
In addition, this Media Release includes financial measures and descriptions that are considered to not be in accordance with GAAP, but which are consistent with financial measures reported by Australian companies, such as EBIT and EBIT margin. Since the Company prepares its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP, the Company provides investors with definitions and a cross- reference from the non-GAAP financial measure used in this Media Release to the equivalent GAAP financial measure used in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

James Hardie Industries plc (NYSE:
) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript February 12, 2024
James Hardie Industries plc isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (
).
 Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the James Hardie Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Results Briefing. Today's briefing is hosted by James Hardie CEO, Mr. Aaron Erter and CFO, Mrs. Rachel Wilson. After the briefing, we will open the lines to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] After the Q&A, I'll turn it back to Mr. Erter for closing remarks. I would now like to hand the conference over to James Hardie CEO, Mr. Aaron Erter. Please go ahead, sir.
 Thank you, operator. Good morning and good evening to everyone and welcome to our third quarter fiscal year 2024 results briefing. Turning to Page 2, you will see our standard cautionary note on forward-looking statements. Please note that the presentation today does contain forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial information. Also, except where we explicitly state otherwise during our prepared remarks, all references to monetary amounts should be assumed to be in US dollars. Moving to Page 3, you will see our agenda for today. Joining me is our CFO, Rachel Wilson. For today's call, I will start by providing a strategy and operations update. Rachel will then discuss our financial results, and I will return to discuss our outlook, guidance, and provide a brief closing.
We will then open it up for questions. Before I share an update on our strategy and operations, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our employees around the world who remain focused on safely delivering the highest quality products, solutions, and services to our customer partners. Our employees truly represent the very best in our industry and consistently enable our superior value proposition. Let's start on Page 5 with a brief business update. Our team's focus remains simple; working safely, partnering with our customers, investing in long-term growth, and driving profitable share gain. Our third quarter results continue to highlight how impactful that focus has been. For the third quarter, we achieved global net sales of $978.3 million, up 14% versus the prior corresponding period, with a record quarterly global adjusted net income of $179.9 million, up 39% versus the prior corresponding period.
Both our global net sales and adjusted net income results were again supported by volumes in North America that has outperformed the market. Our third quarter North American volume of $766.5 million standard feet exceeded the top end of our guidance range, and we delivered that with a record 32.7% EBIT margin. The adjusted net income result was also supported by strong year-over-year financial results in our Asia-Pacific region. In the EU, business performance improved year-over-year and we are seeing momentum in growing our high-value products. For the first nine months of the year, we generated record operating cash flow of $749.5 million, up 73% year-over-year. Similar to last quarter, we have continued to accelerate our investment in long-term growth, supporting our marketing tent-poles, driving awareness and conversion in targeted regions to aid in sustaining profitable share gain.
Rachel will share additional details in the financial section. While uncertainty continues to affect our end markets, our focus remains on partnering with our customers and controlling what we can control to outperform in the markets we participate. Now please turn to Page 6 in our global strategic framework. As I continue to emphasize, at the heart of our global strategy, we are homeowner-focused, customer and contractor-driven. With that in mind, all three regions remain focused on our three key strategic initiatives. Number one, profitably grow and take share where we have the right to win. Number two, bring our customers high-value differentiated solutions. And number three, connect and influence all the participants in the customer value chain.
I remain confident in our team and our strategy. Combined, they position us to execute at a high level and drive profitable share gains in all three regions. We accelerate our strategic initiatives by establishing competitive advantages through our strategic enablers without compromising on our foundational imperatives. Today, I will discuss two specific components of our value proposition, unrivaled support and localized manufacturing. Let's now turn to Slide 7 to discuss those components in greater detail. At James Hardie, we offer superior products and services to all participants in our value chain. Beyond the high performance of our product offerings, our unrivaled support and localized manufacturing are both key components of the superior value proposition that we offer our customers, builders and contractors.
Unrivaled support is about enhancing the experience for our value chain participants before and after the purchase of our products. Using our North America business, which is led by Sean Gadd, as an example, some of the ways we support value chain participants include; number one, our Customer Integration program. This program enables our customers, in this case, our distribution partners to assess demand, manage stock and inventory positions and ensure that they have the right products at the right place and at the right time. This program also helps our customers and our manufacturing teams plan more efficiently to ensure high levels of service, while optimizing the use of working capital. Number two, Dream Builder events. Some of you will remember this as brand days from our Investor Day in 2022.
At our Dream Builder events, we bring together key customers and contractors with our sales teams to learn more about how to market and sell James Hardie products. These interactive in-person events cover everything from initial home design decisions to the installation of James Hardie products, providing insights and engagement from the beginning to the end of the process. In effect, we are driving the number of contractors pitching James Hardie products in the home. We have doubled the amount of such events held in FY 2024 versus FY 2023. Number three, our Contractor Alliance Program, or CAP, for short, is a membership program for our R&R contractors. The program offers tiered and tailored support and services to meet the varied needs of our contractors regardless of size.
Support includes the sharing of leads or referrals generated through the James Hardie website portal. Supplying our customers with high-quality leads is a key differentiator for James Hardie, high-quality leads benefit both new contractors, just starting out with James Hardie and long-term contractors alike. Contractors value these leads as they are real currency for the success of their businesses. Program members also have access to local sales support, technical training on using our products, and installation support. All of these help our contractors improve the quality and efficiency of installing our products and ultimately assist in lowering the on-the-wall costs for their customers, increasing the overall value they provide homeowners.
And finally, program members have access to co-branded marketing materials like jobs type marketing kits and curated social media packages, which ensure our collective messaging is aligned and impactful. These materials boost the contractor's local presence in the community with the intention of increasing awareness for the contractor, as well as driving James Hardie's presence in their neighborhood. As an example, for every contractor's completed home that utilizes this localized marketing, they can expect to generate on average an incremental 12 leads and an additional two more jobs sold. Our unrivaled support is part of our homeowner-focused, customer and contractor-driven mindset. We are investing in our customers and contractors to help grow their businesses, which will help drive ongoing material conversion towards James Hardie fiber cement.
Localized manufacturing is another part of our superior value proposition for customers, builders, and contractors. We are physically close to our customers. We operate 10 manufacturing sites across the US, enabling a local presence to support our customers' changing needs and differentiating us from our competition. In FY 2023, approximately 70% of our products were delivered within 500 miles of one of our plants. This enables us to provide our customers and partners with reliable and responsive customer support services, limiting exposure to the risk inherent in extended supply chains. Our plants are conveniently located near key sources of raw materials. In FY 2023, approximately 80% of our raw materials were sourced within 150 miles of our plants.
This close proximity provides our plants with efficient sourcing, which helps to minimize freight costs and the carbon footprint of our supply chains. Finally, we invest in and support the communities within which we operate. In FY 2023, we contributed $1.85 billion in incremental growth and economic activity through capital expenditure at our plants, investing in our employees and local ecosystems and across our supplier base. The benefits of our localized manufacturing are long lasting and through our capital allocation framework, we remain focused on investing and enhancing our localized offering. In short, our unrivaled support and localized manufacturing benefit all of our value chain participants, our customers, our builders, and our contractors.
These benefits are part of the superior value proposition that differentiates James Hardie over other building materials providers and supports our growth aspirations by providing our partners with benefits that extend beyond the product. Now, I would like to hand it over to Rachel to share more details about our third quarter results. Rachel?
 Thank you, Aaron. Let's start on page 9 to discuss our global results for the third quarter. Our team has delivered a strong set of results in the third quarter compared to last year, with consistent and focused execution through the first nine months of our fiscal year. For the quarter, group net sales were up 14% year-over-year to $978.3 million. Adjusted net income increased 39% to $179.9 million. The global adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.7%, up 440 basis points and operating cash flow for the nine months was a record $749.5 million, up 73% year-over-year. Our team is focused on executing on our strategy, and these consistent results demonstrate the value of focused execution. Now, turning to slide 10. I'll detail our adjusted net income waterfall for the third quarter.
As mentioned, adjusted net income increased 39% or $50.7 million year-over-year to $179.9 million and was in line with guidance provided in November. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by strong EBIT growth in North America, which contributed $52.4 million to the increase in adjusted net income. The year-over-year increase was also supported by growth in APAC and EU, combined each regions contributed $12 million to the increase in adjusted net income. During the quarter and as part of our ongoing marketing investments to drive long-term growth, global SG&A investment, which includes corporate, increased 36% year-over-year to $156.3 million. This equates to 16% of revenue, up from 13.4% last year. Sequentially, global SG&A was up 2% compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2024.
The increase in investment primarily in our marketing 10-fold, reflects our continued focus on growing brand awareness and driving profitable share gains. In the last quarter, we've seen our James Hardie aided brand awareness inside an increase by 7%. Some of our key initiatives include increased marketing through advertising, sponsorships and trade marketing to drive consideration and conversion across the value chain. General corporate SG&A expenses increased primarily due to higher stock compensation expense, mainly a higher share price, as well as higher employee costs was partially offset by lower New Zealand weather tightness success. Our FY 2024 full year estimated adjusted tax rate is now updated to 22.8%. This compares to the FY 2023 full year tax rate of 20.1% and is higher in FY 2024, reflecting our geographic mix.
We are proud of our global teams for the way they've executed in a challenging market, we remain focused on consistent execution to similarly deliver in the fourth quarter. Let's now move to page 11 to discuss the North American results. Beginning with the top line results, North America net sales with $727 million was up 13% versus the prior corresponding period, and our average net sales price was up 3%. Volume of $766.5 million standard feet exceeded the top end of our guidance range. During the quarter, overall housing end markets improved as mortgage rates ease. However, major projects R&R remained down high single digits, while single-family new construction was up 7% in the September quarter. As a reminder, we use a one-quarter lag methodology as applied to single-family new construction macro data to better align the data to the timing of our reported sales.
Our quarterly volume increased of 9% year-over-year is against a mixed end market. Q3 volumes exceeded guidance and historical trends, in part due to customers fully buying the amount permissible prior to the January 1st price increase. When thinking about seasonality, it's noteworthy, but in October 2020, we moved our annual price increase to calendar year-end versus our fiscal year-end based on customer feedback to better align this to their fiscal year-end. Given this movement, and disregarding 2021 to 2022 due to supply allocations, we now expect a more easing North American volume distribution between Q3 and Q4. The 9% Q3 volume increased an expected 9% Q4 volume increase at the guidance midpoint, pilot success we are having. We are converting share against other competitive materials.
This reflects James Hardie's superior value proposition as outlined by Aaron in his opening remarks and our material conversion advantage in building products. Similar to the second quarter, our strategic initiative to partner with big builders helped drive continued volume growth in the South Central region, which is new construction dominant. This region outperformed our total North American volumes. In addition, our volumes in the Northwest have continued to remain strong as our execution focus has enabled us to take share. We are committed to serving both the new construction and R&R segments and continue to invest in the larger R&R market. Now, turning to margins. The North America EBIT margin improved by 570 basis points versus the prior corresponding period to a record 32.7% and similar to volumes were shipped above the top end of our guidance range.
EBIT dollars in the third quarter were up 37% to a record $237.8 million versus the prior corresponding period. EBIT benefited from a higher average net sales price as well as lower input costs, specifically pulp and freight. Looking to Q4 and as noted last quarter, we expect cement to remain a key headwind for our North American margins, given timing of our supply contracts and strong demand for cement globally. We additionally anticipate higher coal prices as well as an increase in our start-up ramp-up cost for Prattville 3. For the full year calendar 2024, some of our key input costs, as just mentioned, cement and pulp, are expected to markedly increase. During the quarter, SG&A investment increased 40% year-over-year, off of a low base in the prior year.
This investment is focused on our marketing tent-poles to drive long-term demand creation. As a percentage of sales, SG&A investment increased 2 percentage points. Despite housing market volatility, we are encouraged by our relative share performance. By partnering with our customers, the North America team delivered a strong third quarter results with record EBIT and EBIT margin. Let's now turn to Page 12 to discuss the Asia-Pacific results. Similar to North America, it was a strong third quarter for our Asia-Pacific segment. Net sales improved 21% versus the prior corresponding period to AUD206.3 million, The net sales improvement was driven by a 14% increase in our average net sales price and supported by a 6% increase in volumes. Volume growth was driven by recovery in New Zealand as well as APAC-focused strategies that have resulted in new customer acquisitions and successful co-creation with builders.
EBIT improved 34% to AUD56.7 million. The result was driven by a higher average net sales price, which more than offset an increase in cost of goods sold per unit. Despite both pulp and freight costs being lower in the quarter versus last year, caused increased modestly due to a higher price/mix of sales. SG&A investment increased 22% year-over-year as we continue to invest in long-term demand creation. As a percentage of sales, SG&A investments was largely unchanged year-over-year. The APAC EBIT margin improved by 280 basis points versus the prior corresponding period to 27.5%. Given our Q3 is seasonally weaker, this was a strong margin outcome relative to prior Q3 performances. Our Asia Pacific team has continued to partner with our customers to deliver a strong third quarter.
The Australian housing market remains challenged as the industry digests housing market affordability issues and a double-digit decline in building approval. Despite this backdrop, our teams are focused on driving profitable share gains. We will now turn to Page 13 to discuss the European results. Our European team had a solid third quarter as the team continues to execute well in a challenging market environment. The European market has declined double digits. As an example, drilling building permits were down 15% year-over-year in the three months to November. European net sales increased 8% to €109.3 million. The increase was primarily related to an 18% increase in ASP as well as the €4.2 million favorable true-up related to customer rebate estimates.
The growth in ASP was due to our strategic price increases and growth in high-value products. We continue to see our product mix shift towards our higher-value fiber cement offerings. We are working closely with our customers to provide products that are near with multi-family and single-family homes. During the quarter, our Fiber Gypsum volumes were down low double digits, whereas we experienced double-digit growth in our high-value products. We see strong opportunities ahead for our high-value products and recently were recognized by the German Design Council with an award in the category Of Excellent Product Design, Building and Elements. This recognized our latest innovation, the Hardie Architectural Panel Collection. The architectural panel collection has been developed in conjunction with European architects to specifically meet the design preferences of our European customers.
While our high-value products are growing off of a small base, they're becoming a larger part of the overall mix, namely with panel opportunities. On a combined basis, overall volumes declined 10%, which while significant represents a lower decline than the overall European market. EBIT improved year-over-year to €7.1 million, driven by a higher average net sales price, which more than offset higher cost of goods sold due to lower volumes and increased costs of gypsum and energy. Similar to other geographies, SG&A investments increased 30% year-over-year. As a percentage of sales, SG&A investment increased 3.5 percentage points. In the EU, these investments included creating dedicated sales teams to commercialize our panel’s portfolio across Europe and driving market initiatives, such as a series of events for architects in major European cities like Paris and London, as well as further advertising activities on major social media platforms to generate more leads.
EBIT margin improved by 500 basis points versus the prior corresponding period to 6.5%. We remain confident in delivering mid to high single-digit EBIT margins near term and the focus for the EU team is execution on growing high-value products. This strategic emphasis will support the longer-term margin expansion opportunity. Turning now to Page 14 to discuss cash flow, liquidity, capital allocation and capital expenditures. Our robust operating cash flows reflect our strong margins, which stem from the superior value proposition that we offer our customers, builders and contractors. In the nine months of FY 2024, our operating cash flow was $749.5 million. This record cash flow result was driven by strong financial results in all three regions and a working capital improvement of $121 million.
We continue to maintain a strong liquidity position with a Q3 net leverage ratio of 0.65x and liquidity of over $1 billion. We are stewards of investor capital. Our capital allocation framework is the first and foremost to invest in organic growth. We do this while maintaining a flexible balance sheet and deploying excess capital to our shareholders. During Q3, we repurchased 2.4 million shares for $75 million at an average per share price of US$32.11. For the nine months period, we repurchased 6.7 million shares for $196.3 million at an average price of $29.14. As we look to Q4, we plan to continue to repurchase shares under our US$250 million buyback program. Regarding capital expenditures. For the first nine months, capital expenditures totaled $328.2 million, we expect to spend approximately $550 million on capital expenditures in FY 2024, and we remain committed to keeping capacity ahead of the cost.
In Q4, we expect to complete Prattville sheet machine number three in over a 12-month period, we expect to incur start-up ramp-up costs of approximately $10 million. Looking into calendar year 2024, we are continuing to invest to prepare for future demand, and we are expecting CapEx to increase year-over-year. Key investments include early works for brown and greenfield capacity additions in North America and proven initiatives globally to unlock existing capacity, as well as investments in the Hardie operating system conditions. We have robust operating cash flows, substantial liquidity and a flexible balance sheet, which enables us to invest in profitable growth. I'll now turn it back over to Aaron.
 Thank you, Rachel. We have delivered a strong first nine months and another record quarterly result for adjusted net income. In addition, we have outperformed our end markets and volatile conditions. These results are proof points that we are accelerating through this cycle and taking share, all while we have increased our investment and long-term demand creation. Let's now move to page 16 to discuss our market outlook and guidance. For our largest market, North America, we are providing the calendar year 2024 market outlook data from several external data providers. The average estimate for single-family new construction is for growth of 5%. Multifamily new construction is forecasted to contract 21% and repair and remodel our largest end market is estimated to decline 2%.
Using these external ranges along with our assumed market segment exposures, the implied range for a blended addressable market is down 4% to up 6% with an average of flat. It will come as a surprise to you to see these third-party forecasts for our end market have improved over the last quarter and is supported by declining interest rate expectations. Over the last 18 months, I have seen us execute on our strategy and increase our investment in long-term demand creation. Our business and team are now in a stronger position to capitalize on the expected return to growth in our end markets over the years ahead. We remain laser-focused on driving profitable share gain and are demonstrating this with our market outperformance. If you turn to page 17, we have again provided the volume sensitivity analysis for FY 2024.
This sensitivity analysis was prepared in the same manner as last quarter, which assumes our current range of expectations for raw material costs and freight rates, while continuing to invest in growth as currently planned. These volumes are simply to provide context to our EBIT margin sensitivity in North America and should not be construed as volume guidance beyond fiscal year 2024. Regardless of how markets fluctuate, we remain focused on outperforming our end markets. Now please turn to page 18. Today, we are providing three points of guidance for our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. First, we expect North America volumes to be in the range of 750 million and 780 million standard feet. Second, we expect North America EBIT margins to be in the range of 30% to 32%.
And lastly, we expect global adjusted net income to be in the range of $165 million to $185 million. As I mentioned earlier, our team is energized and focused on driving profitable share gains, and we are positioned to deliver another strong financial result in our fourth quarter. Finally, please move to page 19. We at James Hardie, are a global growth company. Over the past several quarters, I have spoken to a few of these defining attributes. Last quarter, I spoke to the Hardie operating system and Zero Harm. In the first quarter, I highlighted James Hardie as the brand of choice, noting our premium products and our multi-segment focus. Today, I spoke about our premium service, which includes unrivaled support as well as localized supply chains.
You have also heard Rachel talk about our strong financial position, underpinned by our disciplined execution translating into sustained margin performance and superior cash generation. We remain focused on consistently delivering while continuing to invest in growth. This is evidenced by our investments in SG&A and CapEx as we remain focused on profitable share gain in our material conversion opportunity. And enhancing our growth efforts, I would be remiss to not mention a few of our foundational supports. Our experienced management team over the last 18 months or so you have seen our executive leadership team expand with key areas elevated and new talent and skills at it. Combined, this provides James Hardie with the stewardship that allows for focus and simultaneous execution across multiple key areas.

With 60% institutional ownership, James Hardie Industries plc (ASX:JHX) is a favorite amongst the big guns

If you want to know who really controls James Hardie Industries plc (
), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 60% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.
Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of James Hardie Industries.
Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.
As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in James Hardie Industries. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see James Hardie Industries' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in James Hardie Industries. Our data shows that BlackRock, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 6.8% of shares outstanding. With 5.7% and 5.4% of the shares outstanding respectively, Australian Super Pty Ltd and Invesco Ltd. are the second and third largest shareholders.
A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 14 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of James Hardie Industries plc in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own AU$24m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking 
With a 40% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over James Hardie Industries. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified 
 that you should be aware of.
If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check

Why James Hardie Industries Stock Is Falling Today

Building products manufacturer 
 
 seemingly delivered solid results, but investors appear more focused on what the company 
 say. Shares of James Hardie traded down 12% as of 1:30 p.m. ET Tuesday on tepid growth guidance, as well as the lack of any deal talk.
James Hardie makes a range of 
, including fiber cement siding that is more durable than wood alternatives. The company earned $0.41 per share in its fiscal third quarter ending Dec. 31 on revenue of $978.3 million, surpassing Wall Street's expectations for $0.39 per share in earnings on sales of $960 million.
Adjusted net income was up 39% year over year, sales were up 14%, and operating cash flow through the first nine months of the year is up 73% compared to the same period of fiscal 2023.
"Our last four quarterly results have demonstrated that we are accelerating through this cycle and taking share," CEO Aaron Erter said in a statement. "We have a superior value proposition that helps our customers grow and be successful."
Given the strength of the quarter, it is hard to understand investors' reaction to the stock. It could just be that expectations had gotten ahead of themselves.
Shares of James Hardie were up nearly 35% in the last three months leading up to the earnings announcement, in part thanks to rumors out of the company's native Australia that private equity might be interested in taking the company private. There was no reference to any deal talk in the earnings discussion, which could have led some deal speculators to take their gains and move on.
And the company's guidance didn't fully live up to the hype implied in the dramatic share rise. James Hardie expects fiscal fourth-quarter North American volumes to be in the range of 750 million to 780 million standard feet, or relatively flat compared to the 767 million standard feet of product shipped in the most recent quarter.
It is worth noting that the 767 million standard feet figure came in ahead of guidance, so perhaps James Hardie management is being overly conservative.
This is a well-run company with a desirable product and a stock that has basically gone nowhere over the past three years, as investors have worried about higher interest rates and what they would do to housing demand. If the stock were to fall further from here, it might be a good time for long-term-focused investors to put James Hardie on the radar.

Is James Hardie Industries plc (ASX:JHX) Expensive For A Reason? A Look At Its Intrinsic Value

Does the February share price for James Hardie Industries plc (
) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.
We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the 
.
We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:
 = US$4.5b
The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.7%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.0b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.7%– 2.2%) = US$19b
= TV / (1 + r)
= US$19b÷ ( 1 + 7.7%)
= US$9.0b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$14b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of AU$58.7, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.
Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at James Hardie Industries as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.013. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value lower than the current share price? For James Hardie Industries, we've compiled three essential aspects you should explore:
PS. Simply Wall St updates its DCF calculation for every Australian stock every day, so if you want to find the intrinsic value of any other stock just

Here's Why We Think James Hardie Industries (ASX:JHX) Is Well Worth Watching

It's common for many investors, especially those who are inexperienced, to buy shares in companies with a good story even if these companies are loss-making. But as Peter Lynch said in 
, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.
If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in 
 (
). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.
Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Recognition must be given to the that James Hardie Industries has grown EPS by 47% per year, over the last three years. Growth that fast may well be fleeting, but it should be more than enough to pique the interest of the wary stock pickers.
Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. It was a year of stability for James Hardie Industries as both revenue and EBIT margins remained have been flat over the past year. That's not a major concern but nor does it point to the long term growth we like to see.
You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.
While we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check 
?
We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a AU$27b company like James Hardie Industries. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. As a matter of fact, their holding is valued at US$25m. This considerable investment should help drive long-term value in the business. Despite being just 0.09% of the company, the value of that investment is enough to show insiders have plenty riding on the venture.
James Hardie Industries' earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. That sort of growth is nothing short of eye-catching, and the large investment held by insiders should certainly brighten the view of the company. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So at the surface level, James Hardie Industries is worth putting on your watchlist; after all, shareholders do well when the market underestimates fast growing companies.

Investors in James Hardie Industries (ASX:JHX) have seen splendid returns of 259% over the past five years

When you buy shares in a company, it's worth keeping in mind the possibility that it could fail, and you could lose your money. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can 
 more than 100%. Long term 
 (
) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 235% in five years.
With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.
In his essay 
 Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).
During five years of share price growth, James Hardie Industries achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 26% per year. That makes the EPS growth particularly close to the yearly share price growth of 27%. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.
You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).
It is of course excellent to see how James Hardie Industries has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. This 
 interactive report on James Hardie Industries' 
 is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.
We'd be remiss not to mention the difference between James Hardie Industries' 
 (TSR) and its 
. The TSR attempts to capture the value of dividends (as if they were reinvested) as well as any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings offered to shareholders. Dividends have been really beneficial for James Hardie Industries shareholders, and that cash payout contributed to why its TSR of 259%, over the last 5 years, is better than the share price return.
It's nice to see that James Hardie Industries shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 92% over the last year. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 29% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper.

Is James Hardie Industries plc's (ASX:JHX) Recent Performance Tethered To Its Attractive Financial Prospects?

Most readers would already know that James Hardie Industries' (ASX:JHX) stock increased by 7.8% over the past three months. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term financial health, we decided to study the company’s fundamentals to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on 
 ROE.
Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.
The 
 is:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for James Hardie Industries is:
28% = US$536m ÷ US$1.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).
The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each A$1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made A$0.28 in profit.
Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or "retains", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
First thing first, we like that James Hardie Industries has an impressive ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 9.9% the company's ROE is quite impressive. As a result, James Hardie Industries' exceptional 24% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise.
Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that the growth figure reported by James Hardie Industries compares quite favourably to the industry average, which shows a decline of 0.7% over the last few years.
The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. If you're wondering about James Hardie Industries''s valuation, check out 
, as compared to its industry.
While the company did pay out a portion of its dividend in the past, it currently doesn't pay a regular dividend. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.
Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 0.6% over the next three years. Despite the lower expected payout ratio, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much.
On the whole, we feel that James Hardie Industries' performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

Why We Like The Returns At James Hardie Industries (ASX:JHX)

To find a multi-bagger stock, what are the underlying trends we should look for in a business? Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing 
 on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's 
 of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in 
 (
) returns on capital, so let's have a look.
Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for James Hardie Industries, this is the formula:
0.22 = US$894m ÷ (US$4.8b - US$749m) 
.
So, 
 In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Basic Materials industry average of 9.4%.
Above you can see how the current ROCE for James Hardie Industries compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can 
 for 
James Hardie Industries' ROCE growth is quite impressive. The figures show that over the last five years, ROCE has grown 87% whilst employing roughly the same amount of capital. So it's likely that the business is now reaping the full benefits of its past investments, since the capital employed hasn't changed considerably. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward.
To sum it up, James Hardie Industries is collecting higher returns from the same amount of capital, and that's impressive. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if James Hardie Industries can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.
While James Hardie Industries looks impressive, no company is worth an infinite price. The

James Hardie Industries Announces Fourth Quarter And Fiscal Year 2024 Results

--(
)--
 today announced results for its fourth quarter ending 31 March 2024.
Speaking to the results, James Hardie CEO Aaron Erter said, "Our team’s focus remains simple: working safely, partnering with our customers, managing decisively, and controlling what we can control. This focus has enabled us to deliver a strong fourth quarter and fiscal year for Adjusted Net Income."
Mr. Erter continued, "I believe our fiscal year results are proof points that we are accelerating through this cycle and taking share. We have a superior value proposition that helps our customers grow profitably and be successful. Our team is focused on maintaining momentum and consistency to deliver strong financial results again in fiscal year 2025 as highlighted by our guidance range provided today. We are homeowner focused, customer and contractor driven, providing the entire value chain with world class products and services."
Net Sales increased 13% to US$735.2 million, attributable to Average Net Sales Price (ASP) growth of +4% and a 9% increase in volumes. Volume of 766 million standard feet was within the February guidance of 750 million to 780 million standard feet. EBIT increased 23% to US$233.0 million, supported by a higher ASP. Cash costs decreased, driven by lower pulp prices and Hardie Operating System (HOS) savings including plant improvements, which offset higher cement and freight costs. SG&A increased 46%, primarily attributable to Homeowner and Trade marketing initiatives and higher employee costs. Sequentially, SG&A was up 2% versus the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. EBIT margin improved 270 basis points to 31.7%.
Net Sales increased 5% to A$215.2 million due to ASP growth of +9%, partially offset by a 4% decrease in volumes. The decline in volumes was driven by Australia and the Philippines, partially offset by improved volumes in New Zealand. EBIT decreased 1% to A$58.6 million, driven by higher costs due to product mix as well as increased SG&A, partially offset by a higher ASP. SG&A increased 43%, primarily due to higher employee costs and increased marketing initiatives. Sequentially, SG&A was up 12% versus the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. EBIT margin declined 170 basis points to 27.2%.
Net Sales were flat, with a 5% increase in ASP, offset by volume decline of 9%. The growth in ASP resulted from our strategic price increases and growth in High Value Products. Lower volumes were driven by reduced market activity in Fiber Gypsum. EBIT of €12.1 million increased 53%, supported by a higher ASP, which offset lower overall volumes as well as increased investment in SG&A to drive growth initiatives. EBIT margin improved 360 basis points to 10.3%.
Operating cash flow increased 50% to a record US$914.2 million for fiscal year 2024. FY24 operating cash flow was driven by strong results in all three regions aided by HOS execution. Significant FY24 capital deployment included capital expenditures of US$449.3 million and share repurchases of US$271.4 million.
James Hardie Chief Financial Officer, Rachel Wilson, stated, "Our Q4 leverage ratio of 0.67x and our US$958.2 million of liquidity reflects our strong margins and cash generation. In Q4, we bought back 1.9 million shares at an average price of US$39.42, for total consideration of approximately US$75 million. We plan to continue to repurchase shares under our US$250 million buyback program.
Our capital allocation framework is unchanged. The primary focus of our capital allocation framework is to invest in organic growth."
Commenting on capital resources, Ms. Wilson stated "At James Hardie, we’ve grown our market share consistently over the last decade. Today, we are Homeowner focused, Customer and Contractor driven, which we expect will further drive demand for our products. To meet this expected demand, we fund capacity and keep development at various stages to flexibly meet profitable share gain. This includes optimizing existing capacity with HOS and HMOS improvements, as well as balancing brownfield and greenfield capacity development."
The outlook for the housing markets we participate in globally continues to remain uncertain. In our largest market, North America, the external data providers we utilize expect our addressable market to decrease 2%, with a range of down 6% to up 3%, in calendar year 2024 versus calendar year 2023. We plan to outperform the market, growing the business and investing for long-term success.
Guidance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025; includes:

This Media Release includes financial measures that are not considered a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), such as Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Diluted EPS. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered to be more meaningful than the equivalent GAAP measure. Management has included such measures to provide investors with an alternative method for assessing its operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of its ongoing operations and excludes the impact of certain legacy items, such as asbestos adjustments. Additionally, management uses such non-GAAP financial measures for the same purposes. However, these non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may not be reported by all of the Company’s competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of the Company’s competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation. The Company is unable to forecast the comparable US GAAP financial measure for future periods due to, amongst other factors, uncertainty regarding the impact of actuarial estimates on asbestos-related assets and liabilities in future periods.

In addition, this Media Release includes financial measures and descriptions that are considered to not be in accordance with GAAP, but which are consistent with financial measures reported by Australian companies, such as EBIT and EBIT margin.

Is It Time To Consider Buying James Hardie Industries plc (ASX:JHX)?

James Hardie Industries plc (
) saw significant share price movement during recent months on the ASX, rising to highs of AU$62.60 and falling to the lows of AU$53.14. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether James Hardie Industries' current trading price of AU$55.60 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at James Hardie Industries’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.
James Hardie Industries is currently expensive based on our price multiple model, where we look at the company's price-to-earnings ratio in comparison to the industry average. In this instance, we’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. We find that James Hardie Industries’s ratio of 29.73x is above its peer average of 23.92x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Basic Materials industry. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Given that James Hardie Industries’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.
Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 81% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for James Hardie Industries. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.
 JHX’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe JHX should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.
 If you’ve been keeping tabs on JHX for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for JHX, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

Top 3 ASX Stocks Estimated Below Market Value In July 2024

Amidst a generally positive trend in the Australian market, with the ASX200 closing up and most sectors showing gains, investors are keenly observing shifts in various sectors influenced by global economic signals and local corporate developments. In this context, identifying stocks that appear undervalued becomes crucial, as they may offer potential for growth especially when aligned with broader economic movements and sector-specific trends.
Here's a peek at a few of the choices from the screener.
 James Hardie Industries plc specializes in producing and selling fiber cement, fiber gypsum, and cement bonded building products for various building construction applications across the United States, Australia, Europe, New Zealand, and the Philippines, with a market capitalization of A$21.15 billion.
 The company's revenue is generated from three primary segments: Europe Building Products at $482.10 million, Asia Pacific Fiber Cement at $562.80 million, and North America Fiber Cement at $2.89 billion.
 27.5%
James Hardie Industries, trading at A$49.03, appears undervalued based on cash flows with a fair value estimate of A$67.58. Recent financials show stable net income with slight earnings growth expected (13.97% per year), outpacing the Australian market forecast (12.8% per year). Despite high debt levels, the firm is managing an aggressive buyback strategy, increasing its authorization by A$50 million recently and joining the S&P/ASX 20 Index, signaling robust market confidence and operational strength.
 Lotus Resources Limited is a company focused on the exploration, evaluation, and development of uranium properties in Australia and Africa, with a market capitalization of approximately A$668.59 million.
 The firm primarily generates revenue through its uranium exploration and development activities across Australia and Africa.
 34.5%
Lotus Resources, valued at A$0.37, is perceived as undervalued against a fair value estimate of A$0.56 based on discounted cash flows, reflecting a significant undervaluation. Despite generating less than A$1 million in revenue last year and experiencing shareholder dilution recently, the company is expected to become profitable within three years with an anticipated robust annual earnings growth and an exceptionally high return on equity forecasted at 69.3%. Analyst consensus suggests a potential price increase of 78.9%.
 Regal Partners Limited, a privately owned hedge fund sponsor, operates with a market capitalization of approximately A$1.10 billion.
 The company generates revenue primarily through the provision of investment management services, totaling A$105.28 million.
 42.3%
Regal Partners, currently priced at A$3.48, appears undervalued compared to its estimated fair value of A$6.03, suggesting a potential opportunity based on discounted cash flow analysis. The company has seen a 19.2% revenue increase over the past year and anticipates continued robust growth with revenue and earnings expected to rise by 21.2% and 32.3% per year respectively, outpacing the Australian market forecasts significantly. However, challenges include lower profit margins compared to last year and significant insider selling recently which could signal caution.

Top 3 ASX Stocks Estimated To Be Below Intrinsic Value In July 2024

Amidst a turbulent week where the ASX200 shed gains to close lower, investors face a challenging landscape marked by sector-wide declines and volatile commodity prices. In such an environment, identifying stocks that appear undervalued relative to their intrinsic value could offer potential opportunities for discerning investors looking to navigate these uncertain market conditions.
Let's review some notable picks from our screened stocks.
 Flight Centre Travel Group Limited operates as a travel retailer serving both leisure and corporate sectors across various regions including Australia, New Zealand, the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia with a market capitalization of approximately A$4.98 billion.
 The company generates revenue primarily through two segments: the leisure sector, which brought in A$1.28 billion, and the corporate sector, with A$1.06 billion in earnings.
 26.6%
Flight Centre Travel Group, trading at A$22.66, is positioned below the estimated fair value of A$30.88, indicating a significant undervaluation based on discounted cash flows. Recently profitable, FLT's earnings are expected to grow by 19.1% annually, outpacing the Australian market forecast of 13.5%. While its revenue growth at 9.7% per year also exceeds the national average of 5.6%, it does not reach the high-growth benchmark of over 20%.
 James Hardie Industries plc specializes in manufacturing and selling fiber cement, fiber gypsum, and cement bonded building products for various building construction applications, primarily serving markets in the United States, Australia, Europe, New Zealand, and the Philippines with a market capitalization of A$23.18 billion.
 The company's revenue is generated from three key segments: Europe Building Products at $482.10 million, Asia Pacific Fiber Cement at $562.80 million, and North America Fiber Cement at $2.89 billion.
 22%
James Hardie Industries, priced at A$53.73, shows potential underpricing with a fair value estimate of A$68.87. Its earnings and revenue are set to outperform the Australian market with forecasts of 14% and 8% growth respectively. However, its growth rates don't exceed the high threshold of 20%. Despite this moderate growth forecast, it remains attractive due to a trading price that's 22% below estimated fair value and recent strategic moves like expanding its buyback plan by A$50 million and inclusion in the S&P/ASX 20 Index.
 Webjet Limited operates as an online travel booking service across Australia, New Zealand, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and other international markets with a market capitalization of approximately A$3.51 billion.
 The company generates revenue through its Business to Business Travel (B2B) and Business to Consumer Travel (B2C) segments, totaling A$327.90 million and A$142.80 million respectively.
 13.1%
Webjet Limited, currently priced at A$8.97, is trading below the estimated fair value of A$10.32. With a revenue growth forecast of 10.6% per year and earnings expected to increase by 20.26% annually, it outpaces the Australian market's average growth rates in both metrics. Despite these positive indicators and a significant past earnings growth of 401.4%, Webjet's Return on Equity is projected to remain low at 15.9% in three years, suggesting potential concerns about future profitability efficiency amidst ongoing corporate restructuring, including a planned demerger aimed at enhancing operational focus and market positioning.

Exploring Value Opportunities On The ASX In July 2024

The Australian stock market has experienced a slight decline of 1.2% over the past week, though it still shows a robust annual growth of 8.6%, with earnings expected to grow by 13% per annum. In this context, identifying undervalued stocks can offer investors potential opportunities for growth, especially when certain assets may not fully reflect their future earning capabilities in their current prices.
Let's take a closer look at a couple of our picks from the screened companies.
 James Hardie Industries plc specializes in manufacturing and selling fiber cement, fiber gypsum, and cement bonded building products for various building construction applications, primarily in the United States, Australia, Europe, New Zealand, and the Philippines, with a market capitalization of approximately A$23.40 billion.
 The company's revenue is segmented into Europe Building Products at $482.10 million, Asia Pacific Fiber Cement at $562.80 million, and North America Fiber Cement at $2.89 billion.
 21.7%
James Hardie Industries, priced at A$54.24, is currently valued below its estimated fair value of A$69.25, indicating a potential undervaluation of over 20%. Despite a high debt level, the company's Return on Equity is expected to be strong at 27.8% in three years. Earnings are projected to grow by 14% annually, outpacing the Australian market forecast of 13.5%. Recent activities include an increased equity buyback plan by A$50 million and inclusion in the S&P/ASX 20 Index.
 Lovisa Holdings Limited operates in the fashion jewelry and accessories retail sector, with a market capitalization of approximately A$3.71 billion.
 The company generates its revenue primarily from the retail sale of fashion jewelry and accessories, totaling A$653.99 million.
 33.5%
Lovisa Holdings, priced at A$33.86, trades 33.5% below its fair value of A$50.91, suggesting significant undervaluation based on cash flows. While its revenue growth at 13.4% annually surpasses the Australian market's 5.6%, it's slower than the industry benchmark of 20%. Earnings are expected to increase by 17.3% yearly, outperforming the market forecast of 13.5%. The company’s Return on Equity is projected to be very high in three years at nearly double current figures.
 SiteMinder Limited, operating globally, provides online guest acquisition platforms and commerce solutions for accommodation providers, with a market capitalization of approximately A$1.46 billion.
 The company generates its revenue primarily through software and programming services, amounting to A$171.70 million.
 44.1%
SiteMinder, with a current price of A$5.3, appears undervalued by 44.1% against a calculated fair value of A$9.49, based on discounted cash flows. The company's revenue growth is projected at 19.1% annually, outpacing the Australian market's average of 5.6%. Although this growth rate is below the industry’s top performers at 20%, SiteMinder's expected profitability within three years and a forecasted high Return on Equity of 24.5% highlight its potential for value appreciation and financial improvement following its strategic partnership with Cloudbeds announced on June 11, 2024.

Why Shares in James Hardie Declined This Week

Shares in 
 
 declined 15.1% in the week through Friday morning. The negative result came when the fiber cement siding and fiber gypsum company reported disappointing fourth-quarter earnings.
The move is particularly notable because it contrasts the stock price move of its engineered wood siding and oriented strand board (OSB) rival 
 
.
The difference in performance is from Louisana-Pacific easily beating the first-quarter 2024 guidance management gave in February and significantly raising its full-year 2024 guidance. In contrast, James Hardie's fourth-quarter revenue and earnings were merely within guidance ranges, and its outlook for 2025 implies weakening sales trends.
For example, Louisiana-Pacific's outlook calls for its siding net sales to increase 11%- 13% in 2024, while James Hardie's earnings release states that we "expect our addressable market to decrease 2%, with a range of down 6% to up 3%." That's disappointing because back in February, management had said, "Expect our addressable market to be between a decrease of 4% and growth of 6% in calendar year 2024."
In other words, the midpoint of James Hardie's new guidance calls for a 2% decrease in its end markets in 2024, compared to a previous estimate of a 1% decline.
The revised market outlook has reset expectations, making the stock interesting as a potential play on a 
 recovery. At the same time, it calls into question Louisana-Pacific's outlook, and investors must keep a close eye on both companies. Ultimately, end market prospects for both companies will largely depend on the North American housing market's state, which depends on the interest rate cycle.
Ultimately, buying into either stock implies investing with an awareness that there will likely be volatility along the way as the market debates the timing and magnitude of interest rate cuts.

Why James Hardie Shares Are Dropping Today

 
 is feeling the pressure from a difficult housing cycle. Shares of the building materials manufacturer traded down 15% as of 1 p.m. ET Tuesday following the release of the company's latest quarterly report.
James Hardie is an Australian manufacturer of 
 best known for its Hardie Board fiber-cement house siding. The company earned $0.40 in the quarter on revenue of $1 billion, or about $10 million less than the analyst consensus estimate.
For its full fiscal year ending March 31, James Hardie saw sales grow by 4%.
James Hardie's fortunes are tied closely to the 
 and renovation markets, which have cooled in the U.S. and elsewhere due to rising interest rates. The company said it expects demand from its largest market, North America, to decrease by 2% in calendar 2024 compared to 2023.
It's worth noting that the company continues to grow revenue in a tough market, implying that James Hardie is having some success outperforming overall demand and perhaps taking market share. Cement fiber is considered superior to traditional alternatives due to its durability, but it also tends to cost more to install.
The company sells into cyclical markets, and James Hardie can only do so much to offset the cycle.
With Tuesday's declines, the stock is now 25% off its high for 2024. Expectations are being reset, and with any luck, the stock doesn't have much further to fall. Investors buying in now will need to have patience as they ride out the cycle.

JHX Investor Day 2024 Presentation – Day Two

--(
)--James Hardie today released its Investor Day 2024 Presentation – Day Two Materials. This event is being held in New York, NY on Monday, 24 June 2024. Copies of this document are available on James Hardie’s Investor Relations website at 
.
Speaking to the company’s long-term aspirations, James Hardie CEO Aaron Erter said, "Over the last two decades, James Hardie products have improved the aesthetics and durability of 11+ million homes in North America. The underlying fundamentals of our end markets have never been more supportive of long-term growth. Enabled by our strategy of being Homeowner Focused, Customer and Contractor Driven™, we can aspire to more than double our presence in the market in the coming decade to ~25 million homes with James Hardie."
Mr. Erter went on to discuss certain financial implications of this goal:
"Our ability to expand the reach of our products through capitalizing on underlying market growth and the material conversion opportunity, coupled with gaining share through our superior value proposition across the value chain allows us to aspire to double-digit revenue growth over the long-term".
James Hardie CFO Rachel Wilson said, "The aspirations laid out today illustrate that we are a growth company, but we are also grounded as an organization around delivering profitable growth, sustaining our strong returns on capital and generating attractive returns to shareholders."
Today, James Hardie also announced that its Board has approved a US$50 million increase to its existing share buyback program. The company can now purchase up to US$300 million of common stock as part of this program. As of 24 June 2024, US$225 million has been utilized, leaving a remaining authorization of US$75 million.

With 60% institutional ownership, James Hardie Industries plc (ASX:JHX) is a favorite amongst the big guns

If you want to know who really controls James Hardie Industries plc (
), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 60% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.
Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of James Hardie Industries.
Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.
As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in James Hardie Industries. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see James Hardie Industries' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in James Hardie Industries. Our data shows that BlackRock, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 6.8% of shares outstanding. With 5.7% and 5.4% of the shares outstanding respectively, Australian Super Pty Ltd and Invesco Ltd. are the second and third largest shareholders.
A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 14 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of James Hardie Industries plc in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own AU$24m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking 
With a 40% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over James Hardie Industries. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified 
 that you should be aware of.
If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check

Why James Hardie Industries Stock Is Falling Today

Building products manufacturer 
 
 seemingly delivered solid results, but investors appear more focused on what the company 
 say. Shares of James Hardie traded down 12% as of 1:30 p.m. ET Tuesday on tepid growth guidance, as well as the lack of any deal talk.
James Hardie makes a range of 
, including fiber cement siding that is more durable than wood alternatives. The company earned $0.41 per share in its fiscal third quarter ending Dec. 31 on revenue of $978.3 million, surpassing Wall Street's expectations for $0.39 per share in earnings on sales of $960 million.
Adjusted net income was up 39% year over year, sales were up 14%, and operating cash flow through the first nine months of the year is up 73% compared to the same period of fiscal 2023.
"Our last four quarterly results have demonstrated that we are accelerating through this cycle and taking share," CEO Aaron Erter said in a statement. "We have a superior value proposition that helps our customers grow and be successful."
Given the strength of the quarter, it is hard to understand investors' reaction to the stock. It could just be that expectations had gotten ahead of themselves.
Shares of James Hardie were up nearly 35% in the last three months leading up to the earnings announcement, in part thanks to rumors out of the company's native Australia that private equity might be interested in taking the company private. There was no reference to any deal talk in the earnings discussion, which could have led some deal speculators to take their gains and move on.
And the company's guidance didn't fully live up to the hype implied in the dramatic share rise. James Hardie expects fiscal fourth-quarter North American volumes to be in the range of 750 million to 780 million standard feet, or relatively flat compared to the 767 million standard feet of product shipped in the most recent quarter.
It is worth noting that the 767 million standard feet figure came in ahead of guidance, so perhaps James Hardie management is being overly conservative.
This is a well-run company with a desirable product and a stock that has basically gone nowhere over the past three years, as investors have worried about higher interest rates and what they would do to housing demand. If the stock were to fall further from here, it might be a good time for long-term-focused investors to put James Hardie on the radar.

James Hardie Industries plc (NYSE:
) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript February 12, 2024
James Hardie Industries plc isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (
).
 Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the James Hardie Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Results Briefing. Today's briefing is hosted by James Hardie CEO, Mr. Aaron Erter and CFO, Mrs. Rachel Wilson. After the briefing, we will open the lines to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] After the Q&A, I'll turn it back to Mr. Erter for closing remarks. I would now like to hand the conference over to James Hardie CEO, Mr. Aaron Erter. Please go ahead, sir.
 Thank you, operator. Good morning and good evening to everyone and welcome to our third quarter fiscal year 2024 results briefing. Turning to Page 2, you will see our standard cautionary note on forward-looking statements. Please note that the presentation today does contain forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial information. Also, except where we explicitly state otherwise during our prepared remarks, all references to monetary amounts should be assumed to be in US dollars. Moving to Page 3, you will see our agenda for today. Joining me is our CFO, Rachel Wilson. For today's call, I will start by providing a strategy and operations update. Rachel will then discuss our financial results, and I will return to discuss our outlook, guidance, and provide a brief closing.
We will then open it up for questions. Before I share an update on our strategy and operations, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our employees around the world who remain focused on safely delivering the highest quality products, solutions, and services to our customer partners. Our employees truly represent the very best in our industry and consistently enable our superior value proposition. Let's start on Page 5 with a brief business update. Our team's focus remains simple; working safely, partnering with our customers, investing in long-term growth, and driving profitable share gain. Our third quarter results continue to highlight how impactful that focus has been. For the third quarter, we achieved global net sales of $978.3 million, up 14% versus the prior corresponding period, with a record quarterly global adjusted net income of $179.9 million, up 39% versus the prior corresponding period.
Both our global net sales and adjusted net income results were again supported by volumes in North America that has outperformed the market. Our third quarter North American volume of $766.5 million standard feet exceeded the top end of our guidance range, and we delivered that with a record 32.7% EBIT margin. The adjusted net income result was also supported by strong year-over-year financial results in our Asia-Pacific region. In the EU, business performance improved year-over-year and we are seeing momentum in growing our high-value products. For the first nine months of the year, we generated record operating cash flow of $749.5 million, up 73% year-over-year. Similar to last quarter, we have continued to accelerate our investment in long-term growth, supporting our marketing tent-poles, driving awareness and conversion in targeted regions to aid in sustaining profitable share gain.
Rachel will share additional details in the financial section. While uncertainty continues to affect our end markets, our focus remains on partnering with our customers and controlling what we can control to outperform in the markets we participate. Now please turn to Page 6 in our global strategic framework. As I continue to emphasize, at the heart of our global strategy, we are homeowner-focused, customer and contractor-driven. With that in mind, all three regions remain focused on our three key strategic initiatives. Number one, profitably grow and take share where we have the right to win. Number two, bring our customers high-value differentiated solutions. And number three, connect and influence all the participants in the customer value chain.
I remain confident in our team and our strategy. Combined, they position us to execute at a high level and drive profitable share gains in all three regions. We accelerate our strategic initiatives by establishing competitive advantages through our strategic enablers without compromising on our foundational imperatives. Today, I will discuss two specific components of our value proposition, unrivaled support and localized manufacturing. Let's now turn to Slide 7 to discuss those components in greater detail. At James Hardie, we offer superior products and services to all participants in our value chain. Beyond the high performance of our product offerings, our unrivaled support and localized manufacturing are both key components of the superior value proposition that we offer our customers, builders and contractors.
Unrivaled support is about enhancing the experience for our value chain participants before and after the purchase of our products. Using our North America business, which is led by Sean Gadd, as an example, some of the ways we support value chain participants include; number one, our Customer Integration program. This program enables our customers, in this case, our distribution partners to assess demand, manage stock and inventory positions and ensure that they have the right products at the right place and at the right time. This program also helps our customers and our manufacturing teams plan more efficiently to ensure high levels of service, while optimizing the use of working capital. Number two, Dream Builder events. Some of you will remember this as brand days from our Investor Day in 2022.
At our Dream Builder events, we bring together key customers and contractors with our sales teams to learn more about how to market and sell James Hardie products. These interactive in-person events cover everything from initial home design decisions to the installation of James Hardie products, providing insights and engagement from the beginning to the end of the process. In effect, we are driving the number of contractors pitching James Hardie products in the home. We have doubled the amount of such events held in FY 2024 versus FY 2023. Number three, our Contractor Alliance Program, or CAP, for short, is a membership program for our R&R contractors. The program offers tiered and tailored support and services to meet the varied needs of our contractors regardless of size.
Support includes the sharing of leads or referrals generated through the James Hardie website portal. Supplying our customers with high-quality leads is a key differentiator for James Hardie, high-quality leads benefit both new contractors, just starting out with James Hardie and long-term contractors alike. Contractors value these leads as they are real currency for the success of their businesses. Program members also have access to local sales support, technical training on using our products, and installation support. All of these help our contractors improve the quality and efficiency of installing our products and ultimately assist in lowering the on-the-wall costs for their customers, increasing the overall value they provide homeowners.
And finally, program members have access to co-branded marketing materials like jobs type marketing kits and curated social media packages, which ensure our collective messaging is aligned and impactful. These materials boost the contractor's local presence in the community with the intention of increasing awareness for the contractor, as well as driving James Hardie's presence in their neighborhood. As an example, for every contractor's completed home that utilizes this localized marketing, they can expect to generate on average an incremental 12 leads and an additional two more jobs sold. Our unrivaled support is part of our homeowner-focused, customer and contractor-driven mindset. We are investing in our customers and contractors to help grow their businesses, which will help drive ongoing material conversion towards James Hardie fiber cement.
Localized manufacturing is another part of our superior value proposition for customers, builders, and contractors. We are physically close to our customers. We operate 10 manufacturing sites across the US, enabling a local presence to support our customers' changing needs and differentiating us from our competition. In FY 2023, approximately 70% of our products were delivered within 500 miles of one of our plants. This enables us to provide our customers and partners with reliable and responsive customer support services, limiting exposure to the risk inherent in extended supply chains. Our plants are conveniently located near key sources of raw materials. In FY 2023, approximately 80% of our raw materials were sourced within 150 miles of our plants.
This close proximity provides our plants with efficient sourcing, which helps to minimize freight costs and the carbon footprint of our supply chains. Finally, we invest in and support the communities within which we operate. In FY 2023, we contributed $1.85 billion in incremental growth and economic activity through capital expenditure at our plants, investing in our employees and local ecosystems and across our supplier base. The benefits of our localized manufacturing are long lasting and through our capital allocation framework, we remain focused on investing and enhancing our localized offering. In short, our unrivaled support and localized manufacturing benefit all of our value chain participants, our customers, our builders, and our contractors.
These benefits are part of the superior value proposition that differentiates James Hardie over other building materials providers and supports our growth aspirations by providing our partners with benefits that extend beyond the product. Now, I would like to hand it over to Rachel to share more details about our third quarter results. Rachel?
 Thank you, Aaron. Let's start on page 9 to discuss our global results for the third quarter. Our team has delivered a strong set of results in the third quarter compared to last year, with consistent and focused execution through the first nine months of our fiscal year. For the quarter, group net sales were up 14% year-over-year to $978.3 million. Adjusted net income increased 39% to $179.9 million. The global adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.7%, up 440 basis points and operating cash flow for the nine months was a record $749.5 million, up 73% year-over-year. Our team is focused on executing on our strategy, and these consistent results demonstrate the value of focused execution. Now, turning to slide 10. I'll detail our adjusted net income waterfall for the third quarter.
As mentioned, adjusted net income increased 39% or $50.7 million year-over-year to $179.9 million and was in line with guidance provided in November. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by strong EBIT growth in North America, which contributed $52.4 million to the increase in adjusted net income. The year-over-year increase was also supported by growth in APAC and EU, combined each regions contributed $12 million to the increase in adjusted net income. During the quarter and as part of our ongoing marketing investments to drive long-term growth, global SG&A investment, which includes corporate, increased 36% year-over-year to $156.3 million. This equates to 16% of revenue, up from 13.4% last year. Sequentially, global SG&A was up 2% compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2024.
The increase in investment primarily in our marketing 10-fold, reflects our continued focus on growing brand awareness and driving profitable share gains. In the last quarter, we've seen our James Hardie aided brand awareness inside an increase by 7%. Some of our key initiatives include increased marketing through advertising, sponsorships and trade marketing to drive consideration and conversion across the value chain. General corporate SG&A expenses increased primarily due to higher stock compensation expense, mainly a higher share price, as well as higher employee costs was partially offset by lower New Zealand weather tightness success. Our FY 2024 full year estimated adjusted tax rate is now updated to 22.8%. This compares to the FY 2023 full year tax rate of 20.1% and is higher in FY 2024, reflecting our geographic mix.
We are proud of our global teams for the way they've executed in a challenging market, we remain focused on consistent execution to similarly deliver in the fourth quarter. Let's now move to page 11 to discuss the North American results. Beginning with the top line results, North America net sales with $727 million was up 13% versus the prior corresponding period, and our average net sales price was up 3%. Volume of $766.5 million standard feet exceeded the top end of our guidance range. During the quarter, overall housing end markets improved as mortgage rates ease. However, major projects R&R remained down high single digits, while single-family new construction was up 7% in the September quarter. As a reminder, we use a one-quarter lag methodology as applied to single-family new construction macro data to better align the data to the timing of our reported sales.
Our quarterly volume increased of 9% year-over-year is against a mixed end market. Q3 volumes exceeded guidance and historical trends, in part due to customers fully buying the amount permissible prior to the January 1st price increase. When thinking about seasonality, it's noteworthy, but in October 2020, we moved our annual price increase to calendar year-end versus our fiscal year-end based on customer feedback to better align this to their fiscal year-end. Given this movement, and disregarding 2021 to 2022 due to supply allocations, we now expect a more easing North American volume distribution between Q3 and Q4. The 9% Q3 volume increased an expected 9% Q4 volume increase at the guidance midpoint, pilot success we are having. We are converting share against other competitive materials.
This reflects James Hardie's superior value proposition as outlined by Aaron in his opening remarks and our material conversion advantage in building products. Similar to the second quarter, our strategic initiative to partner with big builders helped drive continued volume growth in the South Central region, which is new construction dominant. This region outperformed our total North American volumes. In addition, our volumes in the Northwest have continued to remain strong as our execution focus has enabled us to take share. We are committed to serving both the new construction and R&R segments and continue to invest in the larger R&R market. Now, turning to margins. The North America EBIT margin improved by 570 basis points versus the prior corresponding period to a record 32.7% and similar to volumes were shipped above the top end of our guidance range.
EBIT dollars in the third quarter were up 37% to a record $237.8 million versus the prior corresponding period. EBIT benefited from a higher average net sales price as well as lower input costs, specifically pulp and freight. Looking to Q4 and as noted last quarter, we expect cement to remain a key headwind for our North American margins, given timing of our supply contracts and strong demand for cement globally. We additionally anticipate higher coal prices as well as an increase in our start-up ramp-up cost for Prattville 3. For the full year calendar 2024, some of our key input costs, as just mentioned, cement and pulp, are expected to markedly increase. During the quarter, SG&A investment increased 40% year-over-year, off of a low base in the prior year.
This investment is focused on our marketing tent-poles to drive long-term demand creation. As a percentage of sales, SG&A investment increased 2 percentage points. Despite housing market volatility, we are encouraged by our relative share performance. By partnering with our customers, the North America team delivered a strong third quarter results with record EBIT and EBIT margin. Let's now turn to Page 12 to discuss the Asia-Pacific results. Similar to North America, it was a strong third quarter for our Asia-Pacific segment. Net sales improved 21% versus the prior corresponding period to AUD206.3 million, The net sales improvement was driven by a 14% increase in our average net sales price and supported by a 6% increase in volumes. Volume growth was driven by recovery in New Zealand as well as APAC-focused strategies that have resulted in new customer acquisitions and successful co-creation with builders.
EBIT improved 34% to AUD56.7 million. The result was driven by a higher average net sales price, which more than offset an increase in cost of goods sold per unit. Despite both pulp and freight costs being lower in the quarter versus last year, caused increased modestly due to a higher price/mix of sales. SG&A investment increased 22% year-over-year as we continue to invest in long-term demand creation. As a percentage of sales, SG&A investments was largely unchanged year-over-year. The APAC EBIT margin improved by 280 basis points versus the prior corresponding period to 27.5%. Given our Q3 is seasonally weaker, this was a strong margin outcome relative to prior Q3 performances. Our Asia Pacific team has continued to partner with our customers to deliver a strong third quarter.
The Australian housing market remains challenged as the industry digests housing market affordability issues and a double-digit decline in building approval. Despite this backdrop, our teams are focused on driving profitable share gains. We will now turn to Page 13 to discuss the European results. Our European team had a solid third quarter as the team continues to execute well in a challenging market environment. The European market has declined double digits. As an example, drilling building permits were down 15% year-over-year in the three months to November. European net sales increased 8% to €109.3 million. The increase was primarily related to an 18% increase in ASP as well as the €4.2 million favorable true-up related to customer rebate estimates.
The growth in ASP was due to our strategic price increases and growth in high-value products. We continue to see our product mix shift towards our higher-value fiber cement offerings. We are working closely with our customers to provide products that are near with multi-family and single-family homes. During the quarter, our Fiber Gypsum volumes were down low double digits, whereas we experienced double-digit growth in our high-value products. We see strong opportunities ahead for our high-value products and recently were recognized by the German Design Council with an award in the category Of Excellent Product Design, Building and Elements. This recognized our latest innovation, the Hardie Architectural Panel Collection. The architectural panel collection has been developed in conjunction with European architects to specifically meet the design preferences of our European customers.
While our high-value products are growing off of a small base, they're becoming a larger part of the overall mix, namely with panel opportunities. On a combined basis, overall volumes declined 10%, which while significant represents a lower decline than the overall European market. EBIT improved year-over-year to €7.1 million, driven by a higher average net sales price, which more than offset higher cost of goods sold due to lower volumes and increased costs of gypsum and energy. Similar to other geographies, SG&A investments increased 30% year-over-year. As a percentage of sales, SG&A investment increased 3.5 percentage points. In the EU, these investments included creating dedicated sales teams to commercialize our panel’s portfolio across Europe and driving market initiatives, such as a series of events for architects in major European cities like Paris and London, as well as further advertising activities on major social media platforms to generate more leads.
EBIT margin improved by 500 basis points versus the prior corresponding period to 6.5%. We remain confident in delivering mid to high single-digit EBIT margins near term and the focus for the EU team is execution on growing high-value products. This strategic emphasis will support the longer-term margin expansion opportunity. Turning now to Page 14 to discuss cash flow, liquidity, capital allocation and capital expenditures. Our robust operating cash flows reflect our strong margins, which stem from the superior value proposition that we offer our customers, builders and contractors. In the nine months of FY 2024, our operating cash flow was $749.5 million. This record cash flow result was driven by strong financial results in all three regions and a working capital improvement of $121 million.
We continue to maintain a strong liquidity position with a Q3 net leverage ratio of 0.65x and liquidity of over $1 billion. We are stewards of investor capital. Our capital allocation framework is the first and foremost to invest in organic growth. We do this while maintaining a flexible balance sheet and deploying excess capital to our shareholders. During Q3, we repurchased 2.4 million shares for $75 million at an average per share price of US$32.11. For the nine months period, we repurchased 6.7 million shares for $196.3 million at an average price of $29.14. As we look to Q4, we plan to continue to repurchase shares under our US$250 million buyback program. Regarding capital expenditures. For the first nine months, capital expenditures totaled $328.2 million, we expect to spend approximately $550 million on capital expenditures in FY 2024, and we remain committed to keeping capacity ahead of the cost.
In Q4, we expect to complete Prattville sheet machine number three in over a 12-month period, we expect to incur start-up ramp-up costs of approximately $10 million. Looking into calendar year 2024, we are continuing to invest to prepare for future demand, and we are expecting CapEx to increase year-over-year. Key investments include early works for brown and greenfield capacity additions in North America and proven initiatives globally to unlock existing capacity, as well as investments in the Hardie operating system conditions. We have robust operating cash flows, substantial liquidity and a flexible balance sheet, which enables us to invest in profitable growth. I'll now turn it back over to Aaron.
 Thank you, Rachel. We have delivered a strong first nine months and another record quarterly result for adjusted net income. In addition, we have outperformed our end markets and volatile conditions. These results are proof points that we are accelerating through this cycle and taking share, all while we have increased our investment and long-term demand creation. Let's now move to page 16 to discuss our market outlook and guidance. For our largest market, North America, we are providing the calendar year 2024 market outlook data from several external data providers. The average estimate for single-family new construction is for growth of 5%. Multifamily new construction is forecasted to contract 21% and repair and remodel our largest end market is estimated to decline 2%.
Using these external ranges along with our assumed market segment exposures, the implied range for a blended addressable market is down 4% to up 6% with an average of flat. It will come as a surprise to you to see these third-party forecasts for our end market have improved over the last quarter and is supported by declining interest rate expectations. Over the last 18 months, I have seen us execute on our strategy and increase our investment in long-term demand creation. Our business and team are now in a stronger position to capitalize on the expected return to growth in our end markets over the years ahead. We remain laser-focused on driving profitable share gain and are demonstrating this with our market outperformance. If you turn to page 17, we have again provided the volume sensitivity analysis for FY 2024.
This sensitivity analysis was prepared in the same manner as last quarter, which assumes our current range of expectations for raw material costs and freight rates, while continuing to invest in growth as currently planned. These volumes are simply to provide context to our EBIT margin sensitivity in North America and should not be construed as volume guidance beyond fiscal year 2024. Regardless of how markets fluctuate, we remain focused on outperforming our end markets. Now please turn to page 18. Today, we are providing three points of guidance for our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. First, we expect North America volumes to be in the range of 750 million and 780 million standard feet. Second, we expect North America EBIT margins to be in the range of 30% to 32%.
And lastly, we expect global adjusted net income to be in the range of $165 million to $185 million. As I mentioned earlier, our team is energized and focused on driving profitable share gains, and we are positioned to deliver another strong financial result in our fourth quarter. Finally, please move to page 19. We at James Hardie, are a global growth company. Over the past several quarters, I have spoken to a few of these defining attributes. Last quarter, I spoke to the Hardie operating system and Zero Harm. In the first quarter, I highlighted James Hardie as the brand of choice, noting our premium products and our multi-segment focus. Today, I spoke about our premium service, which includes unrivaled support as well as localized supply chains.
You have also heard Rachel talk about our strong financial position, underpinned by our disciplined execution translating into sustained margin performance and superior cash generation. We remain focused on consistently delivering while continuing to invest in growth. This is evidenced by our investments in SG&A and CapEx as we remain focused on profitable share gain in our material conversion opportunity. And enhancing our growth efforts, I would be remiss to not mention a few of our foundational supports. Our experienced management team over the last 18 months or so you have seen our executive leadership team expand with key areas elevated and new talent and skills at it. Combined, this provides James Hardie with the stewardship that allows for focus and simultaneous execution across multiple key areas.
This includes establishing the Hardie operating system targets, our continued investment in our people, ESG disclosure and commitments centralized procurement and R&D focus as well as targeted investment and demand creation. All of these efforts combined to drive our ongoing material conversion and profitable share gain. Attractive returns, over the last nine months, our focus on forecast accuracy and consistent execution has enabled our business to deliver on our commitments. While there are many financial return metrics I can point to, the North American EBIT growth over the last nine months of 19% year-over-year and what has been challenging conditions with an EBIT margin of 31.9% provides one such data point. I am proud of our team's ongoing ability to navigate market conditions and execute consistently, delivering a strong third quarter result and demonstrating operational momentum as we head into the fourth quarter.
We are homeowner focused customer and contractor driven. Before I open it up to Q&A, I would like to highlight our upcoming 2024 Investor Day in late June. We are hosting a two-day event in North America, showcasing our value proposition in the field with some of our customers and partners. We look forward to showing you firsthand our value proposition and how we are driving profitable share gain. If you haven't already, please use this link to register your interest. The save the date registry will close at the end of February. With that, I would like the operator to open the line up for questions.

Is James Hardie Industries plc (ASX:JHX) Expensive For A Reason? A Look At Its Intrinsic Value

Does the February share price for James Hardie Industries plc (
) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.
We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the 
.
We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:
 = US$4.5b
The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.7%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.0b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.7%– 2.2%) = US$19b
= TV / (1 + r)
= US$19b÷ ( 1 + 7.7%)
= US$9.0b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$14b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of AU$58.7, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.
Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at James Hardie Industries as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.013. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value lower than the current share price? For James Hardie Industries, we've compiled three essential aspects you should explore:
PS. Simply Wall St updates its DCF calculation for every Australian stock every day, so if you want to find the intrinsic value of any other stock just

Here's Why We Think James Hardie Industries (ASX:JHX) Is Well Worth Watching

It's common for many investors, especially those who are inexperienced, to buy shares in companies with a good story even if these companies are loss-making. But as Peter Lynch said in 
, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.
If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in 
 (
). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.
Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Recognition must be given to the that James Hardie Industries has grown EPS by 47% per year, over the last three years. Growth that fast may well be fleeting, but it should be more than enough to pique the interest of the wary stock pickers.
Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. It was a year of stability for James Hardie Industries as both revenue and EBIT margins remained have been flat over the past year. That's not a major concern but nor does it point to the long term growth we like to see.
You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.
While we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check 
?
We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a AU$27b company like James Hardie Industries. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. As a matter of fact, their holding is valued at US$25m. This considerable investment should help drive long-term value in the business. Despite being just 0.09% of the company, the value of that investment is enough to show insiders have plenty riding on the venture.
James Hardie Industries' earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. That sort of growth is nothing short of eye-catching, and the large investment held by insiders should certainly brighten the view of the company. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So at the surface level, James Hardie Industries is worth putting on your watchlist; after all, shareholders do well when the market underestimates fast growing companies. Of course, just because James Hardie Industries is growing does not mean it is undervalued. If you're wondering about the valuation, check out

Investors in James Hardie Industries (ASX:JHX) have seen splendid returns of 259% over the past five years

When you buy shares in a company, it's worth keeping in mind the possibility that it could fail, and you could lose your money. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can 
 more than 100%. Long term 
 (
) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 235% in five years.
With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.
In his essay 
 Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).
During five years of share price growth, James Hardie Industries achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 26% per year. That makes the EPS growth particularly close to the yearly share price growth of 27%. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.
You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).
It is of course excellent to see how James Hardie Industries has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. This 
 interactive report on James Hardie Industries' 
 is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.
We'd be remiss not to mention the difference between James Hardie Industries' 
 (TSR) and its 
. The TSR attempts to capture the value of dividends (as if they were reinvested) as well as any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings offered to shareholders. Dividends have been really beneficial for James Hardie Industries shareholders, and that cash payout contributed to why its TSR of 259%, over the last 5 years, is better than the share price return.
It's nice to see that James Hardie Industries shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 92% over the last year. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 29% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper.

Why We Like The Returns At James Hardie Industries (ASX:JHX)

To find a multi-bagger stock, what are the underlying trends we should look for in a business? Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing 
 on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's 
 of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in 
 (
) returns on capital, so let's have a look.
Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for James Hardie Industries, this is the formula:
0.22 = US$894m ÷ (US$4.8b - US$749m) 
.
So, 
 In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Basic Materials industry average of 9.4%.
Above you can see how the current ROCE for James Hardie Industries compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can 
 for 
James Hardie Industries' ROCE growth is quite impressive. The figures show that over the last five years, ROCE has grown 87% whilst employing roughly the same amount of capital. So it's likely that the business is now reaping the full benefits of its past investments, since the capital employed hasn't changed considerably. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward.
To sum it up, James Hardie Industries is collecting higher returns from the same amount of capital, and that's impressive. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if James Hardie Industries can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.
While James Hardie Industries looks impressive, no company is worth an infinite price. The 
 helps visualize whether it is currently trading for a fair price.

Is It Time To Consider Buying James Hardie Industries plc (ASX:JHX)?

James Hardie Industries plc (
) saw significant share price movement during recent months on the ASX, rising to highs of AU$62.60 and falling to the lows of AU$53.14. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether James Hardie Industries' current trading price of AU$55.60 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at James Hardie Industries’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.
James Hardie Industries is currently expensive based on our price multiple model, where we look at the company's price-to-earnings ratio in comparison to the industry average. In this instance, we’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. We find that James Hardie Industries’s ratio of 29.73x is above its peer average of 23.92x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Basic Materials industry. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Given that James Hardie Industries’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.
Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 81% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for James Hardie Industries. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.
 JHX’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe JHX should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.
 If you’ve been keeping tabs on JHX for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for JHX, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

Is James Hardie Industries plc's (ASX:JHX) Recent Performance Tethered To Its Attractive Financial Prospects?

Most readers would already know that James Hardie Industries' (ASX:JHX) stock increased by 7.8% over the past three months. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term financial health, we decided to study the company’s fundamentals to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on 
 ROE.
Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.
The 
 is:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for James Hardie Industries is:
28% = US$536m ÷ US$1.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).
The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each A$1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made A$0.28 in profit.
Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or "retains", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
First thing first, we like that James Hardie Industries has an impressive ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 9.9% the company's ROE is quite impressive. As a result, James Hardie Industries' exceptional 24% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise.
Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that the growth figure reported by James Hardie Industries compares quite favourably to the industry average, which shows a decline of 0.7% over the last few years.
The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. If you're wondering about James Hardie Industries''s valuation, check out 
, as compared to its industry.
While the company did pay out a portion of its dividend in the past, it currently doesn't pay a regular dividend. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.
Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 0.6% over the next three years. Despite the lower expected payout ratio, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much.
On the whole, we feel that James Hardie Industries' performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?
 
================================================================================

Why Shares in James Hardie Declined This Week

Shares in 
 
 declined 15.1% in the week through Friday morning. The negative result came when the fiber cement siding and fiber gypsum company reported disappointing fourth-quarter earnings.
The move is particularly notable because it contrasts the stock price move of its engineered wood siding and oriented strand board (OSB) rival 
 
.
The difference in performance is from Louisana-Pacific easily beating the first-quarter 2024 guidance management gave in February and significantly raising its full-year 2024 guidance. In contrast, James Hardie's fourth-quarter revenue and earnings were merely within guidance ranges, and its outlook for 2025 implies weakening sales trends.
For example, Louisiana-Pacific's outlook calls for its siding net sales to increase 11%- 13% in 2024, while James Hardie's earnings release states that we "expect our addressable market to decrease 2%, with a range of down 6% to up 3%." That's disappointing because back in February, management had said, "Expect our addressable market to be between a decrease of 4% and growth of 6% in calendar year 2024."
In other words, the midpoint of James Hardie's new guidance calls for a 2% decrease in its end markets in 2024, compared to a previous estimate of a 1% decline.
The revised market outlook has reset expectations, making the stock interesting as a potential play on a 
 recovery. At the same time, it calls into question Louisana-Pacific's outlook, and investors must keep a close eye on both companies. Ultimately, end market prospects for both companies will largely depend on the North American housing market's state, which depends on the interest rate cycle.
Ultimately, buying into either stock implies investing with an awareness that there will likely be volatility along the way as the market debates the timing and magnitude of interest rate cuts.

Exploring Value Opportunities On The ASX In July 2024

The Australian stock market has experienced a slight decline of 1.2% over the past week, though it still shows a robust annual growth of 8.6%, with earnings expected to grow by 13% per annum. In this context, identifying undervalued stocks can offer investors potential opportunities for growth, especially when certain assets may not fully reflect their future earning capabilities in their current prices.
Let's take a closer look at a couple of our picks from the screened companies.
 James Hardie Industries plc specializes in manufacturing and selling fiber cement, fiber gypsum, and cement bonded building products for various building construction applications, primarily in the United States, Australia, Europe, New Zealand, and the Philippines, with a market capitalization of approximately A$23.40 billion.
 The company's revenue is segmented into Europe Building Products at $482.10 million, Asia Pacific Fiber Cement at $562.80 million, and North America Fiber Cement at $2.89 billion.
 21.7%
James Hardie Industries, priced at A$54.24, is currently valued below its estimated fair value of A$69.25, indicating a potential undervaluation of over 20%. Despite a high debt level, the company's Return on Equity is expected to be strong at 27.8% in three years. Earnings are projected to grow by 14% annually, outpacing the Australian market forecast of 13.5%. Recent activities include an increased equity buyback plan by A$50 million and inclusion in the S&P/ASX 20 Index.
 Lovisa Holdings Limited operates in the fashion jewelry and accessories retail sector, with a market capitalization of approximately A$3.71 billion.
 The company generates its revenue primarily from the retail sale of fashion jewelry and accessories, totaling A$653.99 million.
 33.5%
Lovisa Holdings, priced at A$33.86, trades 33.5% below its fair value of A$50.91, suggesting significant undervaluation based on cash flows. While its revenue growth at 13.4% annually surpasses the Australian market's 5.6%, it's slower than the industry benchmark of 20%. Earnings are expected to increase by 17.3% yearly, outperforming the market forecast of 13.5%. The company’s Return on Equity is projected to be very high in three years at nearly double current figures.
 SiteMinder Limited, operating globally, provides online guest acquisition platforms and commerce solutions for accommodation providers, with a market capitalization of approximately A$1.46 billion.
 The company generates its revenue primarily through software and programming services, amounting to A$171.70 million.
 44.1%
SiteMinder, with a current price of A$5.3, appears undervalued by 44.1% against a calculated fair value of A$9.49, based on discounted cash flows. The company's revenue growth is projected at 19.1% annually, outpacing the Australian market's average of 5.6%. Although this growth rate is below the industry’s top performers at 20%, SiteMinder's expected profitability within three years and a forecasted high Return on Equity of 24.5% highlight its potential for value appreciation and financial improvement following its strategic partnership with Cloudbeds announced on June 11, 2024.

Why James Hardie Shares Are Dropping Today

 
 is feeling the pressure from a difficult housing cycle. Shares of the building materials manufacturer traded down 15% as of 1 p.m. ET Tuesday following the release of the company's latest quarterly report.
James Hardie is an Australian manufacturer of 
 best known for its Hardie Board fiber-cement house siding. The company earned $0.40 in the quarter on revenue of $1 billion, or about $10 million less than the analyst consensus estimate.
For its full fiscal year ending March 31, James Hardie saw sales grow by 4%.
James Hardie's fortunes are tied closely to the 
 and renovation markets, which have cooled in the U.S. and elsewhere due to rising interest rates. The company said it expects demand from its largest market, North America, to decrease by 2% in calendar 2024 compared to 2023.
It's worth noting that the company continues to grow revenue in a tough market, implying that James Hardie is having some success outperforming overall demand and perhaps taking market share. Cement fiber is considered superior to traditional alternatives due to its durability, but it also tends to cost more to install.
The company sells into cyclical markets, and James Hardie can only do so much to offset the cycle.
With Tuesday's declines, the stock is now 25% off its high for 2024. Expectations are being reset, and with any luck, the stock doesn't have much further to fall. Investors buying in now will need to have patience as they ride out the cycle.

Amidst a generally positive trend in the Australian market, with the ASX200 closing up and most sectors showing gains, investors are keenly observing shifts in various sectors influenced by global economic signals and local corporate developments. In this context, identifying stocks that appear undervalued becomes crucial, as they may offer potential for growth especially when aligned with broader economic movements and sector-specific trends.
Here's a peek at a few of the choices from the screener.

 The company's revenue is generated from three primary segments: Europe Building Products at $482.10 million, Asia Pacific Fiber Cement at $562.80 million, and North America Fiber Cement at $2.89 billion.
