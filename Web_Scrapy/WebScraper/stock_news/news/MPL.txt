Medibank Private (ASX:MPL) Will Pay A Larger Dividend Than Last Year At A$0.083

 (
) dividend will be increasing from last year's payment of the same period to A$0.083 on 5th of October. This takes the dividend yield to 4.1%, which shareholders will be pleased with.
A big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. Before making this announcement, Medibank Private was paying out quite a large proportion of both earnings and cash flow, with the dividend being 290% of cash flows. This is certainly a risk factor, as reduced cash flows could force the company to pay a lower dividend.
EPS is set to grow by 13.4% over the next year. If recent patterns in the dividend continues, the payout ratio in 12 months could be 76% which is a bit high but can definitely be sustainable.
The dividend's track record has been pretty solid, but with only 8 years of history we want to see a few more years of history before making any solid conclusions. Since 2015, the dividend has gone from A$0.053 total annually to A$0.146. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 14% per annum over that time. It is always nice to see strong dividend growth, but with such a short payment history we wouldn't be inclined to rely on it until a longer track record can be developed.
The company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. However, Medibank Private has only grown its earnings per share at 3.8% per annum over the past five years. Medibank Private's earnings per share has barely grown, which is not ideal - perhaps this is why the company pays out the majority of its earnings to shareholders. This isn't the end of the world, but for investors looking for strong dividend growth they may want to look elsewhere.
Overall, this is probably not a great income stock, even though the dividend is being raised at the moment. The payments are bit high to be considered sustainable, and the track record isn't the best. We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.
Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. For example, we've picked out

We Ran A Stock Scan For Earnings Growth And Medibank Private (ASX:MPL) Passed With Ease

Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.
If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in 
 (
). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.
Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. It certainly is nice to see that Medibank Private has managed to grow EPS by 17% per year over three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up 
 sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.
Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. The good news is that Medibank Private is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 2.9 percentage points to 11%, over the last year.

Prior to investment, it's always a good idea to check that the management team is paid reasonably. Pay levels around or below the median, can be a sign that shareholder interests are well considered. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Medibank Private with market caps between AU$6.2b and AU$19b is about AU$3.9m.
Medibank Private offered total compensation worth AU$3.3m to its CEO in the year to June 2023. That comes in below the average for similar sized companies and seems pretty reasonable. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.
For growth investors, Medibank Private's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. The fast growth bodes well while the very reasonable CEO pay assists builds some confidence in the board. Based on these factors, this stock may well deserve a spot on your watchlist, or even a little further research. You should always think about risks though. Case in point, we've spotted

Based on Medibank Private Ltd's dividend yield and five-year growth rate, the

To assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The

Investing in Medibank Private (ASX:MPL) five years ago would have delivered you a 56% gain

Generally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the 
 (
) share price is up 26% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 18% (ignoring dividends).
So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns.
While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.
During five years of share price growth, Medibank Private achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 3.8% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 5% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.
You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).
We know that Medibank Private has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this 
 
.
It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Medibank Private the TSR over the last 5 years was 56%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!
It's nice to see that Medibank Private shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 28% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 9% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Medibank Private better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted 
 you should be aware of.

Declining Stock and Decent Financials: Is The Market Wrong About Medibank Private Limited (ASX:MPL)?

With its stock down 3.1% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard Medibank Private (ASX:MPL). However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. Specifically, we decided to study 
 ROE in this article.
Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Medibank Private is:
25% = AU$511m ÷ AU$2.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).
The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each A$1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made A$0.25 in profit.
Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or "retains" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
First thing first, we like that Medibank Private has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 9.4% which is quite remarkable. Yet, Medibank Private has posted measly growth of 2.5% over the past five years. This is interesting as the high returns should mean that the company has the ability to generate high growth but for some reason, it hasn't been able to do so. We reckon that a low growth, when returns are quite high could be the result of certain circumstances like low earnings retention or or poor allocation of capital.
As a next step, we compared Medibank Private's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 4.5% in the same period.
Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is MPL worth today? The 
 helps visualize whether MPL is currently mispriced by the market.
Medibank Private has a three-year median payout ratio of 88% (implying that it keeps only 12% of its profits), meaning that it pays out most of its profits to shareholders as dividends, and as a result, the company has seen low earnings growth.
Additionally, Medibank Private has paid dividends over a period of eight years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 83%. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that Medibank Private's future ROE will be 24% which is again, similar to the current ROE.
Overall, we feel that Medibank Private certainly does have some positive factors to consider. However, while the company does have a high ROE, its earnings growth number is quite disappointing. This can be blamed on the fact that it reinvests only a small portion of its profits and pays out the rest as dividends. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

We Take A Look At Whether Medibank Private Limited's (ASX:MPL) CEO May Be Underpaid

The solid performance at 
 (
) has been impressive and shareholders will probably be pleased to know that CEO David Koczkar has delivered. This would be kept in mind at the upcoming AGM on 22nd of November which will be a chance for them to hear the board review the financial results, discuss future company strategy and vote on resolutions such as executive remuneration and other matters. We think the CEO has done a pretty decent job and probably deserves a well-earned pay rise.
At the time of writing, our data shows that Medibank Private Limited has a market capitalization of AU$9.9b, and reported total annual CEO compensation of AU$3.3m for the year to June 2023. Notably, that's a decrease of 13% over the year before. We think total compensation is more important but our data shows that the CEO salary is lower, at AU$1.5m.
On comparing similar companies from the 
 with market caps ranging from AU$6.3b to AU$19b, we found that the median CEO total compensation was AU$6.0m. In other words, Medibank Private pays its CEO lower than the industry median. Furthermore, David Koczkar directly owns AU$5.1m worth of shares in the company, implying that they are deeply invested in the company's success.
On an industry level, roughly 52% of total compensation represents salary and 48% is other remuneration. Although there is a difference in how total compensation is set, Medibank Private more or less reflects the market in terms of setting the salary. If total compensation is slanted towards non-salary benefits, it indicates that CEO pay is linked to company performance.
Medibank Private Limited has seen its earnings per share (EPS) increase by 17% a year over the past three years. Its revenue is up 5.5% over the last year.
Overall this is a positive result for shareholders, showing that the company has improved in recent years. It's also good to see modest revenue growth, suggesting the underlying business is healthy. Historical performance can sometimes be a good indicator on what's coming up next but if you want to peer into the company's future you might be interested in 
Boasting a total shareholder return of 39% over three years, Medibank Private Limited has done well by shareholders. As a result, some may believe the CEO should be paid more than is normal for companies of similar size.
Given the company's decent performance, the CEO remuneration policy might not be shareholders' central point of focus in the AGM. Instead, investors might be more interested in discussions that would help manage their longer-term growth expectations such as company business strategies and future growth potential.
CEO compensation can have a massive impact on performance, but it's just one element. We've identified 
 that investors should be aware of in a dynamic business environment.
 Medibank Private is an exciting stock, but we understand investors may be looking for an unencumbered balance sheet and blockbuster returns. You might find something

UPDATE 3-Australia, US, UK sanction Russian hacker over Medibank breach

(Adds U.S., Britain action in paragraphs 8-9)
By Renju Jose
SYDNEY, Jan 23 (Reuters) -
Australia, the United States and Britain on Tuesday imposed cyber sanctions on a Russian man for his role in the breach at insurer Medibank, one of the country's biggest data thefts which impacted about 10 million customers.
Reports of cybercrime in Australia have spiked over recent years with several companies disclosing hacks, prompting the government last year to overhaul its cyber security rules and to set up an agency to help coordinate responses.
Targeted financial sanctions and a travel ban have been imposed on Russian citizen Aleksandr Ermakov after Australian authorities linked him to the breach at Medibank, Home Affairs Minister Clare O'Neil said during a press briefing.
"These people are cowards and they're scumbags. They hide behind technology and today, the Australian government is saying that when we put our minds to it, we'll unveil who you are, and we'll make sure you are accountable," O'Neil said.
This is the first time Australia has used its cyber sanctions framework since legislating it in 2021. The sanction makes it a criminal offence, punishable by up to 10 years in jail and fines, to provide Ermakov with any assets, including cryptocurrency wallets or ransomware payments.
The sanctions may not result in the arrest of the hacker or deter others from targeting Australian assets but the government's move "is a step in the right direction," said Nigel Phair, cybersecurity professor at the Monash University.
"It puts sand in the gears of the cyber criminals by degrading their efforts to work with others in future criminal pursuits," Phair said.
The U.S. Treasury Department on Tuesday said in a statement that Washington and Britain also imposed sanctions on Ermakov because of the risk he poses. The U.S. action freezes his U.S. assets and generally bars Americans from dealing with him.
"Today’s trilateral action with Australia and the United Kingdom, the first such coordinated action, underscores our collective resolve to hold these criminals to account," Treasury's Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Brian Nelson, said.
Medibank in 2022 disclosed that a hacker stole the personal information of 9.7 million current and former customers, and released the data on the dark web.
A government report in November said state-sponsored cyber groups and hackers had stepped up assaults on Australia's critical infrastructure, businesses and homes, with one attack every six minutes likely occurring on Australian assets.
Hackers in November hit DP World Australia, one of the country's largest ports operators, forcing it to suspend operations for three days. Victoria state authorities early this month disclosed court recordings database was breached, impacting recordings and transcription services.

Australia sanctions Russian national accused of hacking in Medibank data leak

Australia has publicly named and imposed cyber sanctions on a Russian national for his alleged role in a 
, in the country’s first use of the penalty.
The attack stole sensitive personal data from 9.7 million customers of Medibank, one of Australia’s largest private health insurers: including names, dates of births, medical information and Medicare numbers. Some of these records were published on the dark web, according to Australian authorities.
At the time, the Australian Federal Police said investigators knew the identity of the attackers but declined to name them. On Tuesday, the Australian government revealed the name of the individual sanctioned — Russian national 
, 33, an alleged member of the 
The sanctions make it a criminal offense to provide assets to Ermakov, or to use or deal with his assets, including through cryptocurrency wallets or ransomware payments, according to a 
The offense is punishable by up to 10 years’ imprisonment. The government has also imposed a travel ban on Ermakov.
Australian authorities have “worked tirelessly over the past 18 months to unmask those responsible for the cyberattack on Medibank Private,” Richard Marles, deputy prime minister and defense minister, said in the release.
The investigation included collaboration between federal intelligence agency Australian Signals Directorate, the Australian Federal Police, the FBI and National Security Agency (NSA) in the United States, and the United Kingdom’s cyber agency GCHQ — as well as with companies including Microsoft (
) and Medibank, Marles said at a news conference Tuesday.
Cybersecurity experts said at the time of the data breach that it was likely linked to REvil, which had previously launched large attacks on targets in the United States and elsewhere. One such attack on international meat supplier JBS Foods in 2021 shut down the company’s entire US beef processing operation and prompted the company to pay
At the request of the US, Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) intelligence agency detained multiple people associated with REvil in January 2022, seized millions of dollars and raided the homes of 14 people.
When the Medibank attack took place later that year, experts said it could have been perpetrated by a REvil member — which Australian authorities confirmed on Tuesday.
“REvil is only one of many Russian cyber-criminal syndicates, and those gangs we know are dynamic and have multiple partners. So a disruption of REvil at one point in time doesn’t cease its business,” Abigail Bradshaw, head of the Australian Cyber Security Center, said at the news conference.
However, she said, “cyber criminals trade in anonymity” — so publicly naming Ermakov “will most certainly do harm” to his activities, on top of the financial blow of the sanction.
Marles added that with this announcement, “his identity now being completely plain is on display for every agency around the world, but also anybody who is seeking to operate with him, so this will have a very significant impact on Aleksandr Ermakov.”
Investigations into other individuals linked to the attack are ongoing, Marles said.
The stolen data belonged to not only Australian customers but 1.8 million international customers. An initial ransom demand was made for $10 million (15 million Australian dollars). It was later lowered to $9.7 million, which Medibank refused to pay.
Australian authorities have repeatedly urged businesses and individuals not to pay ransoms to cyber criminals, arguing that paying does not guarantee the recovery of data or prevent further attacks — and makes the country a bigger target.

Here's Why We Think Medibank Private (ASX:MPL) Is Well Worth Watching

It's common for many investors, especially those who are inexperienced, to buy shares in companies with a good story even if these companies are loss-making. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.
If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in 
 (
). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it.
If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. It certainly is nice to see that Medibank Private has managed to grow EPS by 17% per year over three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up 
 sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.
Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. It's noted that Medibank Private's revenue 
 was lower than its revenue in the last twelve months, so that could distort our analysis of its margins. Medibank Private maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 5.5% to AU$7.5b. That's a real positive.

Of course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to 
.
It's a good habit to check into a company's remuneration policies to ensure that the CEO and management team aren't putting their own interests before that of the shareholder with excessive salary packages. For companies with market capitalisations between AU$6.1b and AU$18b, like Medibank Private, the median CEO pay is around AU$4.1m.
Medibank Private offered total compensation worth AU$3.3m to its CEO in the year to June 2023. That is actually below the median for CEO's of similarly sized companies. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when it's reasonable, that gives a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making.
You can't deny that Medibank Private has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. With swiftly growing earnings, the best days may still be to come, and the modest CEO pay suggests the company is careful with cash. We think that based on its merits alone, this stock is worth watching into the future. Even so, be aware that

Medibank Private Limited (ASX:MPL) Passed Our Checks, And It's About To Pay A AU$0.072 Dividend

Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see 
 (
) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Medibank Private's shares before the 29th of February to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 20th of March.
The company's next dividend payment will be AU$0.072 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of AU$0.15 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Medibank Private stock has a trailing yield of around 4.0% on the current share price of AU$3.63. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to investigate whether Medibank Private can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow.
Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Medibank Private paid out more than half (62%) of its earnings last year, which is a regular payout ratio for most companies.
When a company paid out less in dividends than it earned in profit, this generally suggests its dividend is affordable. The lower the % of its profit that it pays out, the greater the margin of safety for the dividend if the business enters a downturn.
Click 
Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. For this reason, we're glad to see Medibank Private's earnings per share have risen 10% per annum over the last five years.
Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the last nine years, Medibank Private has lifted its dividend by approximately 12% a year on average. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years.
Is Medibank Private worth buying for its dividend? Medibank Private has an acceptable payout ratio and its earnings per share have been improving at a decent rate. Overall, Medibank Private looks like a promising dividend stock in this analysis, and we think it would be worth investigating further.
With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces.

Has Medibank Private Limited (ASX:MPL) Stock's Recent Performance Got Anything to Do With Its Financial Health?

Medibank Private's (ASX:MPL) stock up by 5.1% over the past three months. As most would know, long-term fundamentals have a strong correlation with market price movements, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. Particularly, we will be paying attention to 
 ROE today.
Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Medibank Private is:
29% = AU$685m ÷ AU$2.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).
The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every A$1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of A$0.29.
We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or "retain", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
First thing first, we like that Medibank Private has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 13% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. Probably as a result of this, Medibank Private was able to see a decent net income growth of 7.3% over the last five years.
Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Medibank Private's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 12% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see.
The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for MPL? You can find out in
The high three-year median payout ratio of 85% (or a retention ratio of 15%) for Medibank Private suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of its income to its shareholders.
Additionally, Medibank Private has paid dividends over a period of nine years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 83%. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that Medibank Private's future ROE will be 24% which is again, similar to the current ROE.
On the whole, we do feel that Medibank Private has some positive attributes. Its earnings have grown respectably as we saw earlier, which was likely due to the company reinvesting its earnings at a pretty high rate of return. However, given the high ROE, we do think that the company is reinvesting a small portion of its profits. This could likely be preventing the company from growing to its full extent. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

Medibank Private's (ASX:MPL) earnings growth rate lags the 9.2% CAGR delivered to shareholders

When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average. Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, the 
 (
) share price is up 25% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 20% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 3.8% in the last year , including dividends .
In light of the stock dropping 4.0% in the past week, we want to investigate the longer term story, and see if fundamentals have been the driver of the company's positive five-year return.
To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).
Over half a decade, Medibank Private managed to grow its earnings per share at 13% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 5% over the same period. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.

It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Medibank Private, it has a TSR of 55% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!
Medibank Private shareholders gained a total return of 3.8% during the year. But that was short of the market average. On the bright side, the longer term returns (running at about 9% a year, over half a decade) look better. It may well be that this is a business worth popping on the watching, given the continuing positive reception, over time, from the market. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Medibank Private better, we need to consider many other factors.

Medibank Private (ASX:MPL) Has Announced A Dividend Of A$0.072

The board of 
 (
) has announced that it will pay a dividend on the 20th of March, with investors receiving A$0.072 per share. This makes the dividend yield 4.0%, which is above the industry average.
A big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. Prior to this announcement, Medibank Private's dividend was only 62% of earnings, however it was paying out 127% of free cash flows. This signals that the company is more focused on returning cash flow to shareholders, but it could mean that the dividend is exposed to cuts in the future.
Over the next year, EPS is forecast to fall by 11.3%. However, if the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio could reach 76%, meaning that most of the company's earnings are being paid out to shareholders.
It is great to see that Medibank Private has been paying a stable dividend for a number of years now, however we want to be a bit cautious about whether this will remain true through a full economic cycle. Since 2015, the annual payment back then was A$0.053, compared to the most recent full-year payment of A$0.146. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 12% per annum over that time. It is always nice to see strong dividend growth, but with such a short payment history we wouldn't be inclined to rely on it until a longer track record can be developed.
Investors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. We are encouraged to see that Medibank Private has grown earnings per share at 13% per year over the past five years. The company is paying out a lot of its cash as a dividend, but it looks okay based on the payout ratio.
In summary, while it's always good to see the dividend being raised, we don't think Medibank Private's payments are rock solid. While Medibank Private is earning enough to cover the payments, the cash flows are lacking. We don't think Medibank Private is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.
It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. To that end, Medibank Private has

Here's Why We Think Medibank Private (ASX:MPL) Might Deserve Your Attention Today

The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.
Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like 
 (
). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Medibank Private with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.
If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Shareholders will be happy to know that Medibank Private's EPS has grown 24% each year, compound, over three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up 
 sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.
One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. The good news is that Medibank Private is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 5.6 percentage points to 12%, over the last year. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.

It's said that there's no smoke without fire. For investors, insider buying is often the smoke that indicates which stocks could set the market alight. Because often, the purchase of stock is a sign that the buyer views it as undervalued. Of course, we can never be sure what insiders are thinking, we can only judge their actions.
It's nice to see that there have been no reports of any insiders selling shares in Medibank Private in the previous 12 months. With that in mind, it's heartening that Linda Nicholls, the Independent Non-Executive Director of the company, paid AU$20k for shares at around AU$3.65 each. Purchases like this can help the investors understand the views of the management team; in which case they see some potential in Medibank Private.
It's commendable to see that insiders have been buying shares in Medibank Private, but there is more evidence of shareholder friendly management. Namely, Medibank Private has a very reasonable level of CEO pay. For companies with market capitalisations between AU$5.9b and AU$18b, like Medibank Private, the median CEO pay is around AU$4.0m.
Medibank Private offered total compensation worth AU$3.3m to its CEO in the year to June 2023. That is actually below the median for CEO's of similarly sized companies. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.
You can't deny that Medibank Private has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. But wait, it gets

We Ran A Stock Scan For Earnings Growth And Medibank Private (ASX:MPL) Passed With Ease

Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.
If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in 
 (
). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.
Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. It certainly is nice to see that Medibank Private has managed to grow EPS by 17% per year over three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up 
 sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.
Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. The good news is that Medibank Private is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 2.9 percentage points to 11%, over the last year.

Prior to investment, it's always a good idea to check that the management team is paid reasonably. Pay levels around or below the median, can be a sign that shareholder interests are well considered. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Medibank Private with market caps between AU$6.2b and AU$19b is about AU$3.9m.
Medibank Private offered total compensation worth AU$3.3m to its CEO in the year to June 2023. That comes in below the average for similar sized companies and seems pretty reasonable. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.
For growth investors, Medibank Private's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. The fast growth bodes well while the very reasonable CEO pay assists builds some confidence in the board. Based on these factors, this stock may well deserve a spot on your watchlist, or even a little further research. You should always think about risks though. Case in point, we've spotted

Medibank Private (ASX:MPL) Will Pay A Larger Dividend Than Last Year At A$0.083

 (
) dividend will be increasing from last year's payment of the same period to A$0.083 on 5th of October. This takes the dividend yield to 4.1%, which shareholders will be pleased with.
A big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. Before making this announcement, Medibank Private was paying out quite a large proportion of both earnings and cash flow, with the dividend being 290% of cash flows. This is certainly a risk factor, as reduced cash flows could force the company to pay a lower dividend.
EPS is set to grow by 13.4% over the next year. If recent patterns in the dividend continues, the payout ratio in 12 months could be 76% which is a bit high but can definitely be sustainable.
The dividend's track record has been pretty solid, but with only 8 years of history we want to see a few more years of history before making any solid conclusions. Since 2015, the dividend has gone from A$0.053 total annually to A$0.146. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 14% per annum over that time. It is always nice to see strong dividend growth, but with such a short payment history we wouldn't be inclined to rely on it until a longer track record can be developed.
The company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. However, Medibank Private has only grown its earnings per share at 3.8% per annum over the past five years. Medibank Private's earnings per share has barely grown, which is not ideal - perhaps this is why the company pays out the majority of its earnings to shareholders. This isn't the end of the world, but for investors looking for strong dividend growth they may want to look elsewhere.
Overall, this is probably not a great income stock, even though the dividend is being raised at the moment. The payments are bit high to be considered sustainable, and the track record isn't the best. We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.
Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. For example, we've picked out

Declining Stock and Decent Financials: Is The Market Wrong About Medibank Private Limited (ASX:MPL)?

With its stock down 3.1% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard Medibank Private (ASX:MPL). However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. Specifically, we decided to study 
 ROE in this article.
Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Medibank Private is:
25% = AU$511m ÷ AU$2.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).
The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each A$1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made A$0.25 in profit.
Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or "retains" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
First thing first, we like that Medibank Private has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 9.4% which is quite remarkable. Yet, Medibank Private has posted measly growth of 2.5% over the past five years. This is interesting as the high returns should mean that the company has the ability to generate high growth but for some reason, it hasn't been able to do so. We reckon that a low growth, when returns are quite high could be the result of certain circumstances like low earnings retention or or poor allocation of capital.
As a next step, we compared Medibank Private's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 4.5% in the same period.
Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is MPL worth today? The 
 helps visualize whether MPL is currently mispriced by the market.
Medibank Private has a three-year median payout ratio of 88% (implying that it keeps only 12% of its profits), meaning that it pays out most of its profits to shareholders as dividends, and as a result, the company has seen low earnings growth.
Additionally, Medibank Private has paid dividends over a period of eight years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 83%. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that Medibank Private's future ROE will be 24% which is again, similar to the current ROE.
Overall, we feel that Medibank Private certainly does have some positive factors to consider. However, while the company does have a high ROE, its earnings growth number is quite disappointing. This can be blamed on the fact that it reinvests only a small portion of its profits and pays out the rest as dividends. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

UPDATE 3-Australia, US, UK sanction Russian hacker over Medibank breach

(Adds U.S., Britain action in paragraphs 8-9)
By Renju Jose
SYDNEY, Jan 23 (Reuters) -
Australia, the United States and Britain on Tuesday imposed cyber sanctions on a Russian man for his role in the breach at insurer Medibank, one of the country's biggest data thefts which impacted about 10 million customers.
Reports of cybercrime in Australia have spiked over recent years with several companies disclosing hacks, prompting the government last year to overhaul its cyber security rules and to set up an agency to help coordinate responses.
Targeted financial sanctions and a travel ban have been imposed on Russian citizen Aleksandr Ermakov after Australian authorities linked him to the breach at Medibank, Home Affairs Minister Clare O'Neil said during a press briefing.
"These people are cowards and they're scumbags. They hide behind technology and today, the Australian government is saying that when we put our minds to it, we'll unveil who you are, and we'll make sure you are accountable," O'Neil said.
This is the first time Australia has used its cyber sanctions framework since legislating it in 2021. The sanction makes it a criminal offence, punishable by up to 10 years in jail and fines, to provide Ermakov with any assets, including cryptocurrency wallets or ransomware payments.
The sanctions may not result in the arrest of the hacker or deter others from targeting Australian assets but the government's move "is a step in the right direction," said Nigel Phair, cybersecurity professor at the Monash University.
"It puts sand in the gears of the cyber criminals by degrading their efforts to work with others in future criminal pursuits," Phair said.
The U.S. Treasury Department on Tuesday said in a statement that Washington and Britain also imposed sanctions on Ermakov because of the risk he poses. The U.S. action freezes his U.S. assets and generally bars Americans from dealing with him.
"Today’s trilateral action with Australia and the United Kingdom, the first such coordinated action, underscores our collective resolve to hold these criminals to account," Treasury's Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Brian Nelson, said.
Medibank in 2022 disclosed that a hacker stole the personal information of 9.7 million current and former customers, and released the data on the dark web.
A government report in November said state-sponsored cyber groups and hackers had stepped up assaults on Australia's critical infrastructure, businesses and homes, with one attack every six minutes likely occurring on Australian assets.
Hackers in November hit DP World Australia, one of the country's largest ports operators, forcing it to suspend operations for three days. Victoria state authorities early this month disclosed court recordings database was breached, impacting recordings and transcription services.

Here's Why We Think Medibank Private (ASX:MPL) Is Well Worth Watching

It's common for many investors, especially those who are inexperienced, to buy shares in companies with a good story even if these companies are loss-making. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.
If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in 
 (
). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it.
If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. It certainly is nice to see that Medibank Private has managed to grow EPS by 17% per year over three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up 
 sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.
Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. It's noted that Medibank Private's revenue 
 was lower than its revenue in the last twelve months, so that could distort our analysis of its margins. Medibank Private maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 5.5% to AU$7.5b. That's a real positive.

Of course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to 
.
It's a good habit to check into a company's remuneration policies to ensure that the CEO and management team aren't putting their own interests before that of the shareholder with excessive salary packages. For companies with market capitalisations between AU$6.1b and AU$18b, like Medibank Private, the median CEO pay is around AU$4.1m.
Medibank Private offered total compensation worth AU$3.3m to its CEO in the year to June 2023. That is actually below the median for CEO's of similarly sized companies. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when it's reasonable, that gives a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making.
You can't deny that Medibank Private has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. With swiftly growing earnings, the best days may still be to come, and the modest CEO pay suggests the company is careful with cash. We think that based on its merits alone, this stock is worth watching into the future. Even so, be aware that

While opting for stocks without growing earnings and absent insider buying can yield results, for investors valuing these key metrics, here is

We Take A Look At Whether Medibank Private Limited's (ASX:MPL) CEO May Be Underpaid

The solid performance at 
 (
) has been impressive and shareholders will probably be pleased to know that CEO David Koczkar has delivered. This would be kept in mind at the upcoming AGM on 22nd of November which will be a chance for them to hear the board review the financial results, discuss future company strategy and vote on resolutions such as executive remuneration and other matters. We think the CEO has done a pretty decent job and probably deserves a well-earned pay rise.
At the time of writing, our data shows that Medibank Private Limited has a market capitalization of AU$9.9b, and reported total annual CEO compensation of AU$3.3m for the year to June 2023. Notably, that's a decrease of 13% over the year before. We think total compensation is more important but our data shows that the CEO salary is lower, at AU$1.5m.
On comparing similar companies from the 
 with market caps ranging from AU$6.3b to AU$19b, we found that the median CEO total compensation was AU$6.0m. In other words, Medibank Private pays its CEO lower than the industry median. Furthermore, David Koczkar directly owns AU$5.1m worth of shares in the company, implying that they are deeply invested in the company's success.
On an industry level, roughly 52% of total compensation represents salary and 48% is other remuneration. Although there is a difference in how total compensation is set, Medibank Private more or less reflects the market in terms of setting the salary. If total compensation is slanted towards non-salary benefits, it indicates that CEO pay is linked to company performance.
Medibank Private Limited has seen its earnings per share (EPS) increase by 17% a year over the past three years. Its revenue is up 5.5% over the last year.
Overall this is a positive result for shareholders, showing that the company has improved in recent years. It's also good to see modest revenue growth, suggesting the underlying business is healthy. Historical performance can sometimes be a good indicator on what's coming up next but if you want to peer into the company's future you might be interested in 
Boasting a total shareholder return of 39% over three years, Medibank Private Limited has done well by shareholders. As a result, some may believe the CEO should be paid more than is normal for companies of similar size.
Given the company's decent performance, the CEO remuneration policy might not be shareholders' central point of focus in the AGM. Instead, investors might be more interested in discussions that would help manage their longer-term growth expectations such as company business strategies and future growth potential.
CEO compensation can have a massive impact on performance, but it's just one element. We've identified 
 that investors should be aware of in a dynamic business environment.
 Medibank Private is an exciting stock, but we understand investors may be looking for an unencumbered balance sheet and blockbuster returns. You might find something

, in the country’s first use of the penalty.
The attack stole sensitive personal data from 9.7 million customers of Medibank, one of Australia’s largest private health insurers: including names, dates of births, medical information and Medicare numbers. Some of these records were published on the dark web, according to Australian authorities.
At the time, the Australian Federal Police said investigators knew the identity of the attackers but declined to name them. On Tuesday, the Australian government revealed the name of the individual sanctioned — Russian national 
, 33, an alleged member of the 
The sanctions make it a criminal offense to provide assets to Ermakov, or to use or deal with his assets, including through cryptocurrency wallets or ransomware payments, according to a 
The offense is punishable by up to 10 years’ imprisonment. The government has also imposed a travel ban on Ermakov.
Australian authorities have “worked tirelessly over the past 18 months to unmask those responsible for the cyberattack on Medibank Private,” Richard Marles, deputy prime minister and defense minister, said in the release.
The investigation included collaboration between federal intelligence agency Australian Signals Directorate, the Australian Federal Police, the FBI and National Security Agency (NSA) in the United States, and the United Kingdom’s cyber agency GCHQ — as well as with companies including Microsoft (
) and Medibank, Marles said at a news conference Tuesday.
Cybersecurity experts said at the time of the data breach that it was likely linked to REvil, which had previously launched large attacks on targets in the United States and elsewhere. One such attack on international meat supplier JBS Foods in 2021 shut down the company’s entire US beef processing operation and prompted the company to pay
At the request of the US, Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) intelligence agency detained multiple people associated with REvil in January 2022, seized millions of dollars and raided the homes of 14 people.
When the Medibank attack took place later that year, experts said it could have been perpetrated by a REvil member — which Australian authorities confirmed on Tuesday.
“REvil is only one of many Russian cyber-criminal syndicates, and those gangs we know are dynamic and have multiple partners. So a disruption of REvil at one point in time doesn’t cease its business,” Abigail Bradshaw, head of the Australian Cyber Security Center, said at the news conference.
However, she said, “cyber criminals trade in anonymity” — so publicly naming Ermakov “will most certainly do harm” to his activities, on top of the financial blow of the sanction.
Marles added that with this announcement, “his identity now being completely plain is on display for every agency around the world, but also anybody who is seeking to operate with him, so this will have a very significant impact on Aleksandr Ermakov.”
Investigations into other individuals linked to the attack are ongoing, Marles said.
The stolen data belonged to not only Australian customers but 1.8 million international customers. An initial ransom demand was made for $10 million (15 million Australian dollars). It was later lowered to $9.7 million, which Medibank refused to pay.
Australian authorities have repeatedly urged businesses and individuals not to pay ransoms to cyber criminals, arguing that paying does not guarantee the recovery of data or prevent further attacks — and makes the country a bigger target.

Investing in Medibank Private (ASX:MPL) five years ago would have delivered you a 56% gain

Generally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the 
 (
) share price is up 26% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 18% (ignoring dividends).
So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns.
While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.
During five years of share price growth, Medibank Private achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 3.8% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 5% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.
You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).
We know that Medibank Private has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this 
 
.
It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Medibank Private the TSR over the last 5 years was 56%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!
It's nice to see that Medibank Private shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 28% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 9% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Medibank Private better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted

We will like Medibank Private better if we see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this

Medibank Private Limited (ASX:MPL) Passed Our Checks, And It's About To Pay A AU$0.072 Dividend

Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see 
 (
) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Medibank Private's shares before the 29th of February to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 20th of March.
The company's next dividend payment will be AU$0.072 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of AU$0.15 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Medibank Private stock has a trailing yield of around 4.0% on the current share price of AU$3.63. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to investigate whether Medibank Private can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow.
Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Medibank Private paid out more than half (62%) of its earnings last year, which is a regular payout ratio for most companies.
When a company paid out less in dividends than it earned in profit, this generally suggests its dividend is affordable. The lower the % of its profit that it pays out, the greater the margin of safety for the dividend if the business enters a downturn.
Click 
Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. For this reason, we're glad to see Medibank Private's earnings per share have risen 10% per annum over the last five years.
Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the last nine years, Medibank Private has lifted its dividend by approximately 12% a year on average. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years.
Is Medibank Private worth buying for its dividend? Medibank Private has an acceptable payout ratio and its earnings per share have been improving at a decent rate. Overall, Medibank Private looks like a promising dividend stock in this analysis, and we think it would be worth investigating further.
With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. 
, and understanding them should be part of your investment process.

Medibank Private (ASX:MPL) Has Announced A Dividend Of A$0.072

The board of 
 (
) has announced that it will pay a dividend on the 20th of March, with investors receiving A$0.072 per share. This makes the dividend yield 4.0%, which is above the industry average.
A big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. Prior to this announcement, Medibank Private's dividend was only 62% of earnings, however it was paying out 127% of free cash flows. This signals that the company is more focused on returning cash flow to shareholders, but it could mean that the dividend is exposed to cuts in the future.
Over the next year, EPS is forecast to fall by 11.3%. However, if the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio could reach 76%, meaning that most of the company's earnings are being paid out to shareholders.
It is great to see that Medibank Private has been paying a stable dividend for a number of years now, however we want to be a bit cautious about whether this will remain true through a full economic cycle. Since 2015, the annual payment back then was A$0.053, compared to the most recent full-year payment of A$0.146. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 12% per annum over that time. It is always nice to see strong dividend growth, but with such a short payment history we wouldn't be inclined to rely on it until a longer track record can be developed.
Investors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. We are encouraged to see that Medibank Private has grown earnings per share at 13% per year over the past five years. The company is paying out a lot of its cash as a dividend, but it looks okay based on the payout ratio.
In summary, while it's always good to see the dividend being raised, we don't think Medibank Private's payments are rock solid. While Medibank Private is earning enough to cover the payments, the cash flows are lacking. We don't think Medibank Private is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.
It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. To that end, Medibank Private has

Has Medibank Private Limited (ASX:MPL) Stock's Recent Performance Got Anything to Do With Its Financial Health?

Medibank Private's (ASX:MPL) stock up by 5.1% over the past three months. As most would know, long-term fundamentals have a strong correlation with market price movements, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. Particularly, we will be paying attention to 
 ROE today.
Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Medibank Private is:
29% = AU$685m ÷ AU$2.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).
The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every A$1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of A$0.29.
We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or "retain", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
First thing first, we like that Medibank Private has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 13% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. Probably as a result of this, Medibank Private was able to see a decent net income growth of 7.3% over the last five years.
Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Medibank Private's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 12% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see.
The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for MPL? You can find out in
The high three-year median payout ratio of 85% (or a retention ratio of 15%) for Medibank Private suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of its income to its shareholders.
Additionally, Medibank Private has paid dividends over a period of nine years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 83%. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that Medibank Private's future ROE will be 24% which is again, similar to the current ROE.
On the whole, we do feel that Medibank Private has some positive attributes. Its earnings have grown respectably as we saw earlier, which was likely due to the company reinvesting its earnings at a pretty high rate of return. However, given the high ROE, we do think that the company is reinvesting a small portion of its profits. This could likely be preventing the company from growing to its full extent. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

Here's Why We Think Medibank Private (ASX:MPL) Might Deserve Your Attention Today

The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.
Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like 
 (
). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Medibank Private with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.
If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Shareholders will be happy to know that Medibank Private's EPS has grown 24% each year, compound, over three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up 
 sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.
One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. The good news is that Medibank Private is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 5.6 percentage points to 12%, over the last year. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.

It's said that there's no smoke without fire. For investors, insider buying is often the smoke that indicates which stocks could set the market alight. Because often, the purchase of stock is a sign that the buyer views it as undervalued. Of course, we can never be sure what insiders are thinking, we can only judge their actions.
It's nice to see that there have been no reports of any insiders selling shares in Medibank Private in the previous 12 months. With that in mind, it's heartening that Linda Nicholls, the Independent Non-Executive Director of the company, paid AU$20k for shares at around AU$3.65 each. Purchases like this can help the investors understand the views of the management team; in which case they see some potential in Medibank Private.
It's commendable to see that insiders have been buying shares in Medibank Private, but there is more evidence of shareholder friendly management. Namely, Medibank Private has a very reasonable level of CEO pay. For companies with market capitalisations between AU$5.9b and AU$18b, like Medibank Private, the median CEO pay is around AU$4.0m.
Medibank Private offered total compensation worth AU$3.3m to its CEO in the year to June 2023. That is actually below the median for CEO's of similarly sized companies. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.
You can't deny that Medibank Private has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. But wait, it gets

Medibank Private's (ASX:MPL) earnings growth rate lags the 9.2% CAGR delivered to shareholders

When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average. Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, the 
 (
) share price is up 25% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 20% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 3.8% in the last year , including dividends .
In light of the stock dropping 4.0% in the past week, we want to investigate the longer term story, and see if fundamentals have been the driver of the company's positive five-year return.
To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).
Over half a decade, Medibank Private managed to grow its earnings per share at 13% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 5% over the same period. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.

It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Medibank Private, it has a TSR of 55% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!
Medibank Private shareholders gained a total return of 3.8% during the year. But that was short of the market average. On the bright side, the longer term returns (running at about 9% a year, over half a decade) look better. It may well be that this is a business worth popping on the watching, given the continuing positive reception, over time, from the market. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Medibank Private better, we need to consider many other factors.
