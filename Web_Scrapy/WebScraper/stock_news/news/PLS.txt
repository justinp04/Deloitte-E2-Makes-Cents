Pilbara Minerals Limited (ASX:PLS) Analysts Are Reducing Their Forecasts For This Year

One thing we could say about the analysts on 
 (
) - they aren't optimistic, having just made a major negative revision to their near-term (statutory) forecasts for the organization. Both revenue and earnings per share (EPS) estimates were cut sharply as analysts factored in the latest outlook for the business, concluding that they were too optimistic previously.
Following the downgrade, the consensus from 15 analysts covering Pilbara Minerals is for revenues of AU$2.1b in 2024, implying a substantial 48% decline in sales compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are anticipated to plummet 58% to AU$0.33 in the same period. Before this latest update, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of AU$2.4b and earnings per share (EPS) of AU$0.38 in 2024. Indeed, we can see that the analysts are a lot more bearish about Pilbara Minerals' prospects, administering a measurable cut to revenue estimates and slashing their EPS estimates to boot.
Despite the cuts to forecast earnings, there was no real change to the AU$4.66 price target, showing that the analysts don't think the changes have a meaningful impact on its intrinsic value.
One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. We would highlight that sales are expected to reverse, with a forecast 48% annualised revenue decline to the end of 2024. That is a notable change from historical growth of 82% over the last five years. Compare this with our data, which suggests that other companies in the same industry are, in aggregate, expected to see their revenue grow 2.3% per year. So although its revenues are forecast to shrink, this cloud does not come with a silver lining - Pilbara Minerals is expected to lag the wider industry.
The most important thing to take away is that analysts cut their earnings per share estimates, expecting a clear decline in business conditions. Regrettably, they also downgraded their revenue estimates, and the latest forecasts imply the business will grow sales slower than the wider market. The lack of change in the price target is puzzling in light of the downgrade but, with a serious decline expected this year, we wouldn't be surprised if investors were a bit wary of Pilbara Minerals.
With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for Pilbara Minerals going out to 2026, and you can

Despite shrinking by AU$1.1b in the past week, Pilbara Minerals (ASX:PLS) shareholders are still up 982% over 3 years

While 
 (
) shareholders are probably generally happy, the stock hasn't had particularly good run recently, with the share price falling 21% in the last quarter. But over the last three years the stock has shone bright like a diamond. The longer term view reveals that the share price is up 853% in that period. So you might argue that the recent reduction in the share price is unremarkable in light of the longer term performance. The share price action could signify that the business itself is dramatically improved, in that time. Anyone who held for that rewarding ride would probably be keen to talk about it.
Since the long term performance has been good but there's been a recent pullback of 8.3%, let's check if the fundamentals match the share price.
In his essay 
 Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.
During three years of share price growth, Pilbara Minerals moved from a loss to profitability. Given the importance of this milestone, it's not overly surprising that the share price has increased strongly.
The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).
It is of course excellent to see how Pilbara Minerals has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. Take a more thorough look at Pilbara Minerals' financial health with this 
 
.
It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Pilbara Minerals' TSR for the last 3 years was 982%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!
Pilbara Minerals shareholders are down 18% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 7.6%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 42%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 
 (of which 1 can't be ignored!) you should know about.

Lithium producers stay bullish on EVs despite growing headwinds

By Ernest Scheyder and Melanie Burton
(Reuters) - The world's largest lithium producers say they remain bullish on long-term demand for the battery material in the midst of recent price drops fueled by growing worries that the global pace of electric vehicle adoption is slowing.
LG Energy Solution, General Motors, Honda and other auto and battery makers have trimmed EV expansion plans in recent weeks, partly due to rising interest rates, which in turn has stoked concerns of a supply glut for the battery metal.
A basket of prices for lithium - which vary by region and by type - tracked by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence has dropped more than 60% this year.
While demand for the ultralight battery metal is still expected to rise this year from 2022 levels, investors' expectations for white-hot industry growth were dampened by sluggish quarterly reports from Albemarle, Pilbara Minerals, Livent and others.
In Australia, the world's largest lithium-producing nation, Pilbara Minerals is the most-shorted stock on the Australian Stock Exchange, suggesting investors have a negative view on lithium demand.
The bearish sentiment has affected more than just lithium producers. Lithium Royalty Corp, a lithium investor, has lost more than 37% of its value since listing in Toronto earlier this year. The Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF has dropped 18% this year.
Chris Berry, an independent lithium analyst and consultant, advises clients to focus on a range of prices for the key battery metal, not just spot, adding that prices today remain far above historical trends.
"While the spot price has cratered, I haven't seen an evaporating of demand which would validate the trajectory of the spot price," Berry said.
In calls with investors and analysts in recent days, lithium producers said they saw the market volatility as short term, adding that they expect electrification to keep growing.
"We see what's happening now as road bumps, but certainly not a determinant for the long-term growth we have," Eric Norris, head of Albemarle's Energy Storage division, told investors on Thursday after the company cut its annual forecast and reported disappointing quarterly results.
Livent, which supplies BMW and Tesla said it continues to expect strong lithium sales despite its own weak results. "We see (lithium) supply continuing to be the constraint on demand," said Livent CEO Paul Graves.
Pilbara last week flagged a "softening market backdrop" and ruled out share buybacks or special dividends for shareholders. Still, executives said that decision was born from a desire to be cautious for the time being.
"Demand is absolutely there," said Pilbara CEO Dale Henderson. "It's just a case of moderating pricing. It's still a very healthy market."
Mineral Resources, which operates lithium mines with Albemarle and Jiangxi Ganfeng Lithium, described the market's current state as a "rebalancing" of supply chains.
And IGO, which holds a stake in a joint venture that controls Greenbushes, the world's largest lithium mine, warned of ongoing market volatility earlier this week, but added it believed the industry's troubles were only "near term".

Pilbara Minerals Limited (ASX:PLS) most popular amongst individual investors who own 44% of the shares, institutions hold 43%

A look at the shareholders of Pilbara Minerals Limited (
) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that individual investors own the lion's share in the company with 44% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
Institutions, on the other hand, account for 43% of the company's stockholders. Institutions often own shares in more established companies, while it's not unusual to see insiders own a fair bit of smaller companies.
Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Pilbara Minerals.
Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.
Pilbara Minerals already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Pilbara Minerals' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.
We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Pilbara Minerals. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is State Street Global Advisors, Inc. with 9.9% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 6.3% and 5.7% of the stock.
A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 17 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.
While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.
Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.
Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Pilbara Minerals Limited. It's a big company, so even a small proportional interest can create alignment between the board and shareholders. In this case insiders own AU$72m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking 
The general public-- including retail investors -- own 44% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.
Public companies currently own 13% of Pilbara Minerals stock. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.
It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Pilbara Minerals better, we need to consider many other factors. Be aware that 
, and 1 of those doesn't sit too well with us...

Estimating The Intrinsic Value Of Pilbara Minerals Limited (ASX:PLS)

Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Pilbara Minerals Limited (ASX:PLS) as an investment opportunity by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!
We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the 
.
We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:
 = AU$4.8b
After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.5%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$974m× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.5%– 2.1%) = AU$18b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$18b÷ ( 1 + 7.5%)
= AU$8.9b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is AU$14b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of AU$4.0, the company appears about fair value at a 13% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.
The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Pilbara Minerals as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.087. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to "what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For Pilbara Minerals, we've put together three essential factors you should explore:

These Analysts Just Made A Meaningful Downgrade To Their Pilbara Minerals Limited (ASX:PLS) EPS Forecasts

Market forces rained on the parade of 
 (
) shareholders today, when the analysts downgraded their forecasts for this year. Both revenue and earnings per share (EPS) forecasts went under the knife, suggesting the analysts have soured majorly on the business.
Following the downgrade, the consensus from 17 analysts covering Pilbara Minerals is for revenues of AU$1.4b in 2024, implying a stressful 65% decline in sales compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are supposed to plunge 78% to AU$0.17 in the same period. Before this latest update, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of AU$1.6b and earnings per share (EPS) of AU$0.22 in 2024. It looks like analyst sentiment has declined substantially, with a substantial drop in revenue estimates and a pretty serious decline to earnings per share numbers as well.
Despite the cuts to forecast earnings, there was no real change to the AU$3.78 price target, showing that the analysts don't think the changes have a meaningful impact on its intrinsic value.
Of course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. These estimates imply that sales are expected to slow, with a forecast annualised revenue decline of 65% by the end of 2024. This indicates a significant reduction from annual growth of 82% over the last five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the same industry are forecast to see their revenue grow 2.2% annually for the foreseeable future. So although its revenues are forecast to shrink, this cloud does not come with a silver lining - Pilbara Minerals is expected to lag the wider industry.
The biggest issue in the new estimates is that analysts have reduced their earnings per share estimates, suggesting business headwinds lay ahead for Pilbara Minerals. Regrettably, they also downgraded their revenue estimates, and the latest forecasts imply the business will grow sales slower than the wider market. We're also surprised to see that the price target went unchanged. Still, deteriorating business conditions (assuming accurate forecasts!) can be a leading indicator for the stock price, so we wouldn't blame investors for being more cautious on Pilbara Minerals after the downgrade.
Still, the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for Pilbara Minerals going out to 2026, and you can

Pilbara Minerals' Q2 revenue halves, focuses on cutting costs

Australia's Pilbara Minerals reported a 46% sequential drop in its second-quarter revenue on Wednesday as average realised price for spodumene halved, and lowered annual capital expenditure guidance.
Australian lithium producers may be set to track the nickel industry in project curtailments and delays this reporting season, analysts say, given slower-than-expected electric vehicle (EV) sales that have hit prices but the jolt is expected to be less severe.
"Market pricing for spodumene concentrate and lithium chemicals is expected to remain volatile in the near-term given uncertain macroeconomic conditions," Pilbara said.
The company said it is focusing on cutting costs to preserve its cash and was going ahead with expansion plans to create intermediate products which it can fund from its reserves.
The company cut its fiscal 2024 capital expenditure forecast to A$820 million-$875 million from A$875 million-A$975 million.
"With confidence in the long-term outlook, the Group is continuing with its previously announced strategy of prioritising investment in expanding production through the P680 and P1000 Projects," the company added
This will yield both increased production capacity and result in scale benefits such as reduced unit costs to strengthen the profitability of the operation, it added.
Pilbara posted revenue of A$264 million ($173.71 million) for the quarter ended December 31, down from A$493 million in the previous quarter.

UPDATE 2-AustralianSuper ups stakes in Pilbara Minerals, Endeavour Group

(Adds AustralianSuper's response)
Jan 9 (Reuters) - Pension fund AustralianSuper has raised its stake in lithium miner Pilbara Minerals and alcohol retailer Endeavour Group, two separate exchange filings showed on Tuesday.
The stake increase makes AustralianSuper the largest stakeholder in Pilbara with a 6.1% interest, overtaking a Ganfeng Lithium Group subsidiary, which owns 5.74%, according to LSEG data.
AustralianSuper maintained its position as the third-largest shareholder in Endeavour, building its stake up to 8.8% from 7.65%.
The country's largest pension fund, which manages over A$300 billion ($201.27 billion) of retirement savings, declined to comment on the stake increases.
AustralianSuper has, in the last few months, shifted its attitude towards investing in some of the country's largest companies, and is now actively scooping up stakes in blue-chip firms to give itself more leverage and control on strategy.
It bought Pilbara shares worth A$558 million in November last year, at a time when domestic lithium miners were being closely watched by global players as acquisition targets.
Endeavour, the country's biggest pub owner, is going through a board shake-up with Chair Peter Hearl resigning after a period of disagreement with top shareholder and billionaire publican Bruce Mathieson.
Pilbara and Endeavour did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comments.

Australia's lithium producers see signs market is stabilising

MELBOURNE, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Pilbara Minerals said on Thursday it saw signs the lithium market was stabilising as Australia's top producers reported a slump in earnings and took steps to ride out slowing demand for the raw material of electric vehicle batteries.
Lithium prices have fallen around 70% over the past year as EV sales growth slowed, but capacity expansions by chemicals makers and government support globally bode well for the market longer term, Pilbara Minerals CEO Dale Henderson said.
In the short term, prices of lithium ore spodumene appear to have levelled out, with a small increase in China's lithium carbonate prices and more customer enquiries over the last eight weeks than in "quite some period", Henderson told an earnings call.
Top battery maker CATL's closure of its high cost Jianxiawo lepidolite operations would be a positive sign for the market, he said. Australian lithium stocks gained early this week after Reuters reported speculation about the closure.
"If it is to be true, it signals effectively a swing price... that knocks out lepidolite supply...If there were ever a group that could keep a mine running it would be CATL," Henderson said. Lepidolite is a lithium mineral that is costly to process.
Pilbara reported a 78% plunge in first-half profits on weak lithium prices and withheld dividends to preserve capital for project investments.
Other major producers in Australia, which supplies around half the world's sea-borne lithium, doubled down on cost cuts and said they would review the timing of new investments pending market conditions.
Diversified miner Mineral Resources said it may curtail the timing of first production from its Wodgina train 3 concentrator which was due mid year. The build out of a fourth train, still slated for 2026, could be delayed, according to Citi analysts.
"On pricing, MIN thinks it’s close to the bottom here and price will come back after CNY," said Citi in a note. Mineral Resources reported underlying earnings of A$649 million, down 28% on the same half a year earlier.
Battery minerals producer IGO lodged a 26% profit drop and said timing of a fourth ore processing plant at its Greenbushes mine may be adjusted. It is due to start commissioning in 2027.

Here's Why We Think Pilbara Minerals (ASX:PLS) Might Deserve Your Attention Today

Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.
So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like 
 (
). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.
Strong earnings per share (EPS) results are an indicator of a company achieving solid profits, which investors look upon favourably and so the share price tends to reflect great EPS performance. So a growing EPS generally brings attention to a company in the eyes of prospective investors. It's an outstanding feat for Pilbara Minerals to have grown EPS from AU$0.19 to AU$0.79 in just one year. Even though that growth rate may not be repeated, that looks like a breakout improvement. But the key is discerning whether something profound has changed, or if this is a just a one-off boost.
Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. The good news is that Pilbara Minerals is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 14.5 percentage points to 79%, over the last year. That's great to see, on both counts.
The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. For finer detail, click on the image.
The trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are 
 perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check 
 100% free.
Owing to the size of Pilbara Minerals, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they hold AU$71m worth of its stock. That's a lot of money, and no small incentive to work hard. Despite being just 0.6% of the company, the value of that investment is enough to show insiders have plenty riding on the venture.
Pilbara Minerals' earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here. So at the surface level, Pilbara Minerals is worth putting on your watchlist; after all, shareholders do well when the market underestimates fast growing companies. What about risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted 
 (of which 1 is a bit unpleasant!) you should know about.
While opting for stocks without growing earnings and absent insider buying can yield results, for investors valuing these key metrics, here is

Investors Shouldn't Overlook Pilbara Minerals' (ASX:PLS) Impressive Returns On Capital

If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing 
 on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's 
 of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in 
 (
) returns on capital, so let's have a look.
For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Pilbara Minerals:
0.47 = AU$1.8b ÷ (AU$4.4b - AU$552m) 
.
So, 
 That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 10% earned by companies in a similar industry.
In the above chart we have measured Pilbara Minerals' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can 
 for 
We're delighted to see that Pilbara Minerals is reaping rewards from its investments and is now generating some pre-tax profits. About five years ago the company was generating losses but things have turned around because it's now earning 47% on its capital. Not only that, but the company is utilizing 705% more capital than before, but that's to be expected from a company trying to break into profitability. We like this trend, because it tells us the company has profitable reinvestment opportunities available to it, and if it continues going forward that can lead to a multi-bagger performance.
To the delight of most shareholders, Pilbara Minerals has now broken into profitability. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.
Like most companies, Pilbara Minerals does come with some risks, and we've found
 that you should be aware of.

The company has successfully executed on ramping up the expansion of Pilgangoora while progressing plans to expand output. Supported by a strong balance sheet, with net cash at ~A$2.1bn at the end of December, PLS’ expansion plans remain uniquely undeterred by the significant weakness in lithium prices,”

One of my favorite ways to trade the lithium story is with an exchange-traded fund (ETF). Not only do they allow you to diversify with dozens of stocks, but they’re also far less expensive. Look at the 
 (NASDAQ:
), for example.
With an expense ratio of 0.65%, the ETF has 49 holdings, and trades for just under $11 a share. While its chart is a disaster, that’s to be expected with the latest pullback in lithium stocks. However, with growing demand for lithium, and the potential for short supply, the ETF will eventually come back strong.
Some of its top holdings include Albemarle, 
 (NYSE:
), American Lithium, and 
 (OTCMKTS:
).
Technically, after bottoming out at around $8.50 a share, the LITP ETF ran to $10.93. Now at $10.23, it’s just starting to pivot higher again. Moving forward, I’d like to see it test $12.50 initially.

Another safe way to trade the lithium story at a low cost is with the

Not only is it excessively oversold, but it also offers solid exposure to other beaten-down lithium-related names: Albemarle, 
 (NASDAQ:
), 
 (OTCMKTS:

 (OTCMKTS:

Last trading at $44.76, I’d like to see the LIT ETF initially retest $52. The fund will also benefit from a potential transition to green energy, and it’s need for lithium.

UPDATE 1-Pilbara Minerals signs spodumene supply deal with China's Sichuan Yahua

(Adds details on lithium offtake in paragraphs 2-6)
March 12 (Reuters) - Lithium miner Pilbara Minerals said on Tuesday it has signed an agreement with Sichuan Yahua Industrial Group for the supply of spodumene concentrate from its Pilgangoora operation in Western Australia.
Spodumene is a mineral with a high concentration of lithium, a key component in the production of batteries for electric vehicles.
Pilbara has agreed to supply the mineral at market price in an agreement signed for three years, the company said.
The Yahua Industrial Group has strong connections across the lithium supply chain with key customers, including Tesla , LG Energy Solutions, LG Chem, and Contemporary Amperex Technology.
Pilbara Minerals plans to supply between 20 thousand tonnes (kt) and 80 kt of spodumene concentrate to Yahua in 2024, it said, adding that it would eventually increase its supply between 100 kt and 160 kt in 2025.
"The agreement enables Yahua to further expand its supply chain commitments with key global battery customers and builds-out Pilbara Minerals medium-term sales profile whilst preserving long-term optionality," Pilbara's Managing Director and CEO Dale Henderson said.

UPDATE 2-Lithium miner Pilbara Minerals accepts pre-auction offer for spodumene cargo

(Adds dateline, analyst comment in paragraph 8)
MELBOURNE, March 14 (Reuters) - Australia's Pilbara Minerals said on Thursday it has accepted a pre-auction offer for a shipment of 5,000 dry metric tonnes (dmt) of lithium spodumene concentrate cargo from a group of registered auction participants.
The shipment was made available for sale to a group of registered participants prior to the auction on Pilbara's Battery Metal Exchange (BMX), which had been scheduled for March 18, it said in an exchange filing.
Australia's biggest independent lithium miner has now allocated most of its supply for the year, it said, and future spot sales on the BMX exchange are unlikely.
Pilbara said on Tuesday it had inked a spodumene concentrate supply deal with Tesla supplier Sichuan Yahua Industrial Group, to be delivered from its Pilgangoora operation in Western Australia.
The lithium miner indicated that it received a number of offers prior to the auction and has accepted one and executed a sales contract with the buyer, whose name it did not disclose.
The lithium market has been stabilising after prices plunged more than 70% in 2023 on slower-than-expected sales growth of electric vehicles, as well as higher production and over-supply of the metal.
"The offer is good evidence and support of future demand and the pricing horizon," said analyst Tim Hoff of Canaccord in Perth.
The offer prices the shipment at $1,200 per dmt on a SC6.0 CIF China equivalent basis after adjusting for lithium content and including freight costs, Pilbara said.
The shipment is contracted for the December quarter given the firm already has existing offtake agreements with other parties. (Reporting by Megha Rani and Melanie Burton; Editing by Janane Venkatraman and Christopher Cushing)

Will Weakness in Pilbara Minerals Limited's (ASX:PLS) Stock Prove Temporary Given Strong Fundamentals?

Pilbara Minerals (ASX:PLS) has had a rough month with its share price down 8.2%. However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Particularly, we will be paying attention to 
 ROE today.
ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.
The 
 is:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Pilbara Minerals is:
43% = AU$1.4b ÷ AU$3.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).
The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each A$1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made A$0.43 in profit.
So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or "retains", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.
To begin with, Pilbara Minerals has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 10% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. Under the circumstances, Pilbara Minerals' considerable five year net income growth of 77% was to be expected.
As a next step, we compared Pilbara Minerals' net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 21%.
The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is Pilbara Minerals fairly valued compared to other companies? These 
 might help you decide.
While the company did pay out a portion of its dividend in the past, it currently doesn't pay a dividend. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.
Overall, we are quite pleased with Pilbara Minerals' performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

Pilbara Minerals Limited (ASX:PLS) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 59% of the company

A look at the shareholders of Pilbara Minerals Limited (
) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 59% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).
Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Pilbara Minerals.
Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.
As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Pilbara Minerals. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Pilbara Minerals' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Pilbara Minerals is not owned by hedge funds. State Street Global Advisors, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 11% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.4% and 6.3% of the stock.
We did some more digging and found that 9 of the top shareholders account for roughly 51% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.
I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.
Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Pilbara Minerals Limited in their own names. It's a big company, so even a small proportional interest can create alignment between the board and shareholders. In this case insiders own AU$76m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking 
With a 32% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Pilbara Minerals. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.
Public companies currently own 8.5% of Pilbara Minerals stock. We can't be certain but it is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together.
It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Pilbara Minerals better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified 
 that you should be aware of.
If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check

Are Investors Undervaluing Pilbara Minerals Limited (ASX:PLS) By 46%?

In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Pilbara Minerals Limited (
) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!
We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the 
 may be something of interest to you.
We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:
 = AU$4.7b
We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.3%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.5%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$1.4b× (1 + 2.3%) ÷ (7.5%– 2.3%) = AU$27b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$27b÷ ( 1 + 7.5%)
= AU$13b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is AU$18b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of AU$3.2, the company appears quite good value at a 46% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.
Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Pilbara Minerals as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.146. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For Pilbara Minerals, there are three important elements you should assess:

You’ve Been Warned! 7 Lithium Stocks to Buy Now or Regret Forever.

If you are looking for the most undervalued 
 to buy now, you’ve come to the right place. These companies represent the best deals in the market, trading at attractive valuations and having promising outlooks for the future.
I chose these lithium stocks to buy due to their robust competitive advantages and wide moats in the industry. They have established themselves as low-cost producers, leveraging economies of scale and favorable mineral deposit locations. Their operational strengths allow them to extract lithium cost-efficiently, providing an edge over rivals.
The electric vehicle (EV) market is experiencing significant growth. The International Energy Agency reported that 
 of new car sales in 2023 were electric. In the first quarter alone, more than 2.3 million EVs were sold, a 25% increase compared to the previous year. With the demand for lithium outpacing supply and this trend expected to continue through 2030, lithium stocks present a compelling investment opportunity.
Here are seven lithium stocks to buy now or regret forever, offering substantial growth opportunities for your portfolio.

(NYSE:
) reported strong financial performance for the first quarter of 2024, with 
 of $1.4 billion. This growth was primarily driven by the increased demand for lithium in energy storage and electric vehicles. Despite some challenges with weaker demand in specific sectors, the company’s adjusted EBITDA remained robust.
Furthermore, Albemarle 
 for its Kings Mountain Mine, which is one of the few known hard-rock lithium deposits in the U.S. This mine is expected to produce approximately 420,000 tons of lithium-bearing spodumene concentrate annually, significantly bolstering the U.S. supply chain for lithium.
Also, Albemarle completed a 
 public mandatory convertible preferred stock offering. This move aims to enhance the company’s financial flexibility and support its growth investments.
All of these developments position ALB well for the future, which makes it one of the best lithium stocks for investors to consider.

 for the first quarter of 2024, driven by strong average realized lithium hydroxide and carbonate pricing, which exceeded $20,000 per metric ton. The company achieved a net income of $15.6 million. Despite facing some challenges, the company remains on track to realize significant synergies and cost savings of $60 to $80 million in 2024​.
Adding to the bullish thesis for ALTM is that its 
 and next year is expected to swell 44% and 37%, respectively, according to analysts who cover ALTM. Very sizable EPS increases in the double digits are also predicted on the horizon.
Given these facts, I think ALTM could be a great addition to many investors’ portfolios. Furthermore, ALTM has one of the lowest valuations out of all the lithium stocks on this list, with the company trading at a tiny forward price-to-sales ratio of just 1.7x.

Pilbara Minerals progresses towards expanding Pilgangoora lithium output

Pilbara Minerals has announced the pre-feasibility study (PFS) for the P2000 Project, which could significantly expand lithium production at its Pilgangoora operation in Western Australia.
The P2000 Project, named for its production target, is expected to yield 1.9mtpa for the first ten years, with more than 2mtpa during the initial six years post-ramp-up.
This expansion aligns with the company's strategic growth objectives and the rising demand for lithium.
The project is expected to position the company as the world's largest pure play lithium producer, with an anticipated increase to more than 2mt per annum.
Progression of the P2000 Project will depend on the results of the forthcoming feasibility study, necessary project approvals and the market conditions at the time of the financial investment decision.
The proposed expansion includes the construction of a new flotation plant, estimated to cost A$1.2bn ($797.9m), which will operate alongside the current processing facilities at Pilgangoora.
The anticipated shareholder value from the P2000 expansion is substantial, with an incremental net present value (NPV) of $2.6bn and an internal rate of return (IRR) of 55%.
These figures underscore the project's potential profitability and its impact on the company's financial performance.
A feasibility study for the P2000 Project is under way, with results expected by the end of 2025. Following the study, a financial investment decision will be made.
Pilbara Minerals is exploring various funding options for the project, including its existing cash reserves, production cash flows, new loans or other financial sources.
In addition to increasing production capacity, the P2000 Project is set to open up new opportunities for spodumene concentrate offtake and strategic partnerships.
Pilbara Minerals is actively pursuing these opportunities concurrently with the feasibility study and financial investment decision processes.
Pilbara Minerals managing director and CEO Dale Henderson said: “The PFS demonstrates a strong value accretive project with an incremental NPV of $2.6bn through this potential future expansion to the operation at Pilgangoora.
“This study follows the 35% reserve upgrade to 214mt announced in August last year. The growth of the reserve, and the optionality to incrementally expand production, further reinforces Pilgangoora’s position as a Tier 1 asset of global significance.
“This expansion is expected to provide an average 1.9mtpa production for the first ten years and more than 2mtpa over the first six years after ramp-up. The scale benefits of this expansion will further build on Pilbara Minerals’ position as one of the major leading lithium suppliers globally.”

Despite shrinking by AU$1.1b in the past week, Pilbara Minerals (ASX:PLS) shareholders are still up 982% over 3 years

While 
 (
) shareholders are probably generally happy, the stock hasn't had particularly good run recently, with the share price falling 21% in the last quarter. But over the last three years the stock has shone bright like a diamond. The longer term view reveals that the share price is up 853% in that period. So you might argue that the recent reduction in the share price is unremarkable in light of the longer term performance. The share price action could signify that the business itself is dramatically improved, in that time. Anyone who held for that rewarding ride would probably be keen to talk about it.
Since the long term performance has been good but there's been a recent pullback of 8.3%, let's check if the fundamentals match the share price.
In his essay 
 Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.
During three years of share price growth, Pilbara Minerals moved from a loss to profitability. Given the importance of this milestone, it's not overly surprising that the share price has increased strongly.
The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).
It is of course excellent to see how Pilbara Minerals has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. Take a more thorough look at Pilbara Minerals' financial health with this 
 
.
It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Pilbara Minerals' TSR for the last 3 years was 982%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!
Pilbara Minerals shareholders are down 18% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 7.6%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 42%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted

Pilbara Minerals Limited (ASX:PLS) Analysts Are Reducing Their Forecasts For This Year

One thing we could say about the analysts on 
 (
) - they aren't optimistic, having just made a major negative revision to their near-term (statutory) forecasts for the organization. Both revenue and earnings per share (EPS) estimates were cut sharply as analysts factored in the latest outlook for the business, concluding that they were too optimistic previously.
Following the downgrade, the consensus from 15 analysts covering Pilbara Minerals is for revenues of AU$2.1b in 2024, implying a substantial 48% decline in sales compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are anticipated to plummet 58% to AU$0.33 in the same period. Before this latest update, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of AU$2.4b and earnings per share (EPS) of AU$0.38 in 2024. Indeed, we can see that the analysts are a lot more bearish about Pilbara Minerals' prospects, administering a measurable cut to revenue estimates and slashing their EPS estimates to boot.
Despite the cuts to forecast earnings, there was no real change to the AU$4.66 price target, showing that the analysts don't think the changes have a meaningful impact on its intrinsic value.
One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. We would highlight that sales are expected to reverse, with a forecast 48% annualised revenue decline to the end of 2024. That is a notable change from historical growth of 82% over the last five years. Compare this with our data, which suggests that other companies in the same industry are, in aggregate, expected to see their revenue grow 2.3% per year. So although its revenues are forecast to shrink, this cloud does not come with a silver lining - Pilbara Minerals is expected to lag the wider industry.
The most important thing to take away is that analysts cut their earnings per share estimates, expecting a clear decline in business conditions. Regrettably, they also downgraded their revenue estimates, and the latest forecasts imply the business will grow sales slower than the wider market. The lack of change in the price target is puzzling in light of the downgrade but, with a serious decline expected this year, we wouldn't be surprised if investors were a bit wary of Pilbara Minerals.
With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for Pilbara Minerals going out to 2026, and you can 
Of course, seeing company management

Lithium producers stay bullish on EVs despite growing headwinds

By Ernest Scheyder and Melanie Burton
(Reuters) - The world's largest lithium producers say they remain bullish on long-term demand for the battery material in the midst of recent price drops fueled by growing worries that the global pace of electric vehicle adoption is slowing.
LG Energy Solution, General Motors, Honda and other auto and battery makers have trimmed EV expansion plans in recent weeks, partly due to rising interest rates, which in turn has stoked concerns of a supply glut for the battery metal.
A basket of prices for lithium - which vary by region and by type - tracked by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence has dropped more than 60% this year.
While demand for the ultralight battery metal is still expected to rise this year from 2022 levels, investors' expectations for white-hot industry growth were dampened by sluggish quarterly reports from Albemarle, Pilbara Minerals, Livent and others.
In Australia, the world's largest lithium-producing nation, Pilbara Minerals is the most-shorted stock on the Australian Stock Exchange, suggesting investors have a negative view on lithium demand.
The bearish sentiment has affected more than just lithium producers. Lithium Royalty Corp, a lithium investor, has lost more than 37% of its value since listing in Toronto earlier this year. The Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF has dropped 18% this year.
Chris Berry, an independent lithium analyst and consultant, advises clients to focus on a range of prices for the key battery metal, not just spot, adding that prices today remain far above historical trends.
"While the spot price has cratered, I haven't seen an evaporating of demand which would validate the trajectory of the spot price," Berry said.
In calls with investors and analysts in recent days, lithium producers said they saw the market volatility as short term, adding that they expect electrification to keep growing.
"We see what's happening now as road bumps, but certainly not a determinant for the long-term growth we have," Eric Norris, head of Albemarle's Energy Storage division, told investors on Thursday after the company cut its annual forecast and reported disappointing quarterly results.
Livent, which supplies BMW and Tesla said it continues to expect strong lithium sales despite its own weak results. "We see (lithium) supply continuing to be the constraint on demand," said Livent CEO Paul Graves.
Pilbara last week flagged a "softening market backdrop" and ruled out share buybacks or special dividends for shareholders. Still, executives said that decision was born from a desire to be cautious for the time being.
"Demand is absolutely there," said Pilbara CEO Dale Henderson. "It's just a case of moderating pricing. It's still a very healthy market."
Mineral Resources, which operates lithium mines with Albemarle and Jiangxi Ganfeng Lithium, described the market's current state as a "rebalancing" of supply chains.
And IGO, which holds a stake in a joint venture that controls Greenbushes, the world's largest lithium mine, warned of ongoing market volatility earlier this week, but added it believed the industry's troubles were only "near term".

Pilbara Minerals Limited (ASX:PLS) most popular amongst individual investors who own 44% of the shares, institutions hold 43%

A look at the shareholders of Pilbara Minerals Limited (
) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that individual investors own the lion's share in the company with 44% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
Institutions, on the other hand, account for 43% of the company's stockholders. Institutions often own shares in more established companies, while it's not unusual to see insiders own a fair bit of smaller companies.
Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Pilbara Minerals.
Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.
Pilbara Minerals already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Pilbara Minerals' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.
We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Pilbara Minerals. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is State Street Global Advisors, Inc. with 9.9% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 6.3% and 5.7% of the stock.
A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 17 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.
While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.
Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.
Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Pilbara Minerals Limited. It's a big company, so even a small proportional interest can create alignment between the board and shareholders. In this case insiders own AU$72m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking 
The general public-- including retail investors -- own 44% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.
Public companies currently own 13% of Pilbara Minerals stock. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.
It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Pilbara Minerals better, we need to consider many other factors. Be aware that

Estimating The Intrinsic Value Of Pilbara Minerals Limited (ASX:PLS)

Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Pilbara Minerals Limited (ASX:PLS) as an investment opportunity by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!
We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the 
.
We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:
 = AU$4.8b
After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.5%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$974m× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.5%– 2.1%) = AU$18b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$18b÷ ( 1 + 7.5%)
= AU$8.9b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is AU$14b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of AU$4.0, the company appears about fair value at a 13% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.
The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Pilbara Minerals as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.087. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to "what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For Pilbara Minerals, we've put together three essential factors you should explore:

These Analysts Just Made A Meaningful Downgrade To Their Pilbara Minerals Limited (ASX:PLS) EPS Forecasts

Market forces rained on the parade of 
 (
) shareholders today, when the analysts downgraded their forecasts for this year. Both revenue and earnings per share (EPS) forecasts went under the knife, suggesting the analysts have soured majorly on the business.
Following the downgrade, the consensus from 17 analysts covering Pilbara Minerals is for revenues of AU$1.4b in 2024, implying a stressful 65% decline in sales compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are supposed to plunge 78% to AU$0.17 in the same period. Before this latest update, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of AU$1.6b and earnings per share (EPS) of AU$0.22 in 2024. It looks like analyst sentiment has declined substantially, with a substantial drop in revenue estimates and a pretty serious decline to earnings per share numbers as well.
Despite the cuts to forecast earnings, there was no real change to the AU$3.78 price target, showing that the analysts don't think the changes have a meaningful impact on its intrinsic value.
Of course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. These estimates imply that sales are expected to slow, with a forecast annualised revenue decline of 65% by the end of 2024. This indicates a significant reduction from annual growth of 82% over the last five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the same industry are forecast to see their revenue grow 2.2% annually for the foreseeable future. So although its revenues are forecast to shrink, this cloud does not come with a silver lining - Pilbara Minerals is expected to lag the wider industry.
The biggest issue in the new estimates is that analysts have reduced their earnings per share estimates, suggesting business headwinds lay ahead for Pilbara Minerals. Regrettably, they also downgraded their revenue estimates, and the latest forecasts imply the business will grow sales slower than the wider market. We're also surprised to see that the price target went unchanged. Still, deteriorating business conditions (assuming accurate forecasts!) can be a leading indicator for the stock price, so we wouldn't blame investors for being more cautious on Pilbara Minerals after the downgrade.
Still, the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for Pilbara Minerals going out to 2026, and you can

UPDATE 2-AustralianSuper ups stakes in Pilbara Minerals, Endeavour Group

(Adds AustralianSuper's response)
Jan 9 (Reuters) - Pension fund AustralianSuper has raised its stake in lithium miner Pilbara Minerals and alcohol retailer Endeavour Group, two separate exchange filings showed on Tuesday.
The stake increase makes AustralianSuper the largest stakeholder in Pilbara with a 6.1% interest, overtaking a Ganfeng Lithium Group subsidiary, which owns 5.74%, according to LSEG data.
AustralianSuper maintained its position as the third-largest shareholder in Endeavour, building its stake up to 8.8% from 7.65%.
The country's largest pension fund, which manages over A$300 billion ($201.27 billion) of retirement savings, declined to comment on the stake increases.
AustralianSuper has, in the last few months, shifted its attitude towards investing in some of the country's largest companies, and is now actively scooping up stakes in blue-chip firms to give itself more leverage and control on strategy.
It bought Pilbara shares worth A$558 million in November last year, at a time when domestic lithium miners were being closely watched by global players as acquisition targets.
Endeavour, the country's biggest pub owner, is going through a board shake-up with Chair Peter Hearl resigning after a period of disagreement with top shareholder and billionaire publican Bruce Mathieson.
Pilbara and Endeavour did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comments.

Pilbara Minerals' Q2 revenue halves, focuses on cutting costs

Australia's Pilbara Minerals reported a 46% sequential drop in its second-quarter revenue on Wednesday as average realised price for spodumene halved, and lowered annual capital expenditure guidance.
Australian lithium producers may be set to track the nickel industry in project curtailments and delays this reporting season, analysts say, given slower-than-expected electric vehicle (EV) sales that have hit prices but the jolt is expected to be less severe.
"Market pricing for spodumene concentrate and lithium chemicals is expected to remain volatile in the near-term given uncertain macroeconomic conditions," Pilbara said.
The company said it is focusing on cutting costs to preserve its cash and was going ahead with expansion plans to create intermediate products which it can fund from its reserves.
The company cut its fiscal 2024 capital expenditure forecast to A$820 million-$875 million from A$875 million-A$975 million.
"With confidence in the long-term outlook, the Group is continuing with its previously announced strategy of prioritising investment in expanding production through the P680 and P1000 Projects," the company added
This will yield both increased production capacity and result in scale benefits such as reduced unit costs to strengthen the profitability of the operation, it added.
Pilbara posted revenue of A$264 million ($173.71 million) for the quarter ended December 31, down from A$493 million in the previous quarter.

Here's Why We Think Pilbara Minerals (ASX:PLS) Might Deserve Your Attention Today

Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.
So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like 
 (
). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.
Strong earnings per share (EPS) results are an indicator of a company achieving solid profits, which investors look upon favourably and so the share price tends to reflect great EPS performance. So a growing EPS generally brings attention to a company in the eyes of prospective investors. It's an outstanding feat for Pilbara Minerals to have grown EPS from AU$0.19 to AU$0.79 in just one year. Even though that growth rate may not be repeated, that looks like a breakout improvement. But the key is discerning whether something profound has changed, or if this is a just a one-off boost.
Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. The good news is that Pilbara Minerals is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 14.5 percentage points to 79%, over the last year. That's great to see, on both counts.
The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. For finer detail, click on the image.
The trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are 
 perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check 
 100% free.
Owing to the size of Pilbara Minerals, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they hold AU$71m worth of its stock. That's a lot of money, and no small incentive to work hard. Despite being just 0.6% of the company, the value of that investment is enough to show insiders have plenty riding on the venture.
Pilbara Minerals' earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here. So at the surface level, Pilbara Minerals is worth putting on your watchlist; after all, shareholders do well when the market underestimates fast growing companies. What about risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted 
 (of which 1 is a bit unpleasant!) you should know about.
While opting for stocks without growing earnings and absent insider buying can yield results, for investors valuing these key metrics, here is

Australia's lithium producers see signs market is stabilising

MELBOURNE, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Pilbara Minerals said on Thursday it saw signs the lithium market was stabilising as Australia's top producers reported a slump in earnings and took steps to ride out slowing demand for the raw material of electric vehicle batteries.
Lithium prices have fallen around 70% over the past year as EV sales growth slowed, but capacity expansions by chemicals makers and government support globally bode well for the market longer term, Pilbara Minerals CEO Dale Henderson said.
In the short term, prices of lithium ore spodumene appear to have levelled out, with a small increase in China's lithium carbonate prices and more customer enquiries over the last eight weeks than in "quite some period", Henderson told an earnings call.
Top battery maker CATL's closure of its high cost Jianxiawo lepidolite operations would be a positive sign for the market, he said. Australian lithium stocks gained early this week after Reuters reported speculation about the closure.
"If it is to be true, it signals effectively a swing price... that knocks out lepidolite supply...If there were ever a group that could keep a mine running it would be CATL," Henderson said. Lepidolite is a lithium mineral that is costly to process.
Pilbara reported a 78% plunge in first-half profits on weak lithium prices and withheld dividends to preserve capital for project investments.
Other major producers in Australia, which supplies around half the world's sea-borne lithium, doubled down on cost cuts and said they would review the timing of new investments pending market conditions.
Diversified miner Mineral Resources said it may curtail the timing of first production from its Wodgina train 3 concentrator which was due mid year. The build out of a fourth train, still slated for 2026, could be delayed, according to Citi analysts.
"On pricing, MIN thinks it’s close to the bottom here and price will come back after CNY," said Citi in a note. Mineral Resources reported underlying earnings of A$649 million, down 28% on the same half a year earlier.
Battery minerals producer IGO lodged a 26% profit drop and said timing of a fourth ore processing plant at its Greenbushes mine may be adjusted. It is due to start commissioning in 2027.

For one, Australian firm, Morgans just added Pilbara Minerals to its best ideas list.
They said, “We view PLS as a fundamentally strong and globally significant hard-rock lithium miner. The company has successfully executed on ramping up the expansion of Pilgangoora while progressing plans to expand output. Supported by a strong balance sheet, with net cash at ~A$2.1bn at the end of December, PLS’ expansion plans remain uniquely undeterred by the significant weakness in lithium prices,”

Earnings could use some improvement, though. In its last quarter, the company posted EPS of 34 cents, which beat estimates by 11 cents. However, revenues of $181.8 million were down about $36.9 million. However, both numbers are likely to improve, as lithium slowly recovers.
Helping, according to 
: “One of the many benefits of the merger is the opportunity to both optimize and de-risk our growth projects that have natural overlaps. By slowing capital spending in 2024, we can accelerate the work needed to drive capital efficiencies in both Argentina and Québec. We expect this will ultimately help us realize lower overall capital spending across the Fénix and Sal de Vida projects, as well as between the James Bay and Nemaska Lithium projects.”

One of my favorite ways to trade the lithium story is with an exchange-traded fund (ETF). Not only do they allow you to diversify with dozens of stocks, but they’re also far less expensive. Look at the 
 (NASDAQ:
), for example.
With an expense ratio of 0.65%, the ETF has 49 holdings, and trades for just under $11 a share. While its chart is a disaster, that’s to be expected with the latest pullback in lithium stocks. However, with growing demand for lithium, and the potential for short supply, the ETF will eventually come back strong.
Some of its top holdings include Albemarle, 
 (NYSE:
), American Lithium, and 
 (OTCMKTS:
).
Technically, after bottoming out at around $8.50 a share, the LITP ETF ran to $10.93. Now at $10.23, it’s just starting to pivot higher again. Moving forward, I’d like to see it test $12.50 initially.

Another safe way to trade the lithium story at a low cost is with the 
 (NYSEARCA:

Not only is it excessively oversold, but it also offers solid exposure to other beaten-down lithium-related names: Albemarle, 
 (NASDAQ:
), 
 (OTCMKTS:
), and 
 (OTCMKTS:
) to name some of its 46 holdings.
Last trading at $44.76, I’d like to see the LIT ETF initially retest $52. The fund will also benefit from a potential transition to green energy, and it’s need for lithium.
, at the 2023 Conference of the Parties (COP28) meeting, 200 countries agreed to transition from fossil fuels, drafting text that would result in“tripling renewable energy capacity globally and doubling the global average annual rate of energy efficiency improvements by 2030,” according to

Investors Shouldn't Overlook Pilbara Minerals' (ASX:PLS) Impressive Returns On Capital

If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing 
 on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's 
 of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in 
 (
) returns on capital, so let's have a look.
For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Pilbara Minerals:
0.47 = AU$1.8b ÷ (AU$4.4b - AU$552m) 
.
So, 
 That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 10% earned by companies in a similar industry.
In the above chart we have measured Pilbara Minerals' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can 
 for 
We're delighted to see that Pilbara Minerals is reaping rewards from its investments and is now generating some pre-tax profits. About five years ago the company was generating losses but things have turned around because it's now earning 47% on its capital. Not only that, but the company is utilizing 705% more capital than before, but that's to be expected from a company trying to break into profitability. We like this trend, because it tells us the company has profitable reinvestment opportunities available to it, and if it continues going forward that can lead to a multi-bagger performance.
To the delight of most shareholders, Pilbara Minerals has now broken into profitability. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.
Like most companies, Pilbara Minerals does come with some risks, and we've found
 that you should be aware of.

UPDATE 2-Lithium miner Pilbara Minerals accepts pre-auction offer for spodumene cargo

(Adds dateline, analyst comment in paragraph 8)
MELBOURNE, March 14 (Reuters) - Australia's Pilbara Minerals said on Thursday it has accepted a pre-auction offer for a shipment of 5,000 dry metric tonnes (dmt) of lithium spodumene concentrate cargo from a group of registered auction participants.
The shipment was made available for sale to a group of registered participants prior to the auction on Pilbara's Battery Metal Exchange (BMX), which had been scheduled for March 18, it said in an exchange filing.
Australia's biggest independent lithium miner has now allocated most of its supply for the year, it said, and future spot sales on the BMX exchange are unlikely.
Pilbara said on Tuesday it had inked a spodumene concentrate supply deal with Tesla supplier Sichuan Yahua Industrial Group, to be delivered from its Pilgangoora operation in Western Australia.
The lithium miner indicated that it received a number of offers prior to the auction and has accepted one and executed a sales contract with the buyer, whose name it did not disclose.
The lithium market has been stabilising after prices plunged more than 70% in 2023 on slower-than-expected sales growth of electric vehicles, as well as higher production and over-supply of the metal.
"The offer is good evidence and support of future demand and the pricing horizon," said analyst Tim Hoff of Canaccord in Perth.
The offer prices the shipment at $1,200 per dmt on a SC6.0 CIF China equivalent basis after adjusting for lithium content and including freight costs, Pilbara said.
The shipment is contracted for the December quarter given the firm already has existing offtake agreements with other parties. (Reporting by Megha Rani and Melanie Burton; Editing by Janane Venkatraman and Christopher Cushing)

Will Weakness in Pilbara Minerals Limited's (ASX:PLS) Stock Prove Temporary Given Strong Fundamentals?

Pilbara Minerals (ASX:PLS) has had a rough month with its share price down 8.2%. However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Particularly, we will be paying attention to 
 ROE today.
ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.
The 
 is:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Pilbara Minerals is:
43% = AU$1.4b ÷ AU$3.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).
The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each A$1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made A$0.43 in profit.
So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or "retains", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.
To begin with, Pilbara Minerals has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 10% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. Under the circumstances, Pilbara Minerals' considerable five year net income growth of 77% was to be expected.
As a next step, we compared Pilbara Minerals' net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 21%.
The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is Pilbara Minerals fairly valued compared to other companies? These 
 might help you decide.
While the company did pay out a portion of its dividend in the past, it currently doesn't pay a dividend. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.
Overall, we are quite pleased with Pilbara Minerals' performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

Pilbara Minerals progresses towards expanding Pilgangoora lithium output

Pilbara Minerals has announced the pre-feasibility study (PFS) for the P2000 Project, which could significantly expand lithium production at its Pilgangoora operation in Western Australia.
The P2000 Project, named for its production target, is expected to yield 1.9mtpa for the first ten years, with more than 2mtpa during the initial six years post-ramp-up.
This expansion aligns with the company's strategic growth objectives and the rising demand for lithium.
The project is expected to position the company as the world's largest pure play lithium producer, with an anticipated increase to more than 2mt per annum.
Progression of the P2000 Project will depend on the results of the forthcoming feasibility study, necessary project approvals and the market conditions at the time of the financial investment decision.
The proposed expansion includes the construction of a new flotation plant, estimated to cost A$1.2bn ($797.9m), which will operate alongside the current processing facilities at Pilgangoora.
The anticipated shareholder value from the P2000 expansion is substantial, with an incremental net present value (NPV) of $2.6bn and an internal rate of return (IRR) of 55%.
These figures underscore the project's potential profitability and its impact on the company's financial performance.
A feasibility study for the P2000 Project is under way, with results expected by the end of 2025. Following the study, a financial investment decision will be made.
Pilbara Minerals is exploring various funding options for the project, including its existing cash reserves, production cash flows, new loans or other financial sources.
In addition to increasing production capacity, the P2000 Project is set to open up new opportunities for spodumene concentrate offtake and strategic partnerships.
Pilbara Minerals is actively pursuing these opportunities concurrently with the feasibility study and financial investment decision processes.
Pilbara Minerals managing director and CEO Dale Henderson said: “The PFS demonstrates a strong value accretive project with an incremental NPV of $2.6bn through this potential future expansion to the operation at Pilgangoora.
“This study follows the 35% reserve upgrade to 214mt announced in August last year. The growth of the reserve, and the optionality to incrementally expand production, further reinforces Pilgangoora’s position as a Tier 1 asset of global significance.
“This expansion is expected to provide an average 1.9mtpa production for the first ten years and more than 2mtpa over the first six years after ramp-up. The scale benefits of this expansion will further build on Pilbara Minerals’ position as one of the major leading lithium suppliers globally.”

UPDATE 1-Pilbara Minerals signs spodumene supply deal with China's Sichuan Yahua

(Adds details on lithium offtake in paragraphs 2-6)
March 12 (Reuters) - Lithium miner Pilbara Minerals said on Tuesday it has signed an agreement with Sichuan Yahua Industrial Group for the supply of spodumene concentrate from its Pilgangoora operation in Western Australia.
Spodumene is a mineral with a high concentration of lithium, a key component in the production of batteries for electric vehicles.
Pilbara has agreed to supply the mineral at market price in an agreement signed for three years, the company said.
The Yahua Industrial Group has strong connections across the lithium supply chain with key customers, including Tesla , LG Energy Solutions, LG Chem, and Contemporary Amperex Technology.
Pilbara Minerals plans to supply between 20 thousand tonnes (kt) and 80 kt of spodumene concentrate to Yahua in 2024, it said, adding that it would eventually increase its supply between 100 kt and 160 kt in 2025.
"The agreement enables Yahua to further expand its supply chain commitments with key global battery customers and builds-out Pilbara Minerals medium-term sales profile whilst preserving long-term optionality," Pilbara's Managing Director and CEO Dale Henderson said.

Pilbara Minerals Limited (ASX:PLS) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 59% of the company

A look at the shareholders of Pilbara Minerals Limited (
) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 59% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).
Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Pilbara Minerals.
Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.
As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Pilbara Minerals. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Pilbara Minerals' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Pilbara Minerals is not owned by hedge funds. State Street Global Advisors, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 11% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.4% and 6.3% of the stock.
We did some more digging and found that 9 of the top shareholders account for roughly 51% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.
I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.
Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Pilbara Minerals Limited in their own names. It's a big company, so even a small proportional interest can create alignment between the board and shareholders. In this case insiders own AU$76m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking 
With a 32% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Pilbara Minerals. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.
Public companies currently own 8.5% of Pilbara Minerals stock. We can't be certain but it is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together.
It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Pilbara Minerals better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified 
 that you should be aware of.

Are Investors Undervaluing Pilbara Minerals Limited (ASX:PLS) By 46%?

In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Pilbara Minerals Limited (
) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!
We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the 
 may be something of interest to you.
We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:
 = AU$4.7b
We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.3%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.5%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$1.4b× (1 + 2.3%) ÷ (7.5%– 2.3%) = AU$27b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$27b÷ ( 1 + 7.5%)
= AU$13b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is AU$18b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of AU$3.2, the company appears quite good value at a 46% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.
Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Pilbara Minerals as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.146. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For Pilbara Minerals, there are three important elements you should assess:

They have established themselves as low-cost producers, leveraging economies of scale and favorable mineral deposit locations. Their operational strengths allow them to extract lithium cost-efficiently, providing an edge over rivals.
The electric vehicle (EV) market is experiencing significant growth. The International Energy Agency reported that 
 of new car sales in 2023 were electric. In the first quarter alone, more than 2.3 million EVs were sold, a 25% increase compared to the previous year. With the demand for lithium outpacing supply and this trend expected to continue through 2030, lithium stocks present a compelling investment opportunity.
Here are seven lithium stocks to buy now or regret forever, offering substantial growth opportunities for your portfolio.
