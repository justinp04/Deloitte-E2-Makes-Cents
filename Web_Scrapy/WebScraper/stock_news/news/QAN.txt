One more airline cracks down on lounge crowding in a way you won't like

Over the last two years, multiple airlines have 
 in their lounges. While they are designed as a luxury experience for a small subset of travelers, high numbers of people taking a trip post-pandemic as well as the different ways they are able to gain access through status or certain credit cards made it difficult for some airlines to 
 keeping foods stocked, common areas clean and having enough staff to serve bar drinks at the rate that customers expect them.
In the fall of 2023, Delta Air Lines 
 caught serious traveler outcry after announcing that it was 
on crowding by raising how much one needs to spend for lounge access and limiting the number of times one can enter those lounges.
Some airlines saw the outcry with Delta as their chance to reassure customers that they would not raise their fees while others waited for the storm to pass to quietly implement their own increases.
Australia's flagship carrier Qantas Airways 
 is the latest airline to announce that it would raise the cost accessing the 24 lounges across the country as well as the 600 international lounges available at airports across the world through partner airlines.
Unlike other airlines which grant access primarily after reaching frequent flyer status, Qantas also sells it through a membership — starting from April 18, 2024, prices will rise from $600 Australian dollars ($392 USD)  to $699 AUD ($456 USD) for one year, $1,100 ($718 USD) to $1,299 ($848 USD) for two years and $2,000 AUD ($1,304) to lock in the rate for four years.
Those signing up for lounge access for the first time also currently pay a joining fee of $99 AUD ($65 USD) that will rise to $129 AUD ($85 USD).
The airline also allows customers to purchase their membership with Qantas Points they collect through frequent travel; the membership fees are also being raised by the equivalent amount in points in what adds up to as much as 17% — from 308,000 to 399,900 to lock in access for four years.
"This is the first time the Qantas Club membership fees have increased in seven years and will help cover cost increases passed on from a range of suppliers over that time," a Qantas spokesperson confirmed to Simple Flying. "This follows a reduction in the membership fees for several years during the pandemic."
The spokesperson said the gains from the increases will go both towards making up for inflation-related costs and keeping existing lounges looking modern by updating features like furniture and décor.
While the price increases also do not apply for those who earned lounge access through frequent flyer status or change what it takes to earn that status, Qantas is also introducing even steeper increases for those renewing a membership or adding additional features such as spouse and partner memberships.
In some cases, the cost of these features will nearly double from what members are paying now.

What Is Qantas Airways Limited's (ASX:QAN) Share Price Doing?

Qantas Airways Limited (
), is not the largest company out there, but it saw significant share price movement during recent months on the ASX, rising to highs of AU$5.83 and falling to the lows of AU$5.01. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Qantas Airways' current trading price of AU$5.29 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Qantas Airways’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.
Great news for investors – Qantas Airways is still trading at a fairly cheap price according to our price multiple model, where we compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. We’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 5.46x is currently well-below the industry average of 8.48x, meaning that it is trading at a cheaper price relative to its peers. What’s more interesting is that, Qantas Airways’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.
Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of Qantas Airways, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting earnings growth of 3.1%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term.
 Even though growth is relatively muted, since QAN is currently trading below the industry PE ratio, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current price multiple.
 If you’ve been keeping an eye on QAN for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its future profit outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy QAN. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.
If you'd like to know more about Qantas Airways as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing. To help with this, we've discovered 
 (1 shouldn't be ignored!) that you ought to be aware of before buying any shares in Qantas Airways.

Qantas adjusting schedule as pilots at units plan another strike

(Reuters) -Qantas Airways , Australia's flag carrier, said on Monday that it is adjusting its schedule for a couple of days this week to mitigate any operational disruptions arising from a new planned strike by the pilots at its units.
The airline expects that most customers will reach their destinations on the same day as their bookings, utilising a mix of Qantas-owned and third-party aircraft.
Pilots at Network Aviation and QantasLink units will begin a new strike this week, as they persist in demanding higher pay, the Australian Federation of Air Pilots (AFAP) said in a statement on Monday.
The pilot groups are attempting to negotiate a new enterprise deal to replace the Network Aviation Pilots Enterprise Agreement 2016, which expired in October 2020.
Pilots at QantasLink and Network Aviation are set to halt work on Thursday and Friday, the AFAP said.
A hearing between the parties is also scheduled at Australia's Fair Work Commission on March 14 and 15, aiming to reach a settlement over a dispute that has persisted for nearly two years.
The union and the airline have been negotiating for over 18 months, during which the pilots have rejected three deals, including an offer of a pay increase of more than 25% and subsequent 3% annual increases.
The AFAP represents 95% of the commercial pilots employed by Qantas Group subsidiary Network Aviation, responsible for flying both passenger transport under QantasLink and fly-in fly-out (FIFO) as well as private charter aircraft under Network Aviation in Western Australia.

Australia's Qantas Airways expands frequent flyer loyalty programme

(Reuters) - Qantas Airways expanded its frequent flyer programme on Monday, offering access to 20 million more reward seats that can be purchased through points, as the Australian carrier plans to spend more on customers in a bid to fix its battered reputation.
The points required to book the airline's new "Classic Plus" reward seats will be more than its existing "Classic" seats and will vary like normal air fares, meaning they will be lower during off-peak periods or when booking early.
The company had one of its most reputationally damaging years in 2023, as it defended a competition regulator lawsuit over selling tickets to already-cancelled flights and as a court found the airline sacked 1,700 ground staff illegally in 2020.
Qantas has since promised to focus more on customer benefits and engagement, and expects to invest A$120 million ($78.74 million) in fiscal 2025 for the new program. It also expects the benefits from the program to outweigh the cost of investment in the first half of fiscal 2026.
The carrier added it expects the Qantas Loyalty division to deliver underlying earnings before interests and taxes between A$500 million and A$525 million in FY24.
"On first pass, the change appears to be a modest negative short term including higher investment, lower margin and lower profit," analysts at Citi wrote.
"In time, the hypothesis is this investment would stimulate volumes and earning activity that would outweigh costs, but mechanically would take time (18 months) to play out/prove up," they added.
Qantas said its new reward seats will be available to be booked from Monday across international flights departing from Australia for travel from July 1, and will be available across its full international and domestic network by the end of this year.
The Australian flag carrier also confirmed it would begin a stock buyback of up to A$448 million, which it announced in February and expects to complete by June 30.

An airline launched a sale so low it crashed its website

With the average airplane fare 
 from 2021 to 2024, it is not surprising that many people get excited when 
 come around.
Japan Airlines 
 and Cathay Pacific 
 both saw their websites temporarily go down after
 at different points last year.
The latest airline that had this happen is Jetstar, the budget offshoot of Australia's flagship airline Qantas Airways 
. As part of celebrating the fact that it was turning 20 years old this spring, Jetstar launched a sale in which some domestic routes across Australia could be bought for 29 Australian dollars ($19 USD) and less than $100 to nearby international destinations such as Bali.
The $29 is a specific nod to the cost of many of the domestic routes when Jetstar was founded in 2004. The lowest fares are limited to flights from Brisbane to Newcastle, Adelaide to Brisbane, Perth to the Gold Coast and Sydney to Byron Bay.
While the sale was launched on May 3 and was supposed to last five days, many of the available seats were snapped up within hours and the airline's website ended up crashing. Many Australians who were trying to make a purchase reported seeing a pop-up reading that Jetstar is "very busy right now and something has gone wrong — we are very sorry."
"What's the point of having a sale when you can't even get onto the page," reads one of the comments on the Instagram 
 post announcing the 20-year celebration.
"It's actually not working," reads another.
Jetstar had earlier told its online followers to "stay tuned for a big month of Birthday celebrations" but has not been responding to questions on whether the seats it had slated for the sale had sold out or more low fares would drop later.
While Jetstar has not been as heavily scrutinized as its parent company, Qantas Airways has been the source of significant outcry over the last six months. In the fall of 2023, longstanding chief executive Alan Joyce ended his 15-year career and went into early retirement after a local consumer protection group filed a lawsuit accusing the airline of selling tickets for more than 8,000 flights it 
 during the pandemic.
Customer resentment was exacerbated by the fact that the airline justified rising airfare prices by inflation while continuing to report record profits. Vanessa Hudson, who stepped over from CFO to lead the airline, has since been on a damage-control and reputation-rebuilding mission that has largely not managed to build back the public's trust.
At the start of 2024, a new safety video that the airline intended to be "relatable" was 
 for its 10-minute length even after Qantas clarified that the online version was significantly longer than the in-flight one.
"I know that we have let you down in many ways," Hudson said in an 
 released on Sept. 21. "For that, I am sorry. We haven't delivered the way we should have and we've often been hard to deal with."

The 9.6% return this week takes Qantas Airways' (ASX:QAN) shareholders three-year gains to 14%

By buying an index fund, investors can approximate the average market return. But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. For example, the 
 (
) share price is up 14% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 8.6% (not including dividends).
Since the stock has added AU$851m to its market cap in the past week alone, let's see if underlying performance has been driving long-term returns.
In his essay 
 Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.
Qantas Airways became profitable within the last three years. That would generally be considered a positive, so we'd expect the share price to be up.
You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).
We consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. This 
 interactive report on Qantas Airways' 
 is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.
Qantas Airways shareholders are down 8.8% for the year, but the market itself is up 12%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 1.3%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified 
 that you should be aware of.
There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do 
 want to miss this

Australia's Qantas probing reports of data breach at loyalty app

(Reuters) -Australia's Qantas Airways said on Wednesday it was investigating issues impacting its frequent flyer application, after media reports suggested there was a data breach allowing users access to other passengers' travel information.
Multiple local media outlets, citing Qantas customers, are reporting that some users can see strangers' full travel information, with at least one user being able to cancel someone else's tickets.
"We're urgently working to resolve the issue impacting the Qantas app this morning," the carrier said in a statement on its website.
"We're investigating whether this issue may have been caused by recent system changes."
Qantas did not provide any further information about the issue in its statement. It did not provide any details of the reported data breach when Reuters reached out separately.

Qantas to Pay Civil Penalty for Selling Tickets on Canceled Flights

Australia’s major airline will pay a civil penalty of $66.1 million to resolve court proceedings with a regulator which alleged the airline had advertised tickets for more than 8,000 flights it had already canceled.
================================================================================

Australia's Qantas to pay $79 million to settle flight cancellation case

By Byron Kaye and Poonam Behura
SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia's Qantas Airways agreed to pay A$120 million ($79 million) to settle a regulator lawsuit over the sale of thousands of tickets on already cancelled flights, in an attempt to end a reputational crisis that has engulfed the airline.
The company will split A$20 million between more than 86,000 customers who booked tickets on the so-called "ghost flights" and pay a A$100 million fine instead of defending the lawsuit that it had previously vowed to fight, Qantas and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said on Monday.
The fine is the biggest ever for an Australian airline and among the largest globally in the sector, although some Australian banks and casino operators have faced higher penalties for breaches of the law.
"We recognise Qantas let down customers and fell short of our own standards," CEO Vanessa Hudson said in a statement.
The settlement "means we can compensate affected customers much sooner than if the case had continued in the Federal Court", added Hudson, who started her role in September, noting the court still must sign off on the settlement.
If the court approves, the settlement will resolve a dispute that had featured prominently at a time when Qantas's brand value tanked in consumer surveys amid a spike in complaints about cancellations. After the ACCC filed its lawsuit last August, Hudson's longserving predecessor, Alan Joyce, brought forward his retirement.
"This penalty ... will send a strong deterrence message to other companies," ACCC Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said in a statement.
The payout, however, would pale against the A$1.47 billion net profit that analysts on average forecast Qantas to report in the year to end-June, according to LSEG data. People who bought tickets on non-existent domestic flights would get A$225 and people with international fares would get A$450, on top of a refund, the airline and regulator said.
Qantas shares were flat in late trading, against a 0.6% gain in the broader Australian market.
"We see today's outcome as incremental positive, removing another post-COVID brand and valuation overhang from the stock," RBC Capital Markets analyst Owen Birrell said in a client note.
Qantas is still waiting to learn how much it must pay nearly 1,700 ground handling staff it sacked in 2020 after a court found the job cuts were illegal since they were intended to stop industrial action.
The ACCC lawsuit centred on the months after Australia's border reopened in 2022 following two years of COVID restrictions, and airline cancellations and lost luggage complaints spiked globally amid staffing shortages.
Qantas had argued that it faced similar challenges to airlines around the world, but the ACCC said its actions broke consumer law. It had said the airline sometimes sold tickets to flights weeks after they were cancelled.
The ACCC's Cass-Gottlieb noted that the settlement included a promise from Qantas not to repeat the conduct.

Qantas agrees to pay $79 million in compensation and a fine for selling seats on canceled flights

CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Qantas Airways agreed to pay 120 million Australian dollars ($79 million) in compensation and a fine for selling tickets on 
, the airline and Australia’s consumer watchdog said on Monday.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission sued the Sydney-based airline in the Federal Court last year. The commission alleged that Qantas engaged in false, misleading or deceptive conduct by advertising tickets for more than 8,000 flights from May 2021 through to July 2022 that had already been canceled.
Qantas agreed to settle the suit by paying a AU$100 million ($66 million) fine to the Australian government and a projected AU$20 million ($13 million) to more than 86,000 affected customers.
“Today represents another important step forward as we work towards restoring confidence in the national carrier,” Qantas chief executive 
 said in a statement.
“When flying resumed after the COVID shutdown, we recognize Qantas let down customers and fell short of our own standards. We know many of our customers were affected by our failure to provide cancellation notifications in a timely manner and we are sincerely sorry,” said Hudson, who replaced Alan Joyce at the airline’s helm in November last year.
A Federal Court judge has yet to accept the settlement.
ACCC chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said Qantas’ payments of AU$225 ($149) to domestic ticket holders and AU$450 ($298) for international bookings were in addition to other remedies already provided by Qantas, including alternative flights and refunds.
“We are pleased to have secured these admissions by Qantas that it misled its customers, and its agreement that a very significant penalty is required as a result of this conduct,” Cass-Gottlieb said in a statement.
“Qantas’ conduct was egregious and unacceptable. Many consumers will have made holiday, business and travel plans after booking on a phantom flight that had been cancelled,” she added.
Qantas also admitted its misconduct continued until August last year, more than a year longer than the regulator has alleged in court, Cass-Gottlieb said.
The regulator initiated the suit a week after Qantas posted a record profit for the 
 that ended June 30, 2023, following years of losses due to the pandemic.
Its underlying profit for 2022/23 before tax was AU$2.47 billion ($1.6 billion), compared to a AU$1.86 billion ($1.2 billion) loss in the previous year.
Qantas reported a profit of AU$1.74 billion ($1.13 billion) after taxes for the latest year.

Airline to pay £53m settlement over selling tickets for cancelled flights

Qantas is to pay a A$100m (£53m) penalty and A$20m in compensation to passengers to settle a legal battle 
The fine from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is the biggest ever for an Australian airline and among the largest globally in the sector.
The ACCC sued Qantas last summer, claiming the carrier broke consumer law when it sold tickets to more than 8,000 flights without disclosing they had been cancelled.
In one particular case, Qantas kept selling tickets for a Sydney to San Francisco flight for 40 days after it had been cancelled, the regulator said.
Gina Cass-Gottlieb, chair of the ACCC, said “Qantas’ conduct was egregious and unacceptable”.
She added: “Many consumers will have made holiday, business and travel plans after booking on a phantom flight that had been cancelled.
“We expect that this penalty, if accepted by the Court, will send a strong deterrence message to other companies.
“Importantly, it demonstrates that we take action to ensure that companies operating in Australia communicate clearly, accurately and honestly with their customers at all times.”
Qantas’s “ghost flight” debacle fuelled a national scandal about the performance of Australia’s flag carrier. Customer satisfaction with the airline has plummeted.
Vanessa Hudson, chief executive of the airline, said the agreement represents “another important step forward as we work towards restoring confidence in the national carrier”.
She said the pandemic was to blame for some of the administrative failings.
Ms Hudson said: “When flying resumed after the Covid shutdown, we recognise Qantas let down customers and fell short of our own standards. We know many of our customers were affected by our failure to provide cancellation notifications in a timely manner and we are sincerely sorry.
“The return to travelling was already stressful for many and we did not deliver enough support for customers and did not have the technology and systems in place to support our people.”
More than 86,000 customers will share the compensation pot, with those who bought domestic tickets entitled to $225 apiece and international travellers entitled to $450.
The tickets were sold by the Australian airline between May 2021 and August 2023. Qantas has promised to contact all affected customers over the next two months.
The ACCC warned that scammers were contacting people who are potentially eligible for compensation.

Goldman Sachs adds these stocks to its 2024 APAC “conviction list”

Investing.com-- Goldman Sachs analysts added five stocks from across the Asia Pacific region to its list of favored stocks for 2024, citing tailwinds from a mix of improving Chinese consumer demand, a clean energy transition and artificial intelligence.
GS said it had added ANTA Sports Products Ltd (HK:2020), Hong Kong Exchange and Clearing Ltd (HK:0388), Thai Oil PCL (BK:TOP), Qantas Airways Ltd (ASX:QAN) and Elite Material Co Ltd (TW:2383) to its APAC Conviction list- a listof 29 Asian stocks on which the brokerage holds Buy recommendations and expects outperformance.
China’s Anta Sports is expected to benefit from improving consumer demand, while its multi-brand strategy also allows it to better capture mass-market demand, GS analysts said.
HKEX, which operates the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, is set to clock improved earnings tracking a recovery in cash market trading value, and is also expected to benefit from improved policy support as the government widens the Connect program with the mainland.
Thai Oil is forecast to see stronger earnings from its clean fuel project, which is likely to increase capacity and refining margins, while increased cash generation for the firm could also potentially improve shareholder returns.
Qantas is expected to catch up with its peers in valuation, especially as earnings recover to above pre-COVID levels, and as the firm shows more signs of shareholder returns and upgrading its fleet.
Taiwan’s Elite Material is expected to benefit greatly from high exposure to the fast-growing AI server market, with GS analysts touting the firm’s product quality and “best-in-class” mass production capabilities.
On the other hand GS removed South Korean entertainment giant HYBE (KS:352820), Japanese banking giant Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Financial Group Inc (TYO:8306), and Chinese clothing maker Shenzhou International Group Holdings Ltd (HK:2313) from the conviction list, as all three stocks underperformed after being added to the list in January and December.

UPDATE 3-Australia's Qantas to suspend Shanghai flights on low demand

(Adds Australian tourism group comment in paragraphs 6-7)
May 14 (Reuters) - Qantas Airways said on Tuesday it will suspend flights to Shanghai starting on July 28, citing low demand, nine months after the Australian flag carrier resumed service from Sydney on hopes of a travel rebound following the pandemic.
International flight numbers to and from China are about 70% of pre-pandemic levels and have been slower to recover than in other markets because of fewer tourists and a domestic economic slowdown.
"Since COVID, the demand for travel between Australia and China has not recovered as strongly as expected. In some months, our flights to and from Shanghai have been operating around half-full," Qantas International CEO Cam Wallace said.
Qantas aircraft on the Shanghai route will be redirected to other destinations across Asia with higher demand or new tourism opportunities, the company said.
Qantas will continue to monitor the Australia-China market closely and return to Shanghai when demand has recovered, the carrier added.
"Since borders reopened, Chinese visitors have been slow to return to Australia, despite aviation capacity increasing," said Margy Osmond, CEO of industry group Tourism & Transport Forum Australia.
She said arrivals from China, now the fourth-largest source of international visitors to Australia, were in March at just 47% of the pre-pandemic levels seen in March 2019. Before COVID-19, China was Australia's top tourism market.
Qantas still flies to Hong Kong from Sydney and Melbourne, and has partnerships with other airlines for onward travel within China.
The carrier announced a new route from Brisbane to Manila starting in late October, as well as additional flights to Singapore. It will also increase its flight frequency from Sydney to Bengaluru.
China's aviation regulator has said it expects international flights to return to 80% of pre-COVID levels by the end of 2024.
China's domestic flight capacity recovered faster, surging past 2019 levels in early 2023 soon after the country lifted travel restrictions.
U.S.-China flights have seen the slowest recovery but are increasing, with services at 16.5% of pre-pandemic levels, the International Air Transport Association said this month.

Investors Shouldn't Overlook Qantas Airways' (ASX:QAN) Impressive Returns On Capital

Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics. Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing 
 on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's 
 of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. With that in mind, the ROCE of 
 (
) looks great, so lets see what the trend can tell us.
For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Qantas Airways is:
0.30 = AU$2.5b ÷ (AU$19b - AU$11b) 
.
Thus, 
 That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 8.8% earned by companies in a similar industry.
Above you can see how the current ROCE for Qantas Airways compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our 
.
You'd find it hard not to be impressed with the ROCE trend at Qantas Airways. The figures show that over the last five years, returns on capital have grown by 139%. That's not bad because this tells for every dollar invested (capital employed), the company is increasing the amount earned from that dollar. In regards to capital employed, Qantas Airways appears to been achieving more with less, since the business is using 22% less capital to run its operation. Qantas Airways may be selling some assets so it's worth investigating if the business has plans for future investments to increase returns further still.
On a side note, we noticed that the improvement in ROCE appears to be partly fueled by an increase in current liabilities. The current liabilities has increased to 57% of total assets, so the business is now more funded by the likes of its suppliers or short-term creditors. And with current liabilities at those levels, that's pretty high.
From what we've seen above, Qantas Airways has managed to increase it's returns on capital all the while reducing it's capital base. Investors may not be impressed by the favorable underlying trends yet because over the last five years the stock has only returned 17% to shareholders. Given that, we'd look further into this stock in case it has more traits that could make it multiply in the long term.
Qantas Airways does come with some risks though, we found
and 1 of those is a bit concerning...

Qantas CEO: ‘We let our customers down’ on canceled flights scandal

The boss of Qantas Airways has acknowledged the “anger” of thousands of customers who were sold tickets for already-canceled flights.
“Everyone feels pain at the anger,” Qantas CEO Vanessa Hudson told CNN’s Richard Quest in an exclusive interview at an airline industry conference in Dubai Monday. “It’s not just me; (it’s) 25,000 people that work for us as well. Because not only (did) we let our customers down, we let our people down.”
Last August, Australian regulators accused Qantas in a lawsuit of selling tickets for more than 8,000 flights that the airline had already canceled — affecting more than 86,000 customers.
Qantas 
 last month to pay 120 million Australian dollars ($79 million) to settle the lawsuit. Of that, about 20 million Australian dollars ($13.3 million) will go to the affected customers.
The remaining 100 million Australian dollars ($66.5 million) is a fine — the biggest ever for an Australian airline, according to 
.
Hudson, who took the helm at Qantas in September, soon after the lawsuit was filed, told Quest the airline is focused on repairing its relationships with passengers and staff.
She has “spent a lot of time listening” to the concerns of customers and staff, she said. The airline is investing in improving the in-flight experience, including the food it serves and the Wi-Fi service it offers.
Qantas has since seen a “customer satisfaction rebound,” Hudson said, though she did not elaborate.

Qantas to buy remaining 49% stake in TripADeal for $140.6 million

(Reuters) -Australia's Qantas Airways said on Thursday it will acquire the remaining 49% stake in online travel business TripADeal for A$211 million ($140.6 million) as the airline seeks to capitalize on strong demand for holiday bookings.
Easing travel restrictions following the pandemic and higher demand for holidays has boosted online travel bookings.
The deal will enable the group to deepen synergies by combining Qantas and partner airline Jetstar's network with the growing curated tour market, Qantas said.
Qantas acquired a majority stake in TripADeal in 2022.
Following the deal to buy the remaining stake in TripADeal, expected to be completed by the end of June 2024, Qantas expects combined cost and revenue synergies of at least A$50 million annually across the group.
TripADeal will continue to operate as an independent business following the acquisition, working with a range of travel partners and airlines, Qantas said.

Air travel around the world was disrupted by a major tech-service outage Friday, with airlines canceling and rerouting flights and airports reporting issues checking in passengers. The biggest U.S. carriers, including **Delta Air Lines**, **United Airlines** and **American Airlines** grounded flights, according to an advisory from the Federal Aviation Administration. More than 21,000 flights around the world were delayed by mid-morning Friday, according to flight-tracking website FlightAware.

Australia airline Rex cuts jobs, cancels flights after calling in administrators

By Lewis Jackson and Lisa Barrington
SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australian airline Regional Express Holdings will cut hundreds of job after it entered voluntary administration, the second small airline to do so this year, in a move that will further concentrate the country's aviation market.
Traditionally focused on servicing Australia's vast regional areas with small planes, Rex in 2021 began larger jet flights in the lucrative "golden triangle" between Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne, which is dominated by Qantas Airways and Virgin Australia.
However the airline failed to meaningfully dent their control of the overall market, which was over 90% in March, according to the competition regulator. On Tuesday, Rex called in administrators Ernst & Young.
The administrators will shutter the subsidiary which operates Rex's Boeing 737 flights between major cities and make 360 workers redundant, according to the Transport Workers Union (TWU). A further 250 jobs will be cut elsewhere, it said.
Regional flights on its fleet of Saab 340 aircraft will continue.
Rex investor and private equity group PAG Asia Capital has provided bridging finance to help keep regional flights running, according to a source not authorised to speak with media.
PAG, which has one board seat, helped bankroll Rex's expansion into major cities in 2021 with a A$150 million convertible bond.
PAG declined to comment.
Transport Minister Catherine King said the government had provided Rex some support to keep its regional flights in the air but stopped short of guaranteeing a rescue package.
"I think it is fair to say that we would be reluctant to just throw money at the problem," she said. "What we would want to do is ensure that there is a long term solution to the security of regional aviation."
AVIATION REFORM
The collapse, which comes only three months after budget airline Bonza closed down, is likely to put a spotlight on the barriers smaller airlines face breaking into the vast, sparsely populated market dominated by Qantas and Virgin.
In March 62% of domestic passengers were carried by Qantas and subsidiary Jetstar, 31% by Virgin Australia, 5% by Rex and 2% by Bonza, according to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).
The regulator has previously said Bonza and Rex presented opportunities for a more competitive domestic industry.
Adrian Schofield, an analyst at CAPA Centre for Aviation, said both Bonza and Rex's jet operations were too small to be really competitive.
"They weren't able to grow their fleets quickly enough to generate efficiencies of scale required to produce the kind of revenues and profit needed for their parent companies to continue to support them," Schofield said.
The ACCC has called on the government to reform how airlines are allocated flight slots, especially on busy state capital journeys, where critics have argued that Qantas and Virgin's control of profitable routes keeps out new entrants.
The company which administers flight slots is majority owned by the two airlines, which reject the accusation.
The regulator said in May that Rex needed a larger fleet and more slots at Sydney airport to grow to the point where it could meaningfully compete with Qantas and Virgin.
In February the government announced reforms to slot management at Sydney airport, including greater reporting requirements. A government review into the aviation sector is due later this year.
AVIATION DEMAND
While slot availability at Sydney airport was an issue, Rex's failure also comes down to a general slowdown in aviation as leisure travellers cut back, according to Morningstar analyst Angus Hewitt.
Aviation saw high demand and fares as aviation bounced back from the pandemic, but airlines globally are seeing a weaker-than-expected quarter due to costs and falling revenue per passenger because of pressure on ticket prices.
Virgin, which had flight slots at Sydney, had not reported an underlying profit since 2012 when it filed for bankruptcy in 2020, Hewitt added.

Qantas adjusting schedule as pilots at units plan another strike

(Reuters) -Qantas Airways , Australia's flag carrier, said on Monday that it is adjusting its schedule for a couple of days this week to mitigate any operational disruptions arising from a new planned strike by the pilots at its units.
The airline expects that most customers will reach their destinations on the same day as their bookings, utilising a mix of Qantas-owned and third-party aircraft.
Pilots at Network Aviation and QantasLink units will begin a new strike this week, as they persist in demanding higher pay, the Australian Federation of Air Pilots (AFAP) said in a statement on Monday.
The pilot groups are attempting to negotiate a new enterprise deal to replace the Network Aviation Pilots Enterprise Agreement 2016, which expired in October 2020.
Pilots at QantasLink and Network Aviation are set to halt work on Thursday and Friday, the AFAP said.
A hearing between the parties is also scheduled at Australia's Fair Work Commission on March 14 and 15, aiming to reach a settlement over a dispute that has persisted for nearly two years.
The union and the airline have been negotiating for over 18 months, during which the pilots have rejected three deals, including an offer of a pay increase of more than 25% and subsequent 3% annual increases.
The AFAP represents 95% of the commercial pilots employed by Qantas Group subsidiary Network Aviation, responsible for flying both passenger transport under QantasLink and fly-in fly-out (FIFO) as well as private charter aircraft under Network Aviation in Western Australia.

One more airline cracks down on lounge crowding in a way you won't like

Over the last two years, multiple airlines have 
 in their lounges. While they are designed as a luxury experience for a small subset of travelers, high numbers of people taking a trip post-pandemic as well as the different ways they are able to gain access through status or certain credit cards made it difficult for some airlines to 
 keeping foods stocked, common areas clean and having enough staff to serve bar drinks at the rate that customers expect them.
In the fall of 2023, Delta Air Lines 
 caught serious traveler outcry after announcing that it was 
on crowding by raising how much one needs to spend for lounge access and limiting the number of times one can enter those lounges.
Some airlines saw the outcry with Delta as their chance to reassure customers that they would not raise their fees while others waited for the storm to pass to quietly implement their own increases.
Australia's flagship carrier Qantas Airways 
 is the latest airline to announce that it would raise the cost accessing the 24 lounges across the country as well as the 600 international lounges available at airports across the world through partner airlines.
Unlike other airlines which grant access primarily after reaching frequent flyer status, Qantas also sells it through a membership — starting from April 18, 2024, prices will rise from $600 Australian dollars ($392 USD)  to $699 AUD ($456 USD) for one year, $1,100 ($718 USD) to $1,299 ($848 USD) for two years and $2,000 AUD ($1,304) to lock in the rate for four years.
Those signing up for lounge access for the first time also currently pay a joining fee of $99 AUD ($65 USD) that will rise to $129 AUD ($85 USD).
The airline also allows customers to purchase their membership with Qantas Points they collect through frequent travel; the membership fees are also being raised by the equivalent amount in points in what adds up to as much as 17% — from 308,000 to 399,900 to lock in access for four years.
"This is the first time the Qantas Club membership fees have increased in seven years and will help cover cost increases passed on from a range of suppliers over that time," a Qantas spokesperson confirmed to Simple Flying. "This follows a reduction in the membership fees for several years during the pandemic."
The spokesperson said the gains from the increases will go both towards making up for inflation-related costs and keeping existing lounges looking modern by updating features like furniture and décor.
While the price increases also do not apply for those who earned lounge access through frequent flyer status or change what it takes to earn that status, Qantas is also introducing even steeper increases for those renewing a membership or adding additional features such as spouse and partner memberships.
In some cases, the cost of these features will nearly double from what members are paying now.

What Is Qantas Airways Limited's (ASX:QAN) Share Price Doing?

Qantas Airways Limited (
), is not the largest company out there, but it saw significant share price movement during recent months on the ASX, rising to highs of AU$5.83 and falling to the lows of AU$5.01. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Qantas Airways' current trading price of AU$5.29 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Qantas Airways’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.
Great news for investors – Qantas Airways is still trading at a fairly cheap price according to our price multiple model, where we compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. We’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 5.46x is currently well-below the industry average of 8.48x, meaning that it is trading at a cheaper price relative to its peers. What’s more interesting is that, Qantas Airways’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.
Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of Qantas Airways, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting earnings growth of 3.1%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term.
 Even though growth is relatively muted, since QAN is currently trading below the industry PE ratio, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current price multiple.
 If you’ve been keeping an eye on QAN for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its future profit outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy QAN. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.
If you'd like to know more about Qantas Airways as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing. To help with this, we've discovered 
 (1 shouldn't be ignored!) that you ought to be aware of before buying any shares in Qantas Airways.

Australia's Qantas to pay $79 million to settle flight cancellation case

By Byron Kaye and Poonam Behura
SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia's Qantas Airways agreed to pay A$120 million ($79 million) to settle a regulator lawsuit over the sale of thousands of tickets on already cancelled flights, in an attempt to end a reputational crisis that has engulfed the airline.
The company will split A$20 million between more than 86,000 customers who booked tickets on the so-called "ghost flights" and pay a A$100 million fine instead of defending the lawsuit that it had previously vowed to fight, Qantas and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said on Monday.
The fine is the biggest ever for an Australian airline and among the largest globally in the sector, although some Australian banks and casino operators have faced higher penalties for breaches of the law.
"We recognise Qantas let down customers and fell short of our own standards," CEO Vanessa Hudson said in a statement.
The settlement "means we can compensate affected customers much sooner than if the case had continued in the Federal Court", added Hudson, who started her role in September, noting the court still must sign off on the settlement.
If the court approves, the settlement will resolve a dispute that had featured prominently at a time when Qantas's brand value tanked in consumer surveys amid a spike in complaints about cancellations. After the ACCC filed its lawsuit last August, Hudson's longserving predecessor, Alan Joyce, brought forward his retirement.
"This penalty ... will send a strong deterrence message to other companies," ACCC Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said in a statement.
The payout, however, would pale against the A$1.47 billion net profit that analysts on average forecast Qantas to report in the year to end-June, according to LSEG data. People who bought tickets on non-existent domestic flights would get A$225 and people with international fares would get A$450, on top of a refund, the airline and regulator said.
Qantas shares were flat in late trading, against a 0.6% gain in the broader Australian market.
"We see today's outcome as incremental positive, removing another post-COVID brand and valuation overhang from the stock," RBC Capital Markets analyst Owen Birrell said in a client note.
Qantas is still waiting to learn how much it must pay nearly 1,700 ground handling staff it sacked in 2020 after a court found the job cuts were illegal since they were intended to stop industrial action.
The ACCC lawsuit centred on the months after Australia's border reopened in 2022 following two years of COVID restrictions, and airline cancellations and lost luggage complaints spiked globally amid staffing shortages.
Qantas had argued that it faced similar challenges to airlines around the world, but the ACCC said its actions broke consumer law. It had said the airline sometimes sold tickets to flights weeks after they were cancelled.
The ACCC's Cass-Gottlieb noted that the settlement included a promise from Qantas not to repeat the conduct.

The 9.6% return this week takes Qantas Airways' (ASX:QAN) shareholders three-year gains to 14%

By buying an index fund, investors can approximate the average market return. But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. For example, the 
 (
) share price is up 14% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 8.6% (not including dividends).
Since the stock has added AU$851m to its market cap in the past week alone, let's see if underlying performance has been driving long-term returns.
In his essay 
 Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.
Qantas Airways became profitable within the last three years. That would generally be considered a positive, so we'd expect the share price to be up.
You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).
We consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. This 
 interactive report on Qantas Airways' 
 is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.
Qantas Airways shareholders are down 8.8% for the year, but the market itself is up 12%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 1.3%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified 
 that you should be aware of.
There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do

Australia's Qantas probing reports of data breach at loyalty app

(Reuters) -Australia's Qantas Airways said on Wednesday it was investigating issues impacting its frequent flyer application, after media reports suggested there was a data breach allowing users access to other passengers' travel information.
Multiple local media outlets, citing Qantas customers, are reporting that some users can see strangers' full travel information, with at least one user being able to cancel someone else's tickets.
"We're urgently working to resolve the issue impacting the Qantas app this morning," the carrier said in a statement on its website.
"We're investigating whether this issue may have been caused by recent system changes."
Qantas did not provide any further information about the issue in its statement. It did not provide any details of the reported data breach when Reuters reached out separately.

Qantas to Pay Civil Penalty for Selling Tickets on Canceled Flights

Australia’s major airline will pay a civil penalty of $66.1 million to resolve court proceedings with a regulator which alleged the airline had advertised tickets for more than 8,000 flights it had already canceled.

An airline launched a sale so low it crashed its website

With the average airplane fare 
 from 2021 to 2024, it is not surprising that many people get excited when 
 come around.
Japan Airlines 
 and Cathay Pacific 
 both saw their websites temporarily go down after
 at different points last year.
The latest airline that had this happen is Jetstar, the budget offshoot of Australia's flagship airline Qantas Airways 
. As part of celebrating the fact that it was turning 20 years old this spring, Jetstar launched a sale in which some domestic routes across Australia could be bought for 29 Australian dollars ($19 USD) and less than $100 to nearby international destinations such as Bali.
The $29 is a specific nod to the cost of many of the domestic routes when Jetstar was founded in 2004. The lowest fares are limited to flights from Brisbane to Newcastle, Adelaide to Brisbane, Perth to the Gold Coast and Sydney to Byron Bay.
While the sale was launched on May 3 and was supposed to last five days, many of the available seats were snapped up within hours and the airline's website ended up crashing. Many Australians who were trying to make a purchase reported seeing a pop-up reading that Jetstar is "very busy right now and something has gone wrong — we are very sorry."
"What's the point of having a sale when you can't even get onto the page," reads one of the comments on the Instagram 
 post announcing the 20-year celebration.
"It's actually not working," reads another.
Jetstar had earlier told its online followers to "stay tuned for a big month of Birthday celebrations" but has not been responding to questions on whether the seats it had slated for the sale had sold out or more low fares would drop later.
While Jetstar has not been as heavily scrutinized as its parent company, Qantas Airways has been the source of significant outcry over the last six months. In the fall of 2023, longstanding chief executive Alan Joyce ended his 15-year career and went into early retirement after a local consumer protection group filed a lawsuit accusing the airline of selling tickets for more than 8,000 flights it 
 during the pandemic.
Customer resentment was exacerbated by the fact that the airline justified rising airfare prices by inflation while continuing to report record profits. Vanessa Hudson, who stepped over from CFO to lead the airline, has since been on a damage-control and reputation-rebuilding mission that has largely not managed to build back the public's trust.
At the start of 2024, a new safety video that the airline intended to be "relatable" was 
 for its 10-minute length even after Qantas clarified that the online version was significantly longer than the in-flight one.
"I know that we have let you down in many ways," Hudson said in an 
 released on Sept. 21. "For that, I am sorry. We haven't delivered the way we should have and we've often been hard to deal with."

Australia's Qantas Airways expands frequent flyer loyalty programme

(Reuters) - Qantas Airways expanded its frequent flyer programme on Monday, offering access to 20 million more reward seats that can be purchased through points, as the Australian carrier plans to spend more on customers in a bid to fix its battered reputation.
The points required to book the airline's new "Classic Plus" reward seats will be more than its existing "Classic" seats and will vary like normal air fares, meaning they will be lower during off-peak periods or when booking early.
The company had one of its most reputationally damaging years in 2023, as it defended a competition regulator lawsuit over selling tickets to already-cancelled flights and as a court found the airline sacked 1,700 ground staff illegally in 2020.
Qantas has since promised to focus more on customer benefits and engagement, and expects to invest A$120 million ($78.74 million) in fiscal 2025 for the new program. It also expects the benefits from the program to outweigh the cost of investment in the first half of fiscal 2026.
The carrier added it expects the Qantas Loyalty division to deliver underlying earnings before interests and taxes between A$500 million and A$525 million in FY24.
"On first pass, the change appears to be a modest negative short term including higher investment, lower margin and lower profit," analysts at Citi wrote.
"In time, the hypothesis is this investment would stimulate volumes and earning activity that would outweigh costs, but mechanically would take time (18 months) to play out/prove up," they added.
Qantas said its new reward seats will be available to be booked from Monday across international flights departing from Australia for travel from July 1, and will be available across its full international and domestic network by the end of this year.
The Australian flag carrier also confirmed it would begin a stock buyback of up to A$448 million, which it announced in February and expects to complete by June 30.

Qantas agrees to pay $79 million in compensation and a fine for selling seats on canceled flights

CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Qantas Airways agreed to pay 120 million Australian dollars ($79 million) in compensation and a fine for selling tickets on 
, the airline and Australia’s consumer watchdog said on Monday.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission sued the Sydney-based airline in the Federal Court last year. The commission alleged that Qantas engaged in false, misleading or deceptive conduct by advertising tickets for more than 8,000 flights from May 2021 through to July 2022 that had already been canceled.
Qantas agreed to settle the suit by paying a AU$100 million ($66 million) fine to the Australian government and a projected AU$20 million ($13 million) to more than 86,000 affected customers.
“Today represents another important step forward as we work towards restoring confidence in the national carrier,” Qantas chief executive 
 said in a statement.
“When flying resumed after the COVID shutdown, we recognize Qantas let down customers and fell short of our own standards. We know many of our customers were affected by our failure to provide cancellation notifications in a timely manner and we are sincerely sorry,” said Hudson, who replaced Alan Joyce at the airline’s helm in November last year.
A Federal Court judge has yet to accept the settlement.
ACCC chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said Qantas’ payments of AU$225 ($149) to domestic ticket holders and AU$450 ($298) for international bookings were in addition to other remedies already provided by Qantas, including alternative flights and refunds.
“We are pleased to have secured these admissions by Qantas that it misled its customers, and its agreement that a very significant penalty is required as a result of this conduct,” Cass-Gottlieb said in a statement.
“Qantas’ conduct was egregious and unacceptable. Many consumers will have made holiday, business and travel plans after booking on a phantom flight that had been cancelled,” she added.
Qantas also admitted its misconduct continued until August last year, more than a year longer than the regulator has alleged in court, Cass-Gottlieb said.
The regulator initiated the suit a week after Qantas posted a record profit for the 
 that ended June 30, 2023, following years of losses due to the pandemic.
Its underlying profit for 2022/23 before tax was AU$2.47 billion ($1.6 billion), compared to a AU$1.86 billion ($1.2 billion) loss in the previous year.
Qantas reported a profit of AU$1.74 billion ($1.13 billion) after taxes for the latest year.

Airline to pay £53m settlement over selling tickets for cancelled flights

Qantas is to pay a A$100m (£53m) penalty and A$20m in compensation to passengers to settle a legal battle 
The fine from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is the biggest ever for an Australian airline and among the largest globally in the sector.
The ACCC sued Qantas last summer, claiming the carrier broke consumer law when it sold tickets to more than 8,000 flights without disclosing they had been cancelled.
In one particular case, Qantas kept selling tickets for a Sydney to San Francisco flight for 40 days after it had been cancelled, the regulator said.
Gina Cass-Gottlieb, chair of the ACCC, said “Qantas’ conduct was egregious and unacceptable”.
She added: “Many consumers will have made holiday, business and travel plans after booking on a phantom flight that had been cancelled.
“We expect that this penalty, if accepted by the Court, will send a strong deterrence message to other companies.
“Importantly, it demonstrates that we take action to ensure that companies operating in Australia communicate clearly, accurately and honestly with their customers at all times.”
Qantas’s “ghost flight” debacle fuelled a national scandal about the performance of Australia’s flag carrier. Customer satisfaction with the airline has plummeted.
Vanessa Hudson, chief executive of the airline, said the agreement represents “another important step forward as we work towards restoring confidence in the national carrier”.
She said the pandemic was to blame for some of the administrative failings.
Ms Hudson said: “When flying resumed after the Covid shutdown, we recognise Qantas let down customers and fell short of our own standards. We know many of our customers were affected by our failure to provide cancellation notifications in a timely manner and we are sincerely sorry.
“The return to travelling was already stressful for many and we did not deliver enough support for customers and did not have the technology and systems in place to support our people.”
More than 86,000 customers will share the compensation pot, with those who bought domestic tickets entitled to $225 apiece and international travellers entitled to $450.
The tickets were sold by the Australian airline between May 2021 and August 2023. Qantas has promised to contact all affected customers over the next two months.
The ACCC warned that scammers were contacting people who are potentially eligible for compensation.

UPDATE 3-Australia's Qantas to suspend Shanghai flights on low demand

(Adds Australian tourism group comment in paragraphs 6-7)
May 14 (Reuters) - Qantas Airways said on Tuesday it will suspend flights to Shanghai starting on July 28, citing low demand, nine months after the Australian flag carrier resumed service from Sydney on hopes of a travel rebound following the pandemic.
International flight numbers to and from China are about 70% of pre-pandemic levels and have been slower to recover than in other markets because of fewer tourists and a domestic economic slowdown.
"Since COVID, the demand for travel between Australia and China has not recovered as strongly as expected. In some months, our flights to and from Shanghai have been operating around half-full," Qantas International CEO Cam Wallace said.
Qantas aircraft on the Shanghai route will be redirected to other destinations across Asia with higher demand or new tourism opportunities, the company said.
Qantas will continue to monitor the Australia-China market closely and return to Shanghai when demand has recovered, the carrier added.
"Since borders reopened, Chinese visitors have been slow to return to Australia, despite aviation capacity increasing," said Margy Osmond, CEO of industry group Tourism & Transport Forum Australia.
She said arrivals from China, now the fourth-largest source of international visitors to Australia, were in March at just 47% of the pre-pandemic levels seen in March 2019. Before COVID-19, China was Australia's top tourism market.
Qantas still flies to Hong Kong from Sydney and Melbourne, and has partnerships with other airlines for onward travel within China.
The carrier announced a new route from Brisbane to Manila starting in late October, as well as additional flights to Singapore. It will also increase its flight frequency from Sydney to Bengaluru.
China's aviation regulator has said it expects international flights to return to 80% of pre-COVID levels by the end of 2024.
China's domestic flight capacity recovered faster, surging past 2019 levels in early 2023 soon after the country lifted travel restrictions.
U.S.-China flights have seen the slowest recovery but are increasing, with services at 16.5% of pre-pandemic levels, the International Air Transport Association said this month.

Goldman Sachs adds these stocks to its 2024 APAC “conviction list”

Investing.com-- Goldman Sachs analysts added five stocks from across the Asia Pacific region to its list of favored stocks for 2024, citing tailwinds from a mix of improving Chinese consumer demand, a clean energy transition and artificial intelligence.
GS said it had added ANTA Sports Products Ltd (HK:2020), Hong Kong Exchange and Clearing Ltd (HK:0388), Thai Oil PCL (BK:TOP), Qantas Airways Ltd (ASX:QAN) and Elite Material Co Ltd (TW:2383) to its APAC Conviction list- a listof 29 Asian stocks on which the brokerage holds Buy recommendations and expects outperformance.
China’s Anta Sports is expected to benefit from improving consumer demand, while its multi-brand strategy also allows it to better capture mass-market demand, GS analysts said.
HKEX, which operates the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, is set to clock improved earnings tracking a recovery in cash market trading value, and is also expected to benefit from improved policy support as the government widens the Connect program with the mainland.
Thai Oil is forecast to see stronger earnings from its clean fuel project, which is likely to increase capacity and refining margins, while increased cash generation for the firm could also potentially improve shareholder returns.
Qantas is expected to catch up with its peers in valuation, especially as earnings recover to above pre-COVID levels, and as the firm shows more signs of shareholder returns and upgrading its fleet.
Taiwan’s Elite Material is expected to benefit greatly from high exposure to the fast-growing AI server market, with GS analysts touting the firm’s product quality and “best-in-class” mass production capabilities.
On the other hand GS removed South Korean entertainment giant HYBE (KS:352820), Japanese banking giant Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Financial Group Inc (TYO:8306), and Chinese clothing maker Shenzhou International Group Holdings Ltd (HK:2313) from the conviction list, as all three stocks underperformed after being added to the list in January and December.

Qantas CEO: ‘We let our customers down’ on canceled flights scandal

The boss of Qantas Airways has acknowledged the “anger” of thousands of customers who were sold tickets for already-canceled flights.
“Everyone feels pain at the anger,” Qantas CEO Vanessa Hudson told CNN’s Richard Quest in an exclusive interview at an airline industry conference in Dubai Monday. “It’s not just me; (it’s) 25,000 people that work for us as well. Because not only (did) we let our customers down, we let our people down.”
Last August, Australian regulators accused Qantas in a lawsuit of selling tickets for more than 8,000 flights that the airline had already canceled — affecting more than 86,000 customers.
Qantas 
 last month to pay 120 million Australian dollars ($79 million) to settle the lawsuit. Of that, about 20 million Australian dollars ($13.3 million) will go to the affected customers.
The remaining 100 million Australian dollars ($66.5 million) is a fine — the biggest ever for an Australian airline, according to 
.
Hudson, who took the helm at Qantas in September, soon after the lawsuit was filed, told Quest the airline is focused on repairing its relationships with passengers and staff.
She has “spent a lot of time listening” to the concerns of customers and staff, she said. The airline is investing in improving the in-flight experience, including the food it serves and the Wi-Fi service it offers.
Qantas has since seen a “customer satisfaction rebound,” Hudson said, though she did not elaborate.

Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics. Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing 
 on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's 
 of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. With that in mind, the ROCE of 
 (
) looks great, so lets see what the trend can tell us.
For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Qantas Airways is:
0.30 = AU$2.5b ÷ (AU$19b - AU$11b) 
.
Thus, 
 That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 8.8% earned by companies in a similar industry.
Above you can see how the current ROCE for Qantas Airways compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our 
.
You'd find it hard not to be impressed with the ROCE trend at Qantas Airways. The figures show that over the last five years, returns on capital have grown by 139%. That's not bad because this tells for every dollar invested (capital employed), the company is increasing the amount earned from that dollar. In regards to capital employed, Qantas Airways appears to been achieving more with less, since the business is using 22% less capital to run its operation. Qantas Airways may be selling some assets so it's worth investigating if the business has plans for future investments to increase returns further still.
On a side note, we noticed that the improvement in ROCE appears to be partly fueled by an increase in current liabilities. The current liabilities has increased to 57% of total assets, so the business is now more funded by the likes of its suppliers or short-term creditors. And with current liabilities at those levels, that's pretty high.
From what we've seen above, Qantas Airways has managed to increase it's returns on capital all the while reducing it's capital base. Investors may not be impressed by the favorable underlying trends yet because over the last five years the stock has only returned 17% to shareholders. Given that, we'd look further into this stock in case it has more traits that could make it multiply in the long term.
Qantas Airways does come with some risks though, we found
and 1 of those is a bit concerning...

Qantas to buy remaining 49% stake in TripADeal for $140.6 million

(Reuters) -Australia's Qantas Airways said on Thursday it will acquire the remaining 49% stake in online travel business TripADeal for A$211 million ($140.6 million) as the airline seeks to capitalize on strong demand for holiday bookings.
Easing travel restrictions following the pandemic and higher demand for holidays has boosted online travel bookings.
The deal will enable the group to deepen synergies by combining Qantas and partner airline Jetstar's network with the growing curated tour market, Qantas said.
Qantas acquired a majority stake in TripADeal in 2022.
Following the deal to buy the remaining stake in TripADeal, expected to be completed by the end of June 2024, Qantas expects combined cost and revenue synergies of at least A$50 million annually across the group.
TripADeal will continue to operate as an independent business following the acquisition, working with a range of travel partners and airlines, Qantas said.

Australia airline Rex cuts jobs, cancels flights after calling in administrators

By Lewis Jackson and Lisa Barrington
SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australian airline Regional Express Holdings will cut hundreds of job after it entered voluntary administration, the second small airline to do so this year, in a move that will further concentrate the country's aviation market.
Traditionally focused on servicing Australia's vast regional areas with small planes, Rex in 2021 began larger jet flights in the lucrative "golden triangle" between Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne, which is dominated by Qantas Airways and Virgin Australia.
However the airline failed to meaningfully dent their control of the overall market, which was over 90% in March, according to the competition regulator. On Tuesday, Rex called in administrators Ernst & Young.
The administrators will shutter the subsidiary which operates Rex's Boeing 737 flights between major cities and make 360 workers redundant, according to the Transport Workers Union (TWU). A further 250 jobs will be cut elsewhere, it said.
Regional flights on its fleet of Saab 340 aircraft will continue.
Rex investor and private equity group PAG Asia Capital has provided bridging finance to help keep regional flights running, according to a source not authorised to speak with media.
PAG, which has one board seat, helped bankroll Rex's expansion into major cities in 2021 with a A$150 million convertible bond.
PAG declined to comment.
Transport Minister Catherine King said the government had provided Rex some support to keep its regional flights in the air but stopped short of guaranteeing a rescue package.
"I think it is fair to say that we would be reluctant to just throw money at the problem," she said. "What we would want to do is ensure that there is a long term solution to the security of regional aviation."
AVIATION REFORM
The collapse, which comes only three months after budget airline Bonza closed down, is likely to put a spotlight on the barriers smaller airlines face breaking into the vast, sparsely populated market dominated by Qantas and Virgin.
In March 62% of domestic passengers were carried by Qantas and subsidiary Jetstar, 31% by Virgin Australia, 5% by Rex and 2% by Bonza, according to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).
The regulator has previously said Bonza and Rex presented opportunities for a more competitive domestic industry.
Adrian Schofield, an analyst at CAPA Centre for Aviation, said both Bonza and Rex's jet operations were too small to be really competitive.
"They weren't able to grow their fleets quickly enough to generate efficiencies of scale required to produce the kind of revenues and profit needed for their parent companies to continue to support them," Schofield said.
The ACCC has called on the government to reform how airlines are allocated flight slots, especially on busy state capital journeys, where critics have argued that Qantas and Virgin's control of profitable routes keeps out new entrants.
The company which administers flight slots is majority owned by the two airlines, which reject the accusation.
The regulator said in May that Rex needed a larger fleet and more slots at Sydney airport to grow to the point where it could meaningfully compete with Qantas and Virgin.
In February the government announced reforms to slot management at Sydney airport, including greater reporting requirements. A government review into the aviation sector is due later this year.
AVIATION DEMAND
While slot availability at Sydney airport was an issue, Rex's failure also comes down to a general slowdown in aviation as leisure travellers cut back, according to Morningstar analyst Angus Hewitt.
Aviation saw high demand and fares as aviation bounced back from the pandemic, but airlines globally are seeing a weaker-than-expected quarter due to costs and falling revenue per passenger because of pressure on ticket prices.
Virgin, which had flight slots at Sydney, had not reported an underlying profit since 2012 when it filed for bankruptcy in 2020, Hewitt added.
