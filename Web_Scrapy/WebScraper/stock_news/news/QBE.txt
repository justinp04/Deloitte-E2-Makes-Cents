Pass Up On This 11.6% Dividend Stock

In the landscape of Australian dividend stocks, discerning between those that offer sustainable returns and those that may pose a risk to investors is crucial. While a high yield can be enticing, companies experiencing declining dividend growth, such as Platinum Investment Management, warrant a closer examination to determine if their dividends are a reliable source of income or a red flag signaling underlying issues.
We're going to check out one of the best picks from our screener tool and one that could be a dividend trap.
 ★★★★☆☆
 The company is a global insurer and reinsurer, operating across the Australia Pacific, North America, and other international markets with a market capitalization of approximately A$27.11 billion.
 The firm generates its revenues primarily through three key regions: international markets (US$9.56 billion), North America (US$11.12 billion), and the Australia Pacific area (US$5.97 billion).
 3.4%
QBE Insurance Group's recent performance and strategic moves highlight its potential as a dividend stock, despite some volatility in its dividend history. The company reported a significant increase in net income to US$1.355 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, from US$587 million the previous year. This financial upturn is accompanied by an increased final dividend of A$0.48 per share for 2023, up from A$0.30 in 2022, with expectations of mid-single-digit gross written premium growth for 2024. However, it's important to note that QBE's dividends have experienced fluctuations over the past decade and currently trade at a substantial discount to estimated fair value, suggesting potential undervaluation or investor caution regarding its dividend reliability amidst board changes and insider selling concerns.
 ★★☆☆☆☆
 The company is a publicly owned hedge fund sponsor with a market capitalization of approximately A$581.41 million.
 The firm generates its income primarily through funds management, contributing A$198.41 million, alongside a smaller revenue stream from investments and other activities amounting to A$16.62 million.
 11.7%
Platinum Investment Management's recent developments and financial metrics cast shadows on its attractiveness as a dividend stock. Despite an annualized dividend yield around 10%, the company's dividends are not well-supported, evidenced by a high payout ratio of 93.9% and a cash payout ratio of 94.8%. Recent executive board reshuffles, including the stepping down of key directors and the appointment of Jeff Peters as CEO, add to the uncertainty. Furthermore, being dropped from the FTSE All-World Index signals market skepticism about its performance. Coupled with an expected earnings decline of 15.7% over the next three years and unstable dividend payments in the past decade, these factors suggest caution for dividend-focused investors considering Platinum Investment Management.

Exploring Nick Scali And Two Additional Leading Dividend Stocks

Amidst a challenging day for the ASX200, which saw a decline of 1.1 percent across all sectors, and rising living costs impacting households, investors might find solace in dividend stocks that can offer potential income stability. In this context, exploring strong performers like Nick Scali among others becomes particularly relevant as they may provide a cushion against market volatility and economic pressures.
Let's uncover some gems from our specialized screener.
 ★★★★★☆
 Nick Scali Limited operates in the sourcing and retailing of household furniture and related accessories across Australia and New Zealand, with a market capitalization of approximately A$1.26 billion.
 Nick Scali Limited generates its revenue primarily through the retailing of furniture, amounting to A$450.45 million.
 4.5%
Nick Scali Limited, an Australian furniture retailer, has recently completed follow-on equity offerings totaling A$60 million to support its operations and potential growth strategies, including a merger and acquisition call with Anglia Home Furnishings. Despite a dip in half-year sales from A$283.91 million to A$226.63 million and net income decreasing from A$60.57 million to A$43.01 million, the company maintains a stable dividend history with a recent payment of A$0.35 per share. Its dividends are well-covered by earnings with a payout ratio of 67.9% and cash flows with a cash payout ratio of 43.4%, although its dividend yield of 4.49% is lower than the top Australian dividend payers.
 ★★★★☆☆
 QBE Insurance Group Limited is a global insurer and reinsurer, operating across Australia Pacific, North America, and other international markets with a market capitalization of A$26.64 billion.
 QBE Insurance Group Limited generates revenue through its operations in North America (A$11.12 billion), internationally (A$9.56 billion), and the Australia Pacific region (A$5.97 billion).
 3.4%
QBE Insurance Group has seen a notable increase in dividends, declaring a final dividend of A$0.48 per share for 2023, up from A$0.30 in 2022. Despite this growth, the company's dividend track record over the past decade has been inconsistent with occasional significant drops. Financially, QBE is on solid ground with its dividends well-covered by both earnings and cash flows, sporting payout ratios of 48.3% and 44.7% respectively. However, its dividend yield at 3.43% remains below the top quartile of Australian dividend stocks which average around 6.25%. Recent executive changes and inclusion in the S&P/ASX 20 Index could influence future performance and sustainability strategies.
 ★★★★☆☆
 Southern Cross Electrical Engineering Limited, operating in Australia, offers electrical, instrumentation, communication, and maintenance services with a market capitalization of approximately A$323.75 million.
 Southern Cross Electrical Engineering Limited generates its revenue primarily through the provision of electrical services, amounting to A$464.88 million.
 4.1%
Southern Cross Electrical Engineering's dividend sustainability is moderately supported with a payout ratio of 66.5% and cash payout ratio of 78.2%. Despite a history of increasing dividends over the past decade, the company has experienced volatility in its dividend payments. Earnings have grown at an annual rate of 13.3% over the past five years, with forecasts suggesting continued growth at 14.35% per year. However, its current dividend yield stands at 4.07%, which is lower than the top quartile in the Australian market (6.25%). Recent inclusion in the S&P/ASX All Ordinaries and Emerging Companies Indexes may impact visibility and investor interest.

QBE North America Shares Five Key Benefits of Captives in Healthcare Strategies

, 
 /PRNewswire/ -- In the realm of employee benefits, the trend towards self‑funded healthcare is unmistakable, as the regulatory landscape continues to change and healthcare costs continue to escalate. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners estimates that

The Australian stock market has shown robust performance recently, with a 1.1% increase over the last week and a notable 9.4% rise over the past year, alongside forecasts predicting annual earnings growth of 14%. In this context, high-yield dividend stocks can be particularly appealing for investors looking for both income and potential capital appreciation in a growing market.

 7.7%
Ricegrowers has experienced earnings growth of 16.2% annually over the past five years, yet its dividend history is marked by volatility and inconsistency, with payments not steadily increasing during its nine-year dividend history. Despite this, the dividend yield stands at a competitive 7.69%, well above the Australian market average of 6.33%. The dividends are financially sustainable, backed by a cash payout ratio of 43.1% and an earnings payout ratio of 53.9%, indicating good coverage from both profits and cash flows.

3 High-Yielding ASX Dividend Stocks With Yields Starting At 3.4%

Over the past year, the Australian stock market has shown robust growth with a 10% increase, while remaining stable in the last week. In this context of promising market conditions and anticipated annual earnings growth of 14%, investors might consider high-yielding dividend stocks as a potentially attractive component of their investment portfolio.
We're going to check out a few of the best picks from our screener tool.
 ★★★★☆☆
 NRW Holdings Limited offers diversified contract services to the resources and infrastructure sectors in Australia, with a market capitalization of approximately A$1.43 billion.
 NRW Holdings Limited generates its revenue primarily from three segments: Mining (A$1.49 billion), Civil (A$593.62 million), and MET (A$739.07 million).
 4.6%
NRW Holdings has demonstrated a volatile dividend history over the past decade, making its reliability uncertain for consistent income. Despite this, the dividends are currently well-supported, with a payout ratio of 74% and cash payout ratio of 68.6%, indicating that earnings and cash flows adequately cover dividend payments. However, its dividend yield of 4.63% is below the top quartile in the Australian market, which stands at 6.54%. Additionally, while NRW's stock trades at a significant discount to estimated fair value and earnings have shown substantial growth recently, prospective investors might weigh these positives against the backdrop of historical payment instability.
 ★★★★☆☆
 QBE Insurance Group Limited specializes in underwriting general insurance and reinsurance risks across the Australia Pacific, North America, and other international markets, with a market capitalization of approximately A$27.12 billion.
 QBE Insurance Group Limited generates revenue primarily through three geographic segments: Australia Pacific with A$5.97 billion, North America with A$11.12 billion, and International markets contributing A$9.56 billion.
 3.4%
QBE Insurance Group's dividend sustainability is underpinned by a low payout ratio of 48.3% and cash payout ratio of 44.7%, indicating that both earnings and cash flows adequately cover dividends. However, its dividend track record has been unstable, with volatile payments over the past decade. Despite recent earnings growth of 143%, its dividend yield at 3.41% remains below the Australian market's top quartile average of 6.54%. Recent board changes could signal strategic shifts, potentially impacting future dividend policies.
 ★★★★☆☆
 Ricegrowers Limited, operating under the ticker ASX:SGLLV, is a rice food company with activities spanning both Australia and international markets, boasting a market capitalization of approximately A$457.07 million.
 Ricegrowers Limited generates revenue through several segments including Riviana at A$219.12 million, Cop Rice at A$253.52 million, Rice Food at A$115.93 million, Rice Pool at A$487 million, and International Rice at A$821.54 million.
 7.8%
Ricegrowers Limited, while offering a dividend yield of 7.76%, higher than the market's top quartile average, has shown volatility in its dividend payments with significant annual drops over the past nine years. Despite this instability, both earnings and cash flows support current dividend levels with payout ratios at 53.9% and 43.1% respectively. Trading at a substantial discount to estimated fair value and compared to industry peers, the stock presents potential value but carries risks due to its inconsistent dividend history.

 QBE Insurance Group Limited generates revenue through its operations in North America (A$11.12 billion), internationally (A$9.56 billion), and the Australia Pacific (A$5.97 billion).

Charter Hall Group And Two ASX Dividend Stocks To Consider For Your Portfolio

Over the past year, the Australian market has shown a robust increase of 11%, despite remaining flat in the last seven days. In this stable yet growing environment, dividend stocks like Charter Hall Group can be appealing for their potential to provide steady income and benefit from anticipated earnings growth of 13% per annum.
Let's explore several standout options from the results in the screener.

 NRW Holdings Limited generates revenue primarily through three segments: MET, which brought in A$739.07 million, Civil at A$593.62 million, and Mining, contributing A$1.49 billion.
 4.7%
NRW Holdings presents a mixed scenario for dividend investors. With a dividend yield of 4.74%, it falls below the top tier in the Australian market, yet its dividends are adequately covered by both earnings and cash flows, with payout ratios of 74% and 68.6% respectively. However, the company's dividend history has shown volatility over the past decade, despite an annual earnings growth of 15.8%.

The current dividend yield stands at 3.48%, which is below the Australian market's top quartile of 6.54%. Despite this, QBE maintains a healthy payout ratio of 48.3% and a cash payout ratio of 44.7%, indicating that its dividends are well-supported by both earnings and cash flows. Additionally, QBE's earnings have grown by 143% this past year and are projected to increase annually by 6.47%. Recent board changes and a focus on sustainability may influence future governance and operations.

Pass Up On This 11.6% Dividend Stock

In the landscape of Australian dividend stocks, discerning between those that offer sustainable returns and those that may pose a risk to investors is crucial. While a high yield can be enticing, companies experiencing declining dividend growth, such as Platinum Investment Management, warrant a closer examination to determine if their dividends are a reliable source of income or a red flag signaling underlying issues.
We're going to check out one of the best picks from our screener tool and one that could be a dividend trap.
 ★★★★☆☆
 The company is a global insurer and reinsurer, operating across the Australia Pacific, North America, and other international markets with a market capitalization of approximately A$27.11 billion.
 The firm generates its revenues primarily through three key regions: international markets (US$9.56 billion), North America (US$11.12 billion), and the Australia Pacific area (US$5.97 billion).
 3.4%
QBE Insurance Group's recent performance and strategic moves highlight its potential as a dividend stock, despite some volatility in its dividend history. The company reported a significant increase in net income to US$1.355 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, from US$587 million the previous year. This financial upturn is accompanied by an increased final dividend of A$0.48 per share for 2023, up from A$0.30 in 2022, with expectations of mid-single-digit gross written premium growth for 2024. However, it's important to note that QBE's dividends have experienced fluctuations over the past decade and currently trade at a substantial discount to estimated fair value, suggesting potential undervaluation or investor caution regarding its dividend reliability amidst board changes and insider selling concerns.
 ★★☆☆☆☆
 The company is a publicly owned hedge fund sponsor with a market capitalization of approximately A$581.41 million.
 The firm generates its income primarily through funds management, contributing A$198.41 million, alongside a smaller revenue stream from investments and other activities amounting to A$16.62 million.
 11.7%
Platinum Investment Management's recent developments and financial metrics cast shadows on its attractiveness as a dividend stock. Despite an annualized dividend yield around 10%, the company's dividends are not well-supported, evidenced by a high payout ratio of 93.9% and a cash payout ratio of 94.8%. Recent executive board reshuffles, including the stepping down of key directors and the appointment of Jeff Peters as CEO, add to the uncertainty. Furthermore, being dropped from the FTSE All-World Index signals market skepticism about its performance. Coupled with an expected earnings decline of 15.7% over the next three years and unstable dividend payments in the past decade, these factors suggest caution for dividend-focused investors considering Platinum Investment Management.

Exploring Nick Scali And Two Additional Leading Dividend Stocks

Amidst a challenging day for the ASX200, which saw a decline of 1.1 percent across all sectors, and rising living costs impacting households, investors might find solace in dividend stocks that can offer potential income stability. In this context, exploring strong performers like Nick Scali among others becomes particularly relevant as they may provide a cushion against market volatility and economic pressures.
Let's uncover some gems from our specialized screener.
 ★★★★★☆
 Nick Scali Limited operates in the sourcing and retailing of household furniture and related accessories across Australia and New Zealand, with a market capitalization of approximately A$1.26 billion.
 Nick Scali Limited generates its revenue primarily through the retailing of furniture, amounting to A$450.45 million.
 4.5%
Nick Scali Limited, an Australian furniture retailer, has recently completed follow-on equity offerings totaling A$60 million to support its operations and potential growth strategies, including a merger and acquisition call with Anglia Home Furnishings. Despite a dip in half-year sales from A$283.91 million to A$226.63 million and net income decreasing from A$60.57 million to A$43.01 million, the company maintains a stable dividend history with a recent payment of A$0.35 per share. Its dividends are well-covered by earnings with a payout ratio of 67.9% and cash flows with a cash payout ratio of 43.4%, although its dividend yield of 4.49% is lower than the top Australian dividend payers.
 ★★★★☆☆

 3.4%
QBE Insurance Group has seen a notable increase in dividends, declaring a final dividend of A$0.48 per share for 2023, up from A$0.30 in 2022.

Financially, QBE is on solid ground with its dividends well-covered by both earnings and cash flows, sporting payout ratios of 48.3% and 44.7% respectively. However, its dividend yield at 3.43% remains below the top quartile of Australian dividend stocks which average around 6.25%. Recent executive changes and inclusion in the S&P/ASX 20 Index could influence future performance and sustainability strategies.
 ★★★★☆☆

Despite a history of increasing dividends over the past decade, the company has experienced volatility in its dividend payments. Earnings have grown at an annual rate of 13.3% over the past five years, with forecasts suggesting continued growth at 14.35% per year. However, its current dividend yield stands at 4.07%, which is lower than the top quartile in the Australian market (6.25%).

 NRW Holdings Limited offers diversified contract services to the resources and infrastructure sectors in Australia, with a market capitalization of approximately A$1.43 billion.
 NRW Holdings Limited generates its revenue primarily from three segments: Mining (A$1.49 billion), Civil (A$593.62 million), and MET (A$739.07 million).
 4.6%
NRW Holdings has demonstrated a volatile dividend history over the past decade, making its reliability uncertain for consistent income. Despite this, the dividends are currently well-supported, with a payout ratio of 74% and cash payout ratio of 68.6%, indicating that earnings and cash flows adequately cover dividend payments. However, its dividend yield of 4.63% is below the top quartile in the Australian market, which stands at 6.54%. Additionally, while NRW's stock trades at a significant discount to estimated fair value and earnings have shown substantial growth recently, prospective investors might weigh these positives against the backdrop of historical payment instability.
 ★★★★☆☆
 QBE Insurance Group Limited specializes in underwriting general insurance and reinsurance risks across the Australia Pacific, North America, and other international markets, with a market capitalization of approximately A$27.12 billion.
 QBE Insurance Group Limited generates revenue primarily through three geographic segments: Australia Pacific with A$5.97 billion, North America with A$11.12 billion, and International markets contributing A$9.56 billion.
 3.4%
QBE Insurance Group's dividend sustainability is underpinned by a low payout ratio of 48.3% and cash payout ratio of 44.7%, indicating that both earnings and cash flows adequately cover dividends. However, its dividend track record has been unstable, with volatile payments over the past decade. Despite recent earnings growth of 143%, its dividend yield at 3.41% remains below the Australian market's top quartile average of 6.54%. Recent board changes could signal strategic shifts, potentially impacting future dividend policies.
 ★★★★☆☆
 Ricegrowers Limited, operating under the ticker ASX:SGLLV, is a rice food company with activities spanning both Australia and international markets, boasting a market capitalization of approximately A$457.07 million.
 Ricegrowers Limited generates revenue through several segments including Riviana at A$219.12 million, Cop Rice at A$253.52 million, Rice Food at A$115.93 million, Rice Pool at A$487 million, and International Rice at A$821.54 million.
 7.8%
Ricegrowers Limited, while offering a dividend yield of 7.76%, higher than the market's top quartile average, has shown volatility in its dividend payments with significant annual drops over the past nine years. Despite this instability, both earnings and cash flows support current dividend levels with payout ratios at 53.9% and 43.1% respectively. Trading at a substantial discount to estimated fair value and compared to industry peers, the stock presents potential value but carries risks due to its inconsistent dividend history.

Charter Hall Group And Two ASX Dividend Stocks To Consider For Your Portfolio

Over the past year, the Australian market has shown a robust increase of 11%, despite remaining flat in the last seven days. In this stable yet growing environment, dividend stocks like Charter Hall Group can be appealing for their potential to provide steady income and benefit from anticipated earnings growth of 13% per annum.
Let's explore several standout options from the results in the screener.
 ★★★★★☆
 Charter Hall Group, operating in Australia, is a prominent property investment and funds management group with a market capitalization of approximately A$5.26 billion.
 Charter Hall Group generates revenue primarily through funds management, which brought in A$515.60 million, and property investments, contributing A$142.20 million.
 3.9%
Charter Hall Group offers a relatively modest dividend yield of 3.91%, lower than the top quartile of Australian dividend stocks. Despite this, its dividends are well-supported, with a payout ratio of 43.8% and a cash payout ratio of 45.3%, indicating sustainability from both earnings and cash flow perspectives. Dividends have shown stability and growth over the past decade, although profit margins have declined year-over-year from 42.9% to 11.7%. The stock is currently trading at a significant discount to estimated fair value, suggesting potential for valuation adjustment.
 ★★★★☆☆

 NRW Holdings Limited generates revenue primarily through three segments: MET, which brought in A$739.07 million, Civil at A$593.62 million, and Mining, contributing A$1.49 billion.
 4.7%
NRW Holdings presents a mixed scenario for dividend investors. With a dividend yield of 4.74%, it falls below the top tier in the Australian market, yet its dividends are adequately covered by both earnings and cash flows, with payout ratios of 74% and 68.6% respectively. However, the company's dividend history has shown volatility over the past decade, despite an annual earnings growth of 15.8%. Additionally, NRW is trading at a 30.7% discount to its estimated fair value, suggesting potential undervaluation.

Additionally, QBE's earnings have grown by 143% this past year and are projected to increase annually by 6.47%.
