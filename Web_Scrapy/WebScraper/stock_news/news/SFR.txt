With 66% ownership of the shares, Sandfire Resources Limited (ASX:SFR) is heavily dominated by institutional owners

A look at the shareholders of Sandfire Resources Limited (
) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 66% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Sandfire Resources.
Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.
Sandfire Resources already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Sandfire Resources' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Sandfire Resources. The company's largest shareholder is Australian Super Pty Ltd, with ownership of 15%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 5.4% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.1% by the third-largest shareholder.
We also observed that the top 9 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.
Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
We can see that insiders own shares in Sandfire Resources Limited. It is a pretty big company, so it is generally a positive to see some potentially meaningful alignment. In this case, they own around AU$34m worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking 
The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 32% stake in Sandfire Resources. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Be aware that 
, you should know about...
But ultimately 
, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at

South African miners join race to buy Botswana's Khoemacau copper mine -sources

Valuation stumbling block for some bidders

NAIROBI/LONDON, Sept 5 (Reuters) -
At least three South African miners are in the running to buy Botswana's Khoemacau copper mine that is home to one of Africa's largest copper deposits, several sources told Reuters, as growing demand for the metal ensures strong competition for the sought-after asset.
Johannesburg-listed Impala Platinum, Exxaro Resources and Sibanye Stillwater are weighing bids for the copper and silver mine in Botswana, said the sources with knowledge of the matter, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the information.
A number of unnamed Chinese investors, are also on the list of companies interested in Khoemacau Copper Mining operations, one of the sources said.
Impala declined to comment. Exxaro did not immediately respond to emailed questions. Sibanye confirmed its interest.
"We are looking all the time for opportunities and Khoemacau came up on our radar and we have entered into an non-disclosure agreement to try and understand the opportunity better," Sibanye spokesperson James Wellsted told Reuters. "But Khoemacau is a bit more competitive and we are not going to enter into a bidding war that ends up not creating value."
An increase in copper demand for applications from solar panels to electric cars in coming years has prompted miners to scramble for more supplies of the metal.
Copper prices have fallen due to fears of a global slowdown, but longer-term prospects for the metal and a competitive bidding process will make it hard for any of the bidders to strike a bargain, two of the sources said.
Khoemacau's owners - Cupric Canyon LP, a U.S. private equity firm with funds managed by Global Natural Resources Investments (GNRI) and Resource Capital Fund VII LP - said in May they had begun to engage with potential buyers.
The process is expected to take several months and be finalised close to the end of 2023, a Khoemacau spokesperson said.
Diversified miner South32 and Australian rival Sandfire Resources dropped out of the race after the first bidding round due to the mine's high valuation, the two sources said.
Khoemacau may be valued at between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, three banking sources added.
South32's CEO Graham Kerr appeared to balk at the cost during the company's earnings results in August, saying: "That's probably a very competitive process and one that will be a little bit too rich for our blood."
South32 declined to comment further.
Analysts at Citigroup said in a note that while the assets could be valued at $1.8 billion, the investment would be worthwhile for South32 at $1.2 billion.
A spokesperson for Sandfire declined to comment on the process.
Khoemacau is located in the Kalahari Copper Belt, a vast swathe of land that stretches from north-east Botswana to parts of western Namibia.
It produces about 60,000 tons of copper and about 2 million ounces of silver per year. Future output could be ramped up to about 130,000 tons of copper and 5 million ounces of silver per year with additional investments.
Khoemacau's owners are open to either a partnership or an outright sale, one of the sources said.
