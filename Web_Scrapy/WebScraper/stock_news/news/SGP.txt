MD, CEO & Director of Stockland Picks Up 32% More Stock

Those following along with 
 (
) will no doubt be intrigued by the recent purchase of shares by Tarun Gupta, MD, CEO & Director of the company, who spent a stonking AU$868k on stock at an average price of AU$4.21. Aside from being a solid chunk in its own right, the deft move also saw their holding increase by some 32%.
In fact, the recent purchase by MD, CEO & Director Tarun Gupta was not their only acquisition of Stockland shares this year. They previously made an even bigger purchase of AU$1.1m worth of shares at a price of AU$3.74 per share. Although we like to see insider buying, we note that this large purchase was at significantly below the recent price of AU$4.22. While it does suggest insiders consider the stock undervalued at lower prices, this transaction doesn't tell us much about what they think of current prices.
Stockland insiders may have bought shares in the last year, but they didn't sell any. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!
Stockland is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this 
 
Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Our data indicates that Stockland insiders own about AU$10m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). We do generally prefer see higher levels of insider ownership.
It's certainly positive to see the recent insider purchase. And an analysis of the transactions over the last year also gives us confidence. Insiders likely see value in Stockland shares, given these transactions (along with notable insider ownership of the company). In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Stockland. Every company has risks, and we've spotted

Stockland (ASX:SGP) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 51% of the company

To get a sense of who is truly in control of Stockland (
), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 51% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.
Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Stockland.
Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.
We can see that Stockland does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Stockland's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Stockland. Our data shows that BlackRock, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 10% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 9.8% and 8.5% of the stock.
On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.
I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.
Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Stockland in their own names. Keep in mind that it's a big company, and the insiders own AU$11m worth of shares. The absolute value might be more important than the proportional share. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking 
The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 49% stake in Stockland. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.
It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Stockland better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 
 you should know about.

Stockland's (ASX:SGP) investors will be pleased with their 21% return over the last year

If you want to compound wealth in the stock market, you can do so by buying an index fund. But investors can boost returns by picking market-beating companies to own shares in. To wit, the 
 (
) share price is 13% higher than it was a year ago, much better than the market return of around 2.9% (not including dividends) in the same period. So that should have shareholders smiling. On the other hand, longer term shareholders have had a tougher run, with the stock falling 6.0% in three years.
With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.
To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).
During the last year, Stockland actually saw its earnings per share drop 69%.
Given the share price gain, we doubt the market is measuring progress with EPS. Indeed, when EPS is declining but the share price is up, it often means the market is considering other factors.
We haven't seen Stockland increase dividend payments yet, so the yield probably hasn't helped drive the share higher. We don't find the recent revenue growth particularly impressive at a glance, but shareholders could be projecting an uptick.
You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).
It's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. You can see what analysts are predicting for Stockland in this 
 
.
When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between 
 (TSR) and 
. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Stockland's TSR for the last 1 year was 21%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!
We're pleased to report that Stockland shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 21% over one year. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 6% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered

Do Its Financials Have Any Role To Play In Driving Stockland's (ASX:SGP) Stock Up Recently?

Stockland's (ASX:SGP) stock is up by a considerable 10.0% over the past month. Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely to see if they had a hand to play in the recent price move. Specifically, we decided to study 
 ROE in this article.
Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Stockland is:
4.3% = AU$438m ÷ AU$10b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).
The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every A$1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn A$0.04 in profit.
So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or "retains" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.
At first glance, Stockland's ROE doesn't look very promising. We then compared the company's ROE to the broader industry and were disappointed to see that the ROE is lower than the industry average of 6.7%. However, the moderate 16% net income growth seen by Stockland over the past five years is definitely a positive. So, there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.
Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Stockland's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 12% in the same period, which is great to see.
Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is SGP worth today? The 
 helps visualize whether SGP is currently mispriced by the market.
Stockland has a high three-year median payout ratio of 72%. This means that it has only 28% of its income left to reinvest into its business. However, it's not unusual to see a REIT with such a high payout ratio mainly due to statutory requirements. Despite this, the company's earnings grew moderately as we saw above.
Besides, Stockland has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 78% of its profits over the next three years. However, Stockland's ROE is predicted to rise to 7.7% despite there being no anticipated change in its payout ratio.
In total, it does look like Stockland has some positive aspects to its business. Namely, its high earnings growth. We do however feel that the earnings growth number could have been even higher, had the company been reinvesting more of its earnings and paid out less dividends. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

This Stockland Insider Increased Their Holding By 32% Last Year

Looking at 
 (
) insider transactions over the last year, we can see that insiders were net buyers. That is, there were more number of shares purchased by insiders than there were sold.
While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.
Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by MD, CEO & Director Tarun Gupta for AU$868k worth of shares, at about AU$4.21 per share. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at around the current price of AU$4.56. That means they have been optimistic about the company in the past, though they may have changed their mind. If someone buys shares at well below current prices, it's a good sign on balance, but keep in mind they may no longer see value. Happily, the Stockland insider decided to buy shares at close to current prices. Tarun Gupta was the only individual insider to buy shares in the last twelve months.

Stockland is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this 
 
I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Our data indicates that Stockland insiders own about AU$13m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). Whilst better than nothing, we're not overly impressed by these holdings.
There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. On a brighter note, the transactions over the last year are encouraging. Insiders own shares in Stockland and we see no evidence to suggest they are worried about the future. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Every company has risks, and we've spotted

Stockland's (ASX:SGP) large institutional owners must be happy as stock continues to impress, up 3.1% over the past week

To get a sense of who is truly in control of Stockland (
), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 50% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).
Last week’s 3.1% gain means that institutional investors were on the positive end of the spectrum even as the company has shown strong longer-term trends. One-year return to shareholders is currently 28% and last week’s gain was the icing on the cake.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Stockland.
Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.
Stockland already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Stockland, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.
Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Stockland. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is BlackRock, Inc. with 10% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 9.8% and 8.5%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.
On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.
Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.
Our information suggests that Stockland insiders own under 1% of the company. It's a big company, so even a small proportional interest can create alignment between the board and shareholders. In this case insiders own AU$13m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking 
The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 49% stake in Stockland. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.
It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Stockland better, we need to consider many other factors. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 
 (of which 1 doesn't sit too well with us!) you should know about.

Declining Stock and Decent Financials: Is The Market Wrong About Stockland (ASX:SGP)?

Stockland (ASX:SGP) has had a rough week with its share price down 2.8%. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financials over the long term, which in this case look pretty respectable. In this article, we decided to focus on 
 ROE.
Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Stockland is:
2.4% = AU$241m ÷ AU$10b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).
The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each A$1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made A$0.02 in profit.
We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or "retains" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
As you can see, Stockland's ROE looks pretty weak. Even compared to the average industry ROE of 5.4%, the company's ROE is quite dismal. Although, we can see that Stockland saw a modest net income growth of 15% over the past five years. We reckon that there could be other factors at play here. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.
We then performed a comparison between Stockland's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 14% in the same 5-year period.
Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is SGP worth today? The 
 helps visualize whether SGP is currently mispriced by the market.
Stockland seems to be paying out most of its income as dividends judging by its three-year median payout ratio of 74%, meaning the company retains only 26% of its income. However, this is typical for REITs as they are often required by law to distribute most of their earnings. In spite of this, the company was able to grow its earnings by a fair bit, as we saw above.
Additionally, Stockland has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 75%. Regardless, the future ROE for Stockland is predicted to rise to 8.4% despite there being not much change expected in its payout ratio.
On the whole, we do feel that Stockland has some positive attributes. While no doubt its earnings growth is pretty substantial, we do feel that the reinvestment rate is pretty low, meaning, the earnings growth number could have been significantly higher had the company been retaining more of its profits. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

Exploring Bell Financial Group And Two More ASX Stocks Estimated To Be Trading Below Their Value

Over the past year, the Australian stock market has shown robust growth, appreciating by 9.9%, while remaining stable in the last week. In this context of promising earnings forecasts with an expected annual growth of 14%, stocks like Bell Financial Group that are trading below their perceived value present intriguing opportunities for investors seeking potential gains.
Underneath we present a selection of stocks filtered out by our screen
 Bell Financial Group Limited (ASX:BFG) operates in the financial sector, offering services such as broking, online broking, corporate finance, and financial advisory to a diverse client base, with a market capitalization of approximately A$0.44 billion.
 Bell Financial Group generates revenue through four primary channels: retail broking (A$103.58 million), institutional broking (A$50.36 million), financial products and services (A$48.10 million), and technology solutions for trading platforms (A$26.20 million).
 23.6%
Bell Financial Group, priced at A$1.36, is trading significantly below its estimated fair value of A$1.78, marking a 23.6% undervaluation based on discounted cash flow analysis. Despite a low forecasted return on equity of 16.3% in three years, the company's earnings are expected to grow by 26.95% annually, outpacing the Australian market's average growth rate of 13.7%. However, its dividend sustainability is questionable as it is not well covered by earnings or cash flows.
 Lynas Rare Earths Limited operates in the exploration, development, mining, extraction, and processing of rare earth minerals primarily in Australia and Malaysia, with a market capitalization of approximately A$5.66 billion.
 The company generates its revenue primarily from rare earth operations, which amounted to A$604.08 million.
 19.8%
Lynas Rare Earths, currently valued at A$6.06, appears undervalued with a potential fair value of A$7.55, reflecting a 19.8% discrepancy based on discounted cash flow analysis. Despite lower profit margins this year compared to last, the company is poised for substantial growth with earnings expected to increase by 33.22% annually and revenue projected to rise by 28.2% per year—both rates surpassing broader Australian market trends significantly.
 Stockland is a prominent developer specializing in creating connected communities, with a market capitalization of approximately A$10.80 billion.
 The company generates revenue primarily through its Communities and Commercial Property segments, with figures amounting to A$1.77 billion and A$0.81 billion respectively.
 35.6%
Stockland, priced at A$4.53, trades below its estimated fair value of A$7.04, suggesting a significant undervaluation based on discounted cash flow analysis. Expected to outperform with a 22% annual earnings growth over the next three years—higher than the Australian market average of 13.7%. However, its profit margins have declined to 9.1% from last year's 31%, and dividends are poorly supported by cash flows, indicating potential financial stress despite forecasted revenue growth outpacing the market at 7% annually.

Stockland Insider Ups Holding By 32% During Year

Insiders were net buyers of 
 (
) stock during the past year. That is, insiders bought more stock than they sold.
While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.
The MD, CEO & Director Tarun Gupta made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for AU$868k worth of shares at a price of AU$4.21 each. That implies that an insider found the current price of AU$4.60 per share to be enticing. That means they have been optimistic about the company in the past, though they may have changed their mind. If someone buys shares at well below current prices, it's a good sign on balance, but keep in mind they may no longer see value. The good news for Stockland share holders is that an insider was buying at near the current price. The only individual insider to buy over the last year was Tarun Gupta.
You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!

I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. From our data, it seems that Stockland insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about AU$13m. We do generally prefer see higher levels of insider ownership.
The fact that there have been no Stockland insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening. Insiders own shares in Stockland and we see no evidence to suggest they are worried about the future. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Case in point: We've spotted

Stockland (ASX:SGP) shareholders have earned a 28% return over the last year

If you want to compound wealth in the stock market, you can do so by buying an index fund. But one can do better than that by picking better than average stocks (as part of a diversified portfolio). For example, the 
 (
) share price is up 22% in the last 1 year, clearly besting the market return of around 11% (not including dividends). If it can keep that out-performance up over the long term, investors will do very well! Having said that, the longer term returns aren't so impressive, with stock gaining just 8.2% in three years.
Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.
In his essay 
 Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).
During the last year, Stockland actually saw its earnings per share drop 73%.
So we don't think that investors are paying too much attention to EPS. Indeed, when EPS is declining but the share price is up, it often means the market is considering other factors.
We haven't seen Stockland increase dividend payments yet, so the yield probably hasn't helped drive the share higher. It saw it's revenue decline by 7.1% over twelve months. It's fair to say we're a little surprised to see the share price up, and that makes us cautious.
The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).
We like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. This 
 
 should help you form a view on Stockland
When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between 
 (TSR) and 
. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Stockland the TSR over the last 1 year was 28%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the 
 shareholder return.
It's nice to see that Stockland shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 28% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 10% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Stockland better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified 
 that you should be aware of.
There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do

In fact, the recent purchase by MD, CEO & Director Tarun Gupta was not their only acquisition of Stockland shares this year. They previously made an even bigger purchase of AU$1.1m worth of shares at a price of AU$3.74 per share. Although we like to see insider buying, we note that this large purchase was at significantly below the recent price of AU$4.22. While it does suggest insiders consider the stock undervalued at lower prices, this transaction doesn't tell us much about what they think of current prices.

Stockland (ASX:SGP) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 51% of the company

To get a sense of who is truly in control of Stockland (
), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 51% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.
Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Stockland.
Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.
We can see that Stockland does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Stockland's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Stockland. Our data shows that BlackRock, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 10% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 9.8% and 8.5% of the stock.
On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.
I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.
Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Stockland in their own names. Keep in mind that it's a big company, and the insiders own AU$11m worth of shares. The absolute value might be more important than the proportional share. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking 
The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 49% stake in Stockland. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.
It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Stockland better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 
 you should know about.

Stockland's (ASX:SGP) investors will be pleased with their 21% return over the last year

If you want to compound wealth in the stock market, you can do so by buying an index fund. But investors can boost returns by picking market-beating companies to own shares in. To wit, the 
 (
) share price is 13% higher than it was a year ago, much better than the market return of around 2.9% (not including dividends) in the same period. So that should have shareholders smiling. On the other hand, longer term shareholders have had a tougher run, with the stock falling 6.0% in three years.
With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.
To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).
During the last year, Stockland actually saw its earnings per share drop 69%.
Given the share price gain, we doubt the market is measuring progress with EPS. Indeed, when EPS is declining but the share price is up, it often means the market is considering other factors.
We haven't seen Stockland increase dividend payments yet, so the yield probably hasn't helped drive the share higher. We don't find the recent revenue growth particularly impressive at a glance, but shareholders could be projecting an uptick.
You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).
It's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. You can see what analysts are predicting for Stockland in this 
 
.
When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between 
 (TSR) and 
. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Stockland's TSR for the last 1 year was 21%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!
We're pleased to report that Stockland shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 21% over one year. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 6% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered

This Stockland Insider Increased Their Holding By 32% Last Year

Looking at 
 (
) insider transactions over the last year, we can see that insiders were net buyers. That is, there were more number of shares purchased by insiders than there were sold.
While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.
Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by MD, CEO & Director Tarun Gupta for AU$868k worth of shares, at about AU$4.21 per share. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at around the current price of AU$4.56. That means they have been optimistic about the company in the past, though they may have changed their mind. If someone buys shares at well below current prices, it's a good sign on balance, but keep in mind they may no longer see value. Happily, the Stockland insider decided to buy shares at close to current prices. Tarun Gupta was the only individual insider to buy shares in the last twelve months.
You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!
Stockland is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this 
 
I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Our data indicates that Stockland insiders own about AU$13m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). Whilst better than nothing, we're not overly impressed by these holdings.
There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. On a brighter note, the transactions over the last year are encouraging. Insiders own shares in Stockland and we see no evidence to suggest they are worried about the future. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 
 you should know about.

Stockland (ASX:SGP) shareholders have earned a 28% return over the last year

If you want to compound wealth in the stock market, you can do so by buying an index fund. But one can do better than that by picking better than average stocks (as part of a diversified portfolio). For example, the 
 (
) share price is up 22% in the last 1 year, clearly besting the market return of around 11% (not including dividends). If it can keep that out-performance up over the long term, investors will do very well! Having said that, the longer term returns aren't so impressive, with stock gaining just 8.2% in three years.
Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.
In his essay 
 Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).
During the last year, Stockland actually saw its earnings per share drop 73%.
So we don't think that investors are paying too much attention to EPS. Indeed, when EPS is declining but the share price is up, it often means the market is considering other factors.
We haven't seen Stockland increase dividend payments yet, so the yield probably hasn't helped drive the share higher. It saw it's revenue decline by 7.1% over twelve months. It's fair to say we're a little surprised to see the share price up, and that makes us cautious.
The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).
We like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. This 
 
 should help you form a view on Stockland
When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between 
 (TSR) and 
. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Stockland the TSR over the last 1 year was 28%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the 
 shareholder return.
It's nice to see that Stockland shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 28% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 10% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Stockland better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified 
 that you should be aware of.

Stockland's (ASX:SGP) large institutional owners must be happy as stock continues to impress, up 3.1% over the past week

To get a sense of who is truly in control of Stockland (
), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 50% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).
Last week’s 3.1% gain means that institutional investors were on the positive end of the spectrum even as the company has shown strong longer-term trends. One-year return to shareholders is currently 28% and last week’s gain was the icing on the cake.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Stockland.
Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.
Stockland already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Stockland, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.
Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Stockland. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is BlackRock, Inc. with 10% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 9.8% and 8.5%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.
On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.
Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.
Our information suggests that Stockland insiders own under 1% of the company. It's a big company, so even a small proportional interest can create alignment between the board and shareholders. In this case insiders own AU$13m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking 
The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 49% stake in Stockland. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.
It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Stockland better, we need to consider many other factors. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 
 (of which 1 doesn't sit too well with us!) you should know about.

Exploring Bell Financial Group And Two More ASX Stocks Estimated To Be Trading Below Their Value

Over the past year, the Australian stock market has shown robust growth, appreciating by 9.9%, while remaining stable in the last week. In this context of promising earnings forecasts with an expected annual growth of 14%, stocks like Bell Financial Group that are trading below their perceived value present intriguing opportunities for investors seeking potential gains.
Underneath we present a selection of stocks filtered out by our screen
 Bell Financial Group Limited (ASX:BFG) operates in the financial sector, offering services such as broking, online broking, corporate finance, and financial advisory to a diverse client base, with a market capitalization of approximately A$0.44 billion.
 Bell Financial Group generates revenue through four primary channels: retail broking (A$103.58 million), institutional broking (A$50.36 million), financial products and services (A$48.10 million), and technology solutions for trading platforms (A$26.20 million).
 23.6%
Bell Financial Group, priced at A$1.36, is trading significantly below its estimated fair value of A$1.78, marking a 23.6% undervaluation based on discounted cash flow analysis. Despite a low forecasted return on equity of 16.3% in three years, the company's earnings are expected to grow by 26.95% annually, outpacing the Australian market's average growth rate of 13.7%. However, its dividend sustainability is questionable as it is not well covered by earnings or cash flows.
 Lynas Rare Earths Limited operates in the exploration, development, mining, extraction, and processing of rare earth minerals primarily in Australia and Malaysia, with a market capitalization of approximately A$5.66 billion.
 The company generates its revenue primarily from rare earth operations, which amounted to A$604.08 million.
 19.8%
Lynas Rare Earths, currently valued at A$6.06, appears undervalued with a potential fair value of A$7.55, reflecting a 19.8% discrepancy based on discounted cash flow analysis. Despite lower profit margins this year compared to last, the company is poised for substantial growth with earnings expected to increase by 33.22% annually and revenue projected to rise by 28.2% per year—both rates surpassing broader Australian market trends significantly.
 Stockland is a prominent developer specializing in creating connected communities, with a market capitalization of approximately A$10.80 billion.
 The company generates revenue primarily through its Communities and Commercial Property segments, with figures amounting to A$1.77 billion and A$0.81 billion respectively.
 35.6%
Stockland, priced at A$4.53, trades below its estimated fair value of A$7.04, suggesting a significant undervaluation based on discounted cash flow analysis. Expected to outperform with a 22% annual earnings growth over the next three years—higher than the Australian market average of 13.7%. However, its profit margins have declined to 9.1% from last year's 31%, and dividends are poorly supported by cash flows, indicating potential financial stress despite forecasted revenue growth outpacing the market at 7% annually.

Stockland Insider Ups Holding By 32% During Year

Insiders were net buyers of 
 (
) stock during the past year. That is, insiders bought more stock than they sold.
While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.
The MD, CEO & Director Tarun Gupta made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for AU$868k worth of shares at a price of AU$4.21 each. That implies that an insider found the current price of AU$4.60 per share to be enticing. That means they have been optimistic about the company in the past, though they may have changed their mind. If someone buys shares at well below current prices, it's a good sign on balance, but keep in mind they may no longer see value. The good news for Stockland share holders is that an insider was buying at near the current price. The only individual insider to buy over the last year was Tarun Gupta.
You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!

I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. From our data, it seems that Stockland insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about AU$13m. We do generally prefer see higher levels of insider ownership.
The fact that there have been no Stockland insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening. Insiders own shares in Stockland and we see no evidence to suggest they are worried about the future. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Case in point: We've spotted

Do Its Financials Have Any Role To Play In Driving Stockland's (ASX:SGP) Stock Up Recently?

Stockland's (ASX:SGP) stock is up by a considerable 10.0% over the past month. Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely to see if they had a hand to play in the recent price move. Specifically, we decided to study 
 ROE in this article.
Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Stockland is:
4.3% = AU$438m ÷ AU$10b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).
The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every A$1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn A$0.04 in profit.
So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or "retains" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.
At first glance, Stockland's ROE doesn't look very promising. We then compared the company's ROE to the broader industry and were disappointed to see that the ROE is lower than the industry average of 6.7%. However, the moderate 16% net income growth seen by Stockland over the past five years is definitely a positive. So, there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.
Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Stockland's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 12% in the same period, which is great to see.
Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is SGP worth today? The 
 helps visualize whether SGP is currently mispriced by the market.
Stockland has a high three-year median payout ratio of 72%. This means that it has only 28% of its income left to reinvest into its business. However, it's not unusual to see a REIT with such a high payout ratio mainly due to statutory requirements. Despite this, the company's earnings grew moderately as we saw above.
Besides, Stockland has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 78% of its profits over the next three years. However, Stockland's ROE is predicted to rise to 7.7% despite there being no anticipated change in its payout ratio.
In total, it does look like Stockland has some positive aspects to its business. Namely, its high earnings growth. We do however feel that the earnings growth number could have been even higher, had the company been reinvesting more of its earnings and paid out less dividends. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates. To know more about the company's future earnings growth forecasts take a look at this

Declining Stock and Decent Financials: Is The Market Wrong About Stockland (ASX:SGP)?

Stockland (ASX:SGP) has had a rough week with its share price down 2.8%. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financials over the long term, which in this case look pretty respectable. In this article, we decided to focus on 
 ROE.
Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Stockland is:
2.4% = AU$241m ÷ AU$10b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).
The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each A$1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made A$0.02 in profit.
We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or "retains" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
As you can see, Stockland's ROE looks pretty weak. Even compared to the average industry ROE of 5.4%, the company's ROE is quite dismal. Although, we can see that Stockland saw a modest net income growth of 15% over the past five years. We reckon that there could be other factors at play here. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.
We then performed a comparison between Stockland's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 14% in the same 5-year period.
Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is SGP worth today? The 
 helps visualize whether SGP is currently mispriced by the market.
Stockland seems to be paying out most of its income as dividends judging by its three-year median payout ratio of 74%, meaning the company retains only 26% of its income. However, this is typical for REITs as they are often required by law to distribute most of their earnings. In spite of this, the company was able to grow its earnings by a fair bit, as we saw above.
Additionally, Stockland has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 75%. Regardless, the future ROE for Stockland is predicted to rise to 8.4% despite there being not much change expected in its payout ratio.
On the whole, we do feel that Stockland has some positive attributes. While no doubt its earnings growth is pretty substantial, we do feel that the reinvestment rate is pretty low, meaning, the earnings growth number could have been significantly higher had the company been retaining more of its profits. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.
