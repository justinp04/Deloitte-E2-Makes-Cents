Avoid TPG Telecom On The ASX And Explore One Better Dividend Stock Option

The appeal of dividend stocks in the Australian market is undeniable, especially for those looking to generate income. However, caution is advised as some companies exhibit warning signs that could affect their ability to sustain dividends. For instance, firms like TPG Telecom with high payout ratios may struggle to maintain their dividend payments, posing risks for long-term investors.
Let's take a closer look at one of our picks from the screened companies and one you may wish to avoid.
 ★★★★☆☆
 Ricegrowers Limited is a global rice food company with operations spanning Australia, New Zealand, the Pacific Islands, the Middle East, and the United States, boasting a market capitalization of A$508.42 million.
 Ricegrowers' revenue is generated through several segments, with Riviana contributing A$222.01 million, Cop Rice A$252.75 million, Rice Food A$121.03 million, Rice Pool A$498.11 million, and International Rice A$894.03 million.
 7.0%
Ricegrowers Limited (SunRice Group), with a dividend yield of 6.98%, stands out in the Australian market, particularly when compared to companies with unsustainable high payout ratios. Despite its relatively short history of dividend payments and some volatility, Ricegrowers maintains a healthy coverage with a cash payout ratio at 44% and an earnings payout ratio at 56.4%. The company's recent financial performance shows robust growth, reporting A$1.87 billion in sales and A$63.14 million in net income for FY2024, marking significant improvements from the previous year. Additionally, management's focus on strategic acquisitions indicates a proactive approach to sustaining and potentially enhancing shareholder value through careful expansion.
 ★☆☆☆☆☆
 TPG Telecom Limited, an Australian telecommunications provider, offers services to consumer, business, enterprise, government and wholesale customers with a market capitalization of A$8.50 billion.
 TPG Telecom's revenue is derived from two main segments: Consumer at A$4.53 billion and Enterprise, Government, and Wholesale at A$1.12 billion.
 3.9%
TPG Telecom, despite a dividend yield of 3.93%, falls short for dividend investors due to its unsustainable payout ratio of 681.9%. The dividends are poorly covered by both earnings and cash flows, signaling potential risk in maintaining future payments. Recent M&A rumors suggest strategic shifts but do not alleviate the fundamental issues with its high payout commitment and low profit margins (0.9%), making it less appealing compared to more stable dividend options in the market.

TPG Telecom (ASX:TPG) Has Announced A Dividend Of A$0.09

 (
) investors are due to receive a payment of A$0.09 per share on 11th of October. Including this payment, the dividend yield on the stock will be 3.2%, which is a modest boost for shareholders' returns.
The dividend yield is a little bit low, but sustainability of the payments is also an important part of evaluating an income stock. At the time of the last dividend payment, TPG Telecom was paying out a very large proportion of what it was earning and 128% of cash flows. This is certainly a risk factor, as reduced cash flows could force the company to pay a lower dividend.
Over the next year, EPS is forecast to fall by 28.6%. If the dividend continues along the path it has been on recently, the payout ratio in 12 months could be 119%, which is definitely a bit high to be sustainable going forward.
The company has maintained a consistent dividend for a few years now, but we would like to see a longer track record before relying on it. The annual payment during the last 2 years was A$0.075 in 2021, and the most recent fiscal year payment was A$0.18. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 55% per annum over that time. We're not overly excited about the relatively short history of dividend payments, however the dividend is growing at a nice rate and we might take a closer look.
Some investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. However, initial appearances might be deceiving. Over the past three years, it looks as though TPG Telecom's EPS has declined at around 18% a year. Such rapid declines definitely have the potential to constrain dividend payments if the trend continues into the future.
Overall, we don't think this company makes a great dividend stock, even though the dividend wasn't cut this year. The track record isn't great, and the payments are a bit high to be considered sustainable. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.
It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 
 that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Is TPG Telecom not quite the opportunity you were looking for? Why not check out our

Is TPG Telecom Limited's (ASX:TPG) Recent Stock Performance Influenced By Its Fundamentals In Any Way?

TPG Telecom (ASX:TPG) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 13% over the last three months. We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to 
 ROE today.
ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for TPG Telecom is:
3.3% = AU$394m ÷ AU$12b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).
The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each A$1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made A$0.03 in profit.
Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or "retains" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.
It is hard to argue that TPG Telecom's ROE is much good in and of itself. Even compared to the average industry ROE of 6.4%, the company's ROE is quite dismal. In spite of this, TPG Telecom was able to grow its net income considerably, at a rate of 40% in the last five years. We believe that there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.
As a next step, we compared TPG Telecom's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 40% in the same period.
Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to 
, relative to its industry.
TPG Telecom has a significant three-year median payout ratio of 85%, meaning the company only retains 15% of its income. This implies that the company has been able to achieve high earnings growth despite returning most of its profits to shareholders.
Additionally, TPG Telecom has paid dividends over a period of three years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 120% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected increase in the payout ratio explains the expected decline in the company's ROE to 2.6%, over the same period.
On the whole, we do feel that TPG Telecom has some positive attributes. That is, quite an impressive growth in earnings. However, the low profit retention means that the company's earnings growth could have been higher, had it been reinvesting a higher portion of its profits. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

TPG Telecom Limited (ASX:TPG) Shares Could Be 32% Above Their Intrinsic Value Estimate

How far off is TPG Telecom Limited (
) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.
Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the 
.
As TPG Telecom operates in the telecom sector, we need to calculate the intrinsic value slightly differently. In this approach dividends per share (DPS) are used, as free cash flow is difficult to estimate and often not reported by analysts. Unless a company pays out the majority of its FCF as a dividend, this method will typically underestimate the value of the stock. The 'Gordon Growth Model' is used, which simply assumes that dividend payments will continue to increase at a sustainable growth rate forever. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a company's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In this case we used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%). The expected dividend per share is then discounted to today's value at a cost of equity of 5.8%. Relative to the current share price of AU$4.5, the company appears reasonably expensive at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.
Value Per Share = Expected Dividend Per Share / (Discount Rate - Perpetual Growth Rate)
= AU$0.2 / (5.8% – 2.2%)
= AU$3.4
Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at TPG Telecom as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 5.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a premium to intrinsic value? For TPG Telecom, there are three fundamental items you should consider:
