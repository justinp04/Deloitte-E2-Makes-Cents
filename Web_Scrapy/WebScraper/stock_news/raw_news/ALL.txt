At AU$44.65, Is It Time To Put Aristocrat Leisure Limited (ASX:ALL) On Your Watch List?

Aristocrat Leisure Limited (
) saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the ASX. The company's trading levels have approached the yearly peak, following the recent bounce in the share price. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Aristocrat Leisure’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.
According to our valuation model, Aristocrat Leisure seems to be fairly priced at around 16% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Aristocrat Leisure today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is A$53.37, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. In addition to this, Aristocrat Leisure has a low beta, which suggests its share price is less volatile than the wider market.
Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of Aristocrat Leisure, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting earnings growth of 7.6%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term.
 ALL’s future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?
 If you’ve been keeping tabs on ALL, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

Investing in Aristocrat Leisure (ASX:ALL) five years ago would have delivered you a 82% gain

Generally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. To wit, the Aristocrat Leisure share price has climbed 71% in five years, easily topping the market return of 23% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 27% in the last year , including dividends .
With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.
There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).
Over half a decade, Aristocrat Leisure managed to grow its earnings per share at 22% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 11% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.
The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).
It's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. This 
 interactive report on Aristocrat Leisure's 
 is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.
It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Aristocrat Leisure the TSR over the last 5 years was 82%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the 
 shareholder return.
We're pleased to report that Aristocrat Leisure shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 27% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 13%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. If you want to research this stock further, the data on insider buying is an obvious place to start. You can

We continue to see strong growth across our business lines, as three of our four segments, including iLottery, Games, and Sports, all demonstrated strong double-digit growth in 2023.
We are focused on achieving sustainable growth and remain encouraged by the interest and pipeline in the U.S. market for our iGaming offering. As we look ahead, we will maintain our focus on investing in the execution of our recently announced partnerships and product enhancements. These efforts will further strengthen our capabilities and position us to capitalize on the meaningful growth opportunities across our business as the market continues to evolve.”

______________________________
On May 15, 2023, the Company entered into a definitive Business Combination Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Aristocrat Leisure Limited (ASX:ALL) (“Aristocrat”) and Anaxi Investments Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company and wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Aristocrat (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which the Company is to be acquired by Aristocrat for $29.50 per share in an all-cash transaction. Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company agreed to transfer its statutory seat, registered office and seat of central administration (siège de l'administration centrale) from the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg to the Cayman Islands by way of continuation (the “Continuation”) and as promptly practical, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, which will be the surviving company and become a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Aristocrat (the “Merger”). On July 18, 2023, NeoGames’ shareholders approved the Agreement and the Continuation, which will become effective subject to certain regulatory approvals. A second NeoGames shareholder vote to approve the Merger will take place immediately following the effectiveness of the Continuation during the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. NeoGames’ shareholders representing approximately 61% of the Company’s outstanding shares have executed a support agreement with Aristocrat, pursuant to which they have also irrevocably agreed to vote in favor of the Merger. Completion of the transaction is contingent upon customary closing conditions, including the receipt of all required gaming and antitrust approvals. We continue to receive regulatory approvals as we work closely with Aristocrat towards finalizing the deal. We currently remain on track and expect to receive all regulatory approvals before the end of April 2024.

We caution you therefore against relying on these forward-looking statements, and we qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. These statements reflect management’s current expectations regarding future events and operating performance and speak only as of the date of this press release. You should not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.

Except as required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, after the date on which the statements are made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
This press release may include E(L)BIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, NPI and NPI Revenues Interest, adjusted net income (loss), Adjusted EPS and revenues growth measured in constant currency which are financial measures not presented in accordance with IFRS. We use these financial measures to supplement our results presented in accordance with IFRS. We include these non-IFRS financial measures because they are used by our management to evaluate our operating performance and trends and to make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital and new investments. The Company presents revenues growth measured in constant currency since we use constant currency information to provide a framework in assessing how our business and geographic segments performed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and believe this information is useful to investors to facilitate comparisons and better identify trends in our business.
 adjusted net income (loss), Adjusted EPS and revenues growth measured in constant currency. We define “E(L)BIT” as net income (loss), plus income taxes, and interest and finance-related expenses. We define “EBITDA” as E(L)BIT, plus depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, plus share-based compensation, prospective business combination and business combination related expenses and the Company’s share in NPI depreciation and amortization. We define adjusted net income (loss) as net loss adjusted by adding amortization attributable to intangible assets acquired in business combination, net of tax. We define adjusted EPS as adjusted net income (loss) divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding. We define revenues growth measured in constant currency as revenue adjusted by using the average foreign exchange rates for fiscal year 2023, as reported by third parties, when converting revenues recorded in foreign currencies to US dollar. We believe E(L)BIT, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss) and revenues growth measured in constant currency are useful in evaluating our operating performance, as they are regularly used by security analysts, institutional investors and others in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss) and revenues growth measured in constant currency are not intended to be a substitute for any IFRS financial measure and, as calculated, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of performance of other companies in other industries or within the same industry.
Refers to NeoPollard Interactive LLC that represents the Company’s 50/50 joint venture with Pollard Banknote Limited (“Pollard”). The joint venture was formed for the purpose of identifying, pursuing, winning and executing iLottery contracts in the North American lottery market. NPI is managed by an executive board of four members, consisting of two members appointed by NeoGames and two members appointed by Pollard. NPI has its own general manager and dedicated workforce and operates as a separate entity. However, it relies on NeoGames and Pollard for certain services, such as technology development, business operations and support services from NeoGames and corporate services, including legal, banking and certain human resources services, from Pollard.
 NPI Revenues is not recorded as revenues in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss, but rather is reflected in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with the equity method, as we share 50% of the profit of NPI subject to certain adjustments.

Aristocrat Will Consider Sale, Spinoff of Game Developers in Strategic Review

Australia-based slots and digital gaming company Aristocrat Leisure will consider a sale or a spinoff of two game developers that no longer fit in as well in its portfolio.
================================================================================

Is Aristocrat Leisure Limited (ASX:ALL) Trading At A 35% Discount?

Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Aristocrat Leisure Limited (
) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.
We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the 
.
We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:
 = AU$14b
After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.4%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$2.7b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.4%– 2.2%) = AU$52b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$52b÷ ( 1 + 7.4%)
= AU$25b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is AU$40b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of AU$40.3, the company appears quite undervalued at a 35% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.
Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Aristocrat Leisure as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.143. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Aristocrat Leisure, there are three further items you should further examine:

Aristocrat Leisure (ASX:ALL) Has Announced That It Will Be Increasing Its Dividend To A$0.36

 (
) dividend will be increasing from last year's payment of the same period to A$0.36 on 2nd of July. Based on this payment, the dividend yield for the company will be 1.5%, which is fairly typical for the industry.
We like a dividend to be consistent over the long term, so checking whether it is sustainable is important. Before making this announcement, Aristocrat Leisure was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.
Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 21.3%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 27% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.
The company has a long dividend track record, but it doesn't look great with cuts in the past. Since 2014, the dividend has gone from A$0.09 total annually to A$0.72. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 23% a year over that time. Despite the rapid growth in the dividend over the past number of years, we have seen the payments go down the past as well, so that makes us cautious.
Given that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. It's encouraging to see that Aristocrat Leisure has been growing its earnings per share at 19% a year over the past five years. Growth in EPS bodes well for the dividend, as does the low payout ratio that the company is currently reporting.
Overall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Aristocrat Leisure is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.
Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. Earnings growth generally bodes well for the future value of company dividend payments. See if the 13 Aristocrat Leisure analysts we track are forecasting continued growth with our

Aristocrat Leisure Ltd (
) recently announced a 
 of $0.36 per share, payable on 2024-07-02, with the ex-dividend date set for 2024-05-23. As investors look forward to this upcoming payment, the spotlight also shines on the company's dividend history, yield, and growth rates. Using the data from GuruFocus, let's delve into Aristocrat Leisure Ltd's dividend performance and assess its sustainability.
Aristocrat Leisure is an electronic gaming machine manufacturer that sells machines to pubs, clubs, and casinos. The firm is licensed in all Australian states and territories, North American jurisdictions, and essentially every major country. Aristocrat is one of the top three largest players in the space along with International Game Technology and Light & Wonder. Through acquisitions of Plarium and more recently Big Fish, Aristocrat now derives a significant proportion of earnings from the faster growing mobile gaming business.
Aristocrat Leisure Ltd has maintained a consistent 
 record since 2010, with dividends currently distributed on a bi-annual basis. Below is a chart showing annual 
 for tracking historical trends.
As of today, Aristocrat Leisure Ltd currently has a 12-month 
 of 1.37% and a 12-month 
 of 1.53%. This suggests an expectation of increased dividend payments over the next 12 months. Over the past three years, Aristocrat Leisure Ltd's annual 
 was 18.20%, which decreased to 5.00% per year over a five-year horizon, and an impressive 16.80% over the past decade.
To assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The 
 provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. As of 2024-03-31, Aristocrat Leisure Ltd's dividend payout ratio is 0.28, suggesting good retention of earnings for growth and stability. Additionally, Aristocrat Leisure Ltd's 
 of 9 out of 10 as of 2024-03-31, combined with consistent net profit in 9 out of the past 10 years, underscores strong profitability prospects.
Aristocrat Leisure Ltd's 
 of 9 out of 10 suggests a promising growth trajectory. The company's robust 
 and a 3-year revenue growth rate of approximately 14.00% per year, along with a 3-year EPS growth rate of approximately 39.50% per year, and a 5-year EBITDA growth rate of 12.00%, all point to a strong revenue and earnings model that supports sustainable dividend payments.
The analysis of Aristocrat Leisure Ltd's dividend payments, growth rates, payout ratio, and profitability suggests a positive outlook for current and prospective investors.

Here's Why We Think Aristocrat Leisure (ASX:ALL) Might Deserve Your Attention Today

The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.
In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like 
 (
), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Aristocrat Leisure with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.
The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. To the delight of shareholders, Aristocrat Leisure has achieved impressive annual EPS growth of 54%, compound, over the last three years. While that sort of growth rate isn't sustainable for long, it certainly catches the eye of prospective investors.
One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. The good news is that Aristocrat Leisure is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 2.2 percentage points to 28%, over the last year. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.

Insider interest in a company always sparks a bit of intrigue and many investors are on the lookout for companies where insiders are putting their money where their mouth is. Because often, the purchase of stock is a sign that the buyer views it as undervalued. However, insiders are sometimes wrong, and we don't know the exact thinking behind their acquisitions.
Not only did Aristocrat Leisure insiders refrain from selling stock during the year, but they also spent AU$212k buying it. That's nice to see, because it suggests insiders are optimistic. It is also worth noting that it was Non-Executive Director Bill Lance who made the biggest single purchase, worth AU$153k, paying AU$41.89 per share.
The good news, alongside the insider buying, for Aristocrat Leisure bulls is that insiders (collectively) have a meaningful investment in the stock. As a matter of fact, their holding is valued at AU$44m. That shows significant buy-in, and may indicate conviction in the business strategy. Even though that's only about 0.2% of the company, it's enough money to indicate alignment between the leaders of the business and ordinary shareholders.
Aristocrat Leisure's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. What's more, insiders own a significant stake in the company and have been buying more shares. This quick rundown suggests that the business may be of good quality, and also at an inflection point, so maybe Aristocrat Leisure deserves timely attention. Of course, just because Aristocrat Leisure is growing does not mean it is undervalued. If you're wondering about the valuation, check out

There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. So if you like the sound of Aristocrat Leisure, you'll probably love this

Shareholders Are Optimistic That Aristocrat Leisure (ASX:ALL) Will Multiply In Value

What trends should we look for it we want to identify stocks that can multiply in value over the long term? Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing 
 on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding 
 of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So, when we ran our eye over 
 (
) trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.
Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Aristocrat Leisure is:
0.20 = AU$1.8b ÷ (AU$10b - AU$1.3b) 
.
Therefore, 
 That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 8.2% earned by companies in a similar industry.
Above you can see how the current ROCE for Aristocrat Leisure compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our 
.
In terms of Aristocrat Leisure's history of ROCE, it's quite impressive. The company has consistently earned 20% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 80% in that time. Now considering ROCE is an attractive 20%, this combination is actually pretty appealing because it means the business can consistently put money to work and generate these high returns. If Aristocrat Leisure can keep this up, we'd be very optimistic about its future.
In summary, we're delighted to see that Aristocrat Leisure has been compounding returns by reinvesting at consistently high rates of return, as these are common traits of a multi-bagger. Therefore it's no surprise that shareholders have earned a respectable 63% return if they held over the last five years. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.
While Aristocrat Leisure looks impressive, no company is worth an infinite price. The 
 helps visualize whether it is currently trading for a fair price.
High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our

Institutions own 41% of Aristocrat Leisure Limited (ASX:ALL) shares but retail investors control 48% of the company

To get a sense of who is truly in control of Aristocrat Leisure Limited (
), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are retail investors with 48% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
Institutions, on the other hand, account for 41% of the company's stockholders. Generally speaking, as a company grows, institutions will increase their ownership. Conversely, insiders often decrease their ownership over time.
Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Aristocrat Leisure.
Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.
Aristocrat Leisure already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Aristocrat Leisure's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.
Aristocrat Leisure is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is BlackRock, Inc. with 7.3% of shares outstanding. The second and third largest shareholders are Australian Super Pty Ltd and State Street Global Advisors, Inc., with an equal amount of shares to their name at 6.4%.
A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.
While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.
Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Aristocrat Leisure Limited in their own names. We do note, however, it is possible insiders have an indirect interest through a private company or other corporate structure. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own AU$48m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to 
The general public-- including retail investors -- own 48% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.
We can see that Private Companies own 12%, of the shares on issue. Private companies may be related parties. Sometimes insiders have an interest in a public company through a holding in a private company, rather than in their own capacity as an individual. While it's hard to draw any broad stroke conclusions, it is worth noting as an area for further research.
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

Is Aristocrat Leisure Limited's (ASX:ALL) Stock's Recent Performance Being Led By Its Attractive Financial Prospects?

Aristocrat Leisure's (ASX:ALL) stock is up by a considerable 34% over the past three months. Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study 
 ROE in this article.
ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.
The 
 is:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Aristocrat Leisure is:
23% = AU$1.5b ÷ AU$6.5b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).
The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each A$1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made A$0.23 in profit.
We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or "retains" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.
Firstly, we acknowledge that Aristocrat Leisure has a significantly high ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 10% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. This probably laid the groundwork for Aristocrat Leisure's moderate 8.3% net income growth seen over the past five years.
We then performed a comparison between Aristocrat Leisure's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 7.4% in the same 5-year period.
Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is ALL worth today? The 
 helps visualize whether ALL is currently mispriced by the market.
Aristocrat Leisure has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 34% (or a retention ratio of 66%) and a respectable amount of growth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making efficient use of its profits.
Besides, Aristocrat Leisure has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 47% over the next three years. Regardless, the ROE is not expected to change much for the company despite the higher expected payout ratio.
In total, we are pretty happy with Aristocrat Leisure's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

Should You Think About Buying Aristocrat Leisure Limited (ASX:ALL) Now?

Aristocrat Leisure Limited (
) led the ASX gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. The company's trading levels have reached its high for the past year, following the recent bounce in the share price. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at Aristocrat Leisure’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.
The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It’s trading around 8.3% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Aristocrat Leisure today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth A$58.83, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. What's more, Aristocrat Leisure’s share price may be more stable over time (relative to the market), as indicated by its low beta.
Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 12% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for Aristocrat Leisure. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.

At AU$44.65, Is It Time To Put Aristocrat Leisure Limited (ASX:ALL) On Your Watch List?

Aristocrat Leisure Limited (
) saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the ASX. The company's trading levels have approached the yearly peak, following the recent bounce in the share price. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Aristocrat Leisure’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.
According to our valuation model, Aristocrat Leisure seems to be fairly priced at around 16% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Aristocrat Leisure today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is A$53.37, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. In addition to this, Aristocrat Leisure has a low beta, which suggests its share price is less volatile than the wider market.
Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of Aristocrat Leisure, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting earnings growth of 7.6%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term.
 ALL’s future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?
 If you’ve been keeping tabs on ALL, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

Investing in Aristocrat Leisure (ASX:ALL) five years ago would have delivered you a 82% gain

Generally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. To wit, the Aristocrat Leisure share price has climbed 71% in five years, easily topping the market return of 23% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 27% in the last year , including dividends .
With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.
There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).
Over half a decade, Aristocrat Leisure managed to grow its earnings per share at 22% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 11% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.
The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).
It's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. This 
 interactive report on Aristocrat Leisure's 
 is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.
It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Aristocrat Leisure the TSR over the last 5 years was 82%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the 
 shareholder return.
We're pleased to report that Aristocrat Leisure shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 27% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 13%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. If you want to research this stock further, the data on insider buying is an obvious place to start. You can 
Aristocrat Leisure is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this

Moti Malul, Chief Executive Officer of NeoGames, said: “We are very pleased with the progress we made during the fourth quarter and during the entire year of 2023, progressing our strategic goals and working to complete our merger with Aristocrat Leisure, which we announced last May. We continue to see strong growth across our business lines, as three of our four segments, including iLottery, Games, and Sports, all demonstrated strong double-digit growth in 2023.
We are focused on achieving sustainable growth and remain encouraged by the interest and pipeline in the U.S. market for our iGaming offering.

These efforts will further strengthen our capabilities and position us to capitalize on the meaningful growth opportunities across our business as the market continues to evolve.”

______________________________
On May 15, 2023, the Company entered into a definitive Business Combination Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Aristocrat Leisure Limited (ASX:ALL) (“Aristocrat”) and Anaxi Investments Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company and wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Aristocrat (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which the Company is to be acquired by Aristocrat for $29.50 per share in an all-cash transaction. Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company agreed to transfer its statutory seat, registered office and seat of central administration (siège de l'administration centrale) from the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg to the Cayman Islands by way of continuation (the “Continuation”) and as promptly practical, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, which will be the surviving company and become a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Aristocrat (the “Merger”). On July 18, 2023, NeoGames’ shareholders approved the Agreement and the Continuation, which will become effective subject to certain regulatory approvals. A second NeoGames shareholder vote to approve the Merger will take place immediately following the effectiveness of the Continuation during the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. NeoGames’ shareholders representing approximately 61% of the Company’s outstanding shares have executed a support agreement with Aristocrat, pursuant to which they have also irrevocably agreed to vote in favor of the Merger. Completion of the transaction is contingent upon customary closing conditions, including the receipt of all required gaming and antitrust approvals. We continue to receive regulatory approvals as we work closely with Aristocrat towards finalizing the deal. We currently remain on track and expect to receive all regulatory approvals before the end of April 2024. We continue to plan to work closely with those remaining regulatory authorities and expect a closing date in May 2024 is possible. Please refer to the Company’s Current Report on Form 6-K filed on June 21, 2023 for further detail.
In light of the expected sale of the Company to Aristocrat, NeoGames will not be hosting a conference call, or providing quantitative financial guidance in conjunction with its fourth quarter and year-end 2023 earnings release.

We have a concentrated customer base, and our failure to retain our existing contracts with our customers could have a significant adverse effect on our business; our inability to successfully integrate Aspire, or complete or integrate other future acquisitions, could limit our future growth or otherwise be disruptive to our ongoing business; a reduction in discretionary consumer spending could have an adverse impact on our business; the growth of our business largely depends on our continued ability to procure new contracts; we incur significant costs related to the procurement of new contracts, which we may be unable to recover in a timely manner, or at all; intense competition exists in the iLottery industry, and we expect competition to continue to intensify; our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions; in addition to competition with other iLottery providers, we and our customers also compete with providers of other online offerings; the gaming and lottery industries are heavily regulated, and changes to the regulatory framework in the jurisdictions in which we operate could harm our existing operations; while we have not experienced a material impact to date, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including variants, and similar health epidemics and contagious disease outbreaks could significantly disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition; and other risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on April 28, 2023, and other documents filed with or furnished to the SEC. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. We caution you therefore against relying on these forward-looking statements, and we qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.

Except as required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, after the date on which the statements are made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
This press release may include E(L)BIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, NPI and NPI Revenues Interest, adjusted net income (loss), Adjusted EPS and revenues growth measured in constant currency which are financial measures not presented in accordance with IFRS. We use these financial measures to supplement our results presented in accordance with IFRS. We include these non-IFRS financial measures because they are used by our management to evaluate our operating performance and trends and to make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital and new investments. The Company presents revenues growth measured in constant currency since we use constant currency information to provide a framework in assessing how our business and geographic segments performed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and believe this information is useful to investors to facilitate comparisons and better identify trends in our business.
 adjusted net income (loss), Adjusted EPS and revenues growth measured in constant currency. We define “E(L)BIT” as net income (loss), plus income taxes, and interest and finance-related expenses. We define “EBITDA” as E(L)BIT, plus depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, plus share-based compensation, prospective business combination and business combination related expenses and the Company’s share in NPI depreciation and amortization. We define adjusted net income (loss) as net loss adjusted by adding amortization attributable to intangible assets acquired in business combination, net of tax. We define adjusted EPS as adjusted net income (loss) divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding. We define revenues growth measured in constant currency as revenue adjusted by using the average foreign exchange rates for fiscal year 2023, as reported by third parties, when converting revenues recorded in foreign currencies to US dollar. We believe E(L)BIT, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss) and revenues growth measured in constant currency are useful in evaluating our operating performance, as they are regularly used by security analysts, institutional investors and others in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss) and revenues growth measured in constant currency are not intended to be a substitute for any IFRS financial measure and, as calculated, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of performance of other companies in other industries or within the same industry.
Refers to NeoPollard Interactive LLC that represents the Company’s 50/50 joint venture with Pollard Banknote Limited (“Pollard”). The joint venture was formed for the purpose of identifying, pursuing, winning and executing iLottery contracts in the North American lottery market. NPI is managed by an executive board of four members, consisting of two members appointed by NeoGames and two members appointed by Pollard. NPI has its own general manager and dedicated workforce and operates as a separate entity. However, it relies on NeoGames and Pollard for certain services, such as technology development, business operations and support services from NeoGames and corporate services, including legal, banking and certain human resources services, from Pollard.
 NPI Revenues is not recorded as revenues in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss, but rather is reflected in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with the equity method, as we share 50% of the profit of NPI subject to certain adjustments.

Is Aristocrat Leisure Limited (ASX:ALL) Trading At A 35% Discount?

Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Aristocrat Leisure Limited (
) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.
We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the 
.
We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:
 = AU$14b
After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.4%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$2.7b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.4%– 2.2%) = AU$52b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$52b÷ ( 1 + 7.4%)
= AU$25b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is AU$40b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of AU$40.3, the company appears quite undervalued at a 35% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.
Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Aristocrat Leisure as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.143. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Aristocrat Leisure, there are three further items you should further examine:

Aristocrat Will Consider Sale, Spinoff of Game Developers in Strategic Review

Australia-based slots and digital gaming company Aristocrat Leisure will consider a sale or a spinoff of two game developers that no longer fit in as well in its portfolio.
================================================================================

Aristocrat Leisure (ASX:ALL) Has Announced That It Will Be Increasing Its Dividend To A$0.36

 (
) dividend will be increasing from last year's payment of the same period to A$0.36 on 2nd of July. Based on this payment, the dividend yield for the company will be 1.5%, which is fairly typical for the industry.
We like a dividend to be consistent over the long term, so checking whether it is sustainable is important. Before making this announcement, Aristocrat Leisure was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.
Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 21.3%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 27% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.
The company has a long dividend track record, but it doesn't look great with cuts in the past. Since 2014, the dividend has gone from A$0.09 total annually to A$0.72. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 23% a year over that time. Despite the rapid growth in the dividend over the past number of years, we have seen the payments go down the past as well, so that makes us cautious.
Given that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. It's encouraging to see that Aristocrat Leisure has been growing its earnings per share at 19% a year over the past five years. Growth in EPS bodes well for the dividend, as does the low payout ratio that the company is currently reporting.
Overall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Aristocrat Leisure is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.
Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. Earnings growth generally bodes well for the future value of company dividend payments. See if the 13 Aristocrat Leisure analysts we track are forecasting continued growth with our

Here's Why We Think Aristocrat Leisure (ASX:ALL) Might Deserve Your Attention Today

The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.
In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like 
 (
), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Aristocrat Leisure with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.
The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. To the delight of shareholders, Aristocrat Leisure has achieved impressive annual EPS growth of 54%, compound, over the last three years. While that sort of growth rate isn't sustainable for long, it certainly catches the eye of prospective investors.
One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. The good news is that Aristocrat Leisure is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 2.2 percentage points to 28%, over the last year. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.

Insider interest in a company always sparks a bit of intrigue and many investors are on the lookout for companies where insiders are putting their money where their mouth is. Because often, the purchase of stock is a sign that the buyer views it as undervalued. However, insiders are sometimes wrong, and we don't know the exact thinking behind their acquisitions.
Not only did Aristocrat Leisure insiders refrain from selling stock during the year, but they also spent AU$212k buying it. That's nice to see, because it suggests insiders are optimistic. It is also worth noting that it was Non-Executive Director Bill Lance who made the biggest single purchase, worth AU$153k, paying AU$41.89 per share.
The good news, alongside the insider buying, for Aristocrat Leisure bulls is that insiders (collectively) have a meaningful investment in the stock. As a matter of fact, their holding is valued at AU$44m. That shows significant buy-in, and may indicate conviction in the business strategy. Even though that's only about 0.2% of the company, it's enough money to indicate alignment between the leaders of the business and ordinary shareholders.
Aristocrat Leisure's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. What's more, insiders own a significant stake in the company and have been buying more shares. This quick rundown suggests that the business may be of good quality, and also at an inflection point, so maybe Aristocrat Leisure deserves timely attention. Of course, just because Aristocrat Leisure is growing does not mean it is undervalued. If you're wondering about the valuation, check out

There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. So if you like the sound of Aristocrat Leisure, you'll probably love this

Aristocrat Leisure Ltd's Dividend Analysis

Aristocrat Leisure Ltd (
) recently announced a 
 of $0.36 per share, payable on 2024-07-02, with the ex-dividend date set for 2024-05-23. As investors look forward to this upcoming payment, the spotlight also shines on the company's dividend history, yield, and growth rates. Using the data from GuruFocus, let's delve into Aristocrat Leisure Ltd's dividend performance and assess its sustainability.
Aristocrat Leisure is an electronic gaming machine manufacturer that sells machines to pubs, clubs, and casinos. The firm is licensed in all Australian states and territories, North American jurisdictions, and essentially every major country. Aristocrat is one of the top three largest players in the space along with International Game Technology and Light & Wonder. Through acquisitions of Plarium and more recently Big Fish, Aristocrat now derives a significant proportion of earnings from the faster growing mobile gaming business.
Aristocrat Leisure Ltd has maintained a consistent 
 record since 2010, with dividends currently distributed on a bi-annual basis. Below is a chart showing annual 
 for tracking historical trends.
As of today, Aristocrat Leisure Ltd currently has a 12-month 
 of 1.37% and a 12-month 
 of 1.53%. This suggests an expectation of increased dividend payments over the next 12 months. Over the past three years, Aristocrat Leisure Ltd's annual 
 was 18.20%, which decreased to 5.00% per year over a five-year horizon, and an impressive 16.80% over the past decade.
To assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The 
 provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. As of 2024-03-31, Aristocrat Leisure Ltd's dividend payout ratio is 0.28, suggesting good retention of earnings for growth and stability. Additionally, Aristocrat Leisure Ltd's 
 of 9 out of 10 as of 2024-03-31, combined with consistent net profit in 9 out of the past 10 years, underscores strong profitability prospects.
Aristocrat Leisure Ltd's 
 of 9 out of 10 suggests a promising growth trajectory. The company's robust 
 and a 3-year revenue growth rate of approximately 14.00% per year, along with a 3-year EPS growth rate of approximately 39.50% per year, and a 5-year EBITDA growth rate of 12.00%, all point to a strong revenue and earnings model that supports sustainable dividend payments.
The analysis of Aristocrat Leisure Ltd's dividend payments, growth rates, payout ratio, and profitability suggests a positive outlook for current and prospective investors. The company's ability to maintain a healthy payout ratio while fostering growth and profitability presents a compelling case for its dividends' sustainability. Investors looking for stable dividend income might find Aristocrat Leisure Ltd an attractive option. For further exploration, GuruFocus Premium users can utilize the

Institutions own 41% of Aristocrat Leisure Limited (ASX:ALL) shares but retail investors control 48% of the company

To get a sense of who is truly in control of Aristocrat Leisure Limited (
), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are retail investors with 48% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
Institutions, on the other hand, account for 41% of the company's stockholders. Generally speaking, as a company grows, institutions will increase their ownership. Conversely, insiders often decrease their ownership over time.
Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Aristocrat Leisure.
Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.
Aristocrat Leisure already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Aristocrat Leisure's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.
Aristocrat Leisure is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is BlackRock, Inc. with 7.3% of shares outstanding. The second and third largest shareholders are Australian Super Pty Ltd and State Street Global Advisors, Inc., with an equal amount of shares to their name at 6.4%.
A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.
While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.
Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Aristocrat Leisure Limited in their own names. We do note, however, it is possible insiders have an indirect interest through a private company or other corporate structure. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own AU$48m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to 
The general public-- including retail investors -- own 48% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.
We can see that Private Companies own 12%, of the shares on issue. Private companies may be related parties. Sometimes insiders have an interest in a public company through a holding in a private company, rather than in their own capacity as an individual. While it's hard to draw any broad stroke conclusions, it is worth noting as an area for further research.
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

Is Aristocrat Leisure Limited's (ASX:ALL) Stock's Recent Performance Being Led By Its Attractive Financial Prospects?

Aristocrat Leisure's (ASX:ALL) stock is up by a considerable 34% over the past three months. Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study 
 ROE in this article.
ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.
The 
 is:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Aristocrat Leisure is:
23% = AU$1.5b ÷ AU$6.5b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).
The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each A$1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made A$0.23 in profit.
We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or "retains" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.
Firstly, we acknowledge that Aristocrat Leisure has a significantly high ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 10% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. This probably laid the groundwork for Aristocrat Leisure's moderate 8.3% net income growth seen over the past five years.
We then performed a comparison between Aristocrat Leisure's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 7.4% in the same 5-year period.
Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is ALL worth today? The 
 helps visualize whether ALL is currently mispriced by the market.
Aristocrat Leisure has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 34% (or a retention ratio of 66%) and a respectable amount of growth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making efficient use of its profits.
Besides, Aristocrat Leisure has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 47% over the next three years. Regardless, the ROE is not expected to change much for the company despite the higher expected payout ratio.
In total, we are pretty happy with Aristocrat Leisure's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

Shareholders Are Optimistic That Aristocrat Leisure (ASX:ALL) Will Multiply In Value

What trends should we look for it we want to identify stocks that can multiply in value over the long term? Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing 
 on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding 
 of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So, when we ran our eye over 
 (
) trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.
Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Aristocrat Leisure is:
0.20 = AU$1.8b ÷ (AU$10b - AU$1.3b) 
.
Therefore, 
 That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 8.2% earned by companies in a similar industry.
Above you can see how the current ROCE for Aristocrat Leisure compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our 
.
In terms of Aristocrat Leisure's history of ROCE, it's quite impressive. The company has consistently earned 20% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 80% in that time. Now considering ROCE is an attractive 20%, this combination is actually pretty appealing because it means the business can consistently put money to work and generate these high returns. If Aristocrat Leisure can keep this up, we'd be very optimistic about its future.
In summary, we're delighted to see that Aristocrat Leisure has been compounding returns by reinvesting at consistently high rates of return, as these are common traits of a multi-bagger. Therefore it's no surprise that shareholders have earned a respectable 63% return if they held over the last five years. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.
While Aristocrat Leisure looks impressive, no company is worth an infinite price. The

Should You Think About Buying Aristocrat Leisure Limited (ASX:ALL) Now?

Aristocrat Leisure Limited (
) led the ASX gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. The company's trading levels have reached its high for the past year, following the recent bounce in the share price. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at Aristocrat Leisure’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.
The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It’s trading around 8.3% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Aristocrat Leisure today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth A$58.83, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. What's more, Aristocrat Leisure’s share price may be more stable over time (relative to the market), as indicated by its low beta.
Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 12% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for Aristocrat Leisure. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.
 It seems like the market has already priced in ALL’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?
 If you’ve been keeping tabs on ALL, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.
