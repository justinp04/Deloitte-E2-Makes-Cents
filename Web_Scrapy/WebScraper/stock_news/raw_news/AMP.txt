Investors in AMP (ASX:AMP) have unfortunately lost 55% over the last five years 2024-02-05T04:39:04.000Z

We think intelligent long term investing is the way to go. But along the way some stocks are going to perform badly. For example, after five long years the 
 (
) share price is a whole 60% lower. That is extremely sub-optimal, to say the least. And we doubt long term believers are the only worried holders, since the stock price has declined 29% over the last twelve months.
Now let's have a look at the company's fundamentals, and see if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.
AMP isn't currently profitable, so most analysts would look to revenue growth to get an idea of how fast the underlying business is growing. Shareholders of unprofitable companies usually expect strong revenue growth. As you can imagine, fast revenue growth, when maintained, often leads to fast profit growth.
In the last five years AMP saw its revenue shrink by 39% per year. That's definitely a weaker result than most pre-profit companies report. Arguably, the market has responded appropriately to this business performance by sending the share price down 10% (annualized) in the same time period. We don't generally like to own companies that lose money and don't grow revenues. You might be better off spending your money on a leisure activity. You'd want to research this company pretty thoroughly before buying, it looks a bit too risky for us.
The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).

It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for AMP the TSR over the last 5 years was -55%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!
AMP shareholders are down 25% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 6.4%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 9% per year over five years. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should "buy when there is blood on the streets", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand AMP better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered

AMP (ASX:AMP) Has Affirmed Its Dividend Of A$0.02 2024-02-16T21:30:30.000Z

 (
) has announced that it will pay a dividend of A$0.02 per share on the 4th of April. This payment means that the dividend yield will be 3.6%, which is around the industry average.
While the dividend yield is important for income investors, it is also important to consider any large share price moves, as this will generally outweigh any gains from distributions. Investors will be pleased to see that AMP's stock price has increased by 30% in the last 3 months, which is good for shareholders and can also explain a decrease in the dividend yield.
Solid dividend yields are great, but they only really help us if the payment is sustainable. Before this announcement, AMP was paying out 677% of what it was earning, and not generating any free cash flows either. This high of a dividend payment could start to put pressure on the balance sheet in the future.
Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise exponentially over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 35%, which would make us comfortable with the dividend's sustainability, despite the levels currently being elevated.
Although the company has a long dividend history, it has been cut at least once in the last 10 years. The dividend has gone from an annual total of A$0.25 in 2014 to the most recent total annual payment of A$0.04. The dividend has fallen 84% over that period. A company that decreases its dividend over time generally isn't what we are looking for.
With a relatively unstable dividend, and a poor history of shrinking dividends, it's even more important to see if EPS is growing. Over the past five years, it looks as though AMP's EPS has declined at around 6.4% a year. If earnings continue declining, the company may have to make the difficult choice of reducing the dividend or even stopping it completely - the opposite of dividend growth. Earnings are forecast to grow over the next 12 months and if that happens we could still be a little bit cautious until it becomes a pattern.
Overall, while some might be pleased that the dividend wasn't cut, we think this may help AMP make more consistent payments in the future. The company's earnings aren't high enough to be making such big distributions, and it isn't backed up by strong growth or consistency either. Overall, this doesn't get us very excited from an income standpoint.
Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. Just as an example, we've come across 
 you should be aware of, and 2 of them are significant. Is AMP not quite the opportunity you were looking for? Why not check out our

Hedge Funds Lose Favor in Australia’s $2.6 Trillion Pension Pot 2024-07-03T21:00:00.000Z

(Bloomberg) -- One of the world’s fastest growing pools of retirement capital is reducing its investments in hedge funds as regulatory scrutiny grows on fees and performance at Australian pension funds.
Most Read from Bloomberg
The average allocation to hedge funds was just 0.6% of growth investment options across Australia’s A$3.9 trillion ($2.6 trillion) pension pot in March, compared with 2.5% in mid 2020, according to the most recent data compiled by Chant West, a research firm. AMP Ltd.’s exposure has sunk to around half the prior year due to high fees, while Australian Retirement Trust, the nation’s second-biggest pension, says it doesn’t use them at all anymore.
“Hedge funds are expensive,” AMP’s head of portfolio management Stuart Eliot said in an interview in Sydney, adding that he prefers areas such as direct infrastructure, which he plans to increase.
Global investor appetite for almost every hedge fund strategy this year was down from 2023 after average management and performance fees hit the highest since 2015, a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. report found earlier this year. Meantime, popular and successful multi-strategy firms such as Millennium Management and Citadel aren’t readily accepting new money, while others require lockup periods too long for some pensions to stomach.
The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority runs an annual performance test for funds, designed to weed out under performing portfolios and clamp down on excessive fees.
That scrutiny is one reason Brighter Super doesn’t invest any of the A$32 billion it manages in hedge funds, said chief investment officer Mark Rider.
“Some of these hedge funds have promised a lot but haven’t delivered,” he said.
At Rest, an A$85 billion pension, a decision was made as far back as 2021 to reduce its hedge fund allocation to zero in part due to a lack of transparency around where the money is spent.
“In many ways the alignment of the owners to our members who care about sustainable development goals over the long term, just couldn’t come together in a way that enabled us to be confident in investing,” Rest Chief Investment Officer Andrew Lill said in an interview.
Other institutional investors are calling for a better deal. In May, a group led by the Teacher Retirement System of Texas published an open letter to the hedge fund industry, demanding changes to how the money managers get paid.
At the same time, there are parts of the world showing demand for hedge fund business is intact. Abu Dhabi officials are hoping to lure hedge fund managers to the city, offering perks to attract titans from New York, London, Hong Kong and Singapore. Neighboring Dubai is also drawing them in as funds look for new post-Brexit bases outside the City of London.
Risk, Reward Balance
Total assets in the hedge fund industry rose from around $2.9 trillion in 2015 to about $4.1 trillion by the end of 2023, according from Hedge Fund Research Inc. During the same period, global public pension fund allocation has remained around 8-9%.
Australia’s sovereign wealth fund still likes using hedge funds as they provide good returns for the level of risk taken, said Future Fund Chief Investment Officer Ben Samild. Its allocation ranges between 10-20% of his A$223 billion portfolio, he said.
“They’re a super useful addition to our portfolio and they’re super flexible, key to portfolio construction and producing the kind of returns of the kind of risks that we think is sensible,” he said in an interview.
Jun Bei Liu, who runs Tribeca Investment Partners’ Alpha Plus Fund, a long-short equity hedge fund, said she hasn’t seen a drop in business from Australian pension funds. At the same time, she’s witnessing increasing interest from clients in the Middle East.
“As a hedge fund manager, we live and die by our performance,” she said in an interview. So “if it doesn’t perform, I think it’s just not going to be sustainable.”
But for many, like Andrew Fisher at Australian Retirement Trust, there are better alternatives elsewhere.
“Private debt has, hands down, proven much more effective and it’s also much more scalable,” said Fisher, the firm’s head of investment strategy. Hedge funds “are quite expensive for the outcome they deliver and they just get challenging at scale,” he said.

Insignia Financial to Invest Billions in Global Private Credit 2024-07-05T05:59:33.000Z

(Bloomberg) -- Insignia Financial Ltd.’s pensions business is in the final stages of appointing external managers to deploy billions of dollars into global private credit markets.
Most Read from Bloomberg
The unit, which oversees about A$180 billion ($121 billion) of retirement savings across a range of funds, will lift its global private credit allocation to 3% to 5% of its portfolio in the next year, from its current allocation of close to zero. The fund is primarily looking for deals in the US and Europe, said MLC Asset Management Chief Investment Officer Dan Farmer, who manages the bulk of money in Insignia’s pensions business. MLC is part of the Insignia Financial Group.
Private credit has taken off in recent years, filling a gap as banks stepped back from some risky lending due to tightening regulations. Growth has been fueled by strong demand from investors such as endowments, insurers and pension funds, including Australia’s A$3.9 trillion pensions industry, which is increasingly looking overseas for investment opportunities.
“There’s been a lot of capital driving into that space,” Farmer said. “We see an opportunity, but we think we’ve got to be very selective and invest and choose our managers very, very carefully.” The fund has already had success in Australian private credit, where the allocation remains around 5% to 6%, he said.
Some of Australia’s largest pension funds, including A$285 billion Australian Retirement Trust and A$150 billion pension and wealth manager Colonial First State are among those making similar moves into private credit. Meanwhile, A$85 billion Rest is more cautious and is looking elsewhere for opportunities due to the large flows into the area.
Rival wealth and pension manager AMP Ltd. recently lifted its exposure to private credit, head of portfolio management Stuart Eliot said in an interview. It sits within AMP’s diversified credit portfolio which is around 6% to 7% of the overall portfolio.
“Around March or April we did our first international allocation and that was a blend of credit risk sharing and a more opportunistic strategy,” Eliot said.
Farmer said he was conscious of the competition.
“Yes, there’s capital flowing in, but there’s also been capital withdrawn,” Farmer said. “So that balance is not out of skew.”

AMP (ASX:AMP) shareholders have endured a 29% loss from investing in the stock five years ago 2024-07-14T22:35:22.000Z
