Investing in Axiom Properties (ASX:AXI) three years ago would have delivered you a 71% gain 2023-10-06T02:08:21.000Z

Investors are understandably disappointed when a stock they own declines in value. But it's hard to avoid some disappointing investments when the overall market is down. The 
 (
) is down 22% over three years, but the total shareholder return is 71% once you include the dividend. That's better than the market which returned 29% over the last three years.
With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.
While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).
Over the three years that the share price declined, Axiom Properties' earnings per share (EPS) dropped significantly, falling to a loss. Due to the loss, it's not easy to use EPS as a reliable guide to the business. But it's safe to say we'd generally expect the share price to be lower as a result!

Investors should note that there's a difference between Axiom Properties' total shareholder return (TSR) and its share price change, which we've covered above. The TSR attempts to capture the value of dividends (as if they were reinvested) as well as any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings offered to shareholders. Dividends have been really beneficial for Axiom Properties shareholders, and that cash payout contributed to why its TSR of 71%, over the last 3 years, is better than the share price return.
Axiom Properties shareholders are down 17% for the year, but the market itself is up 4.7%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 15% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

Bullish Axiom Properties Insiders Loaded Up On AU$2.08m Of Stock 2024-04-20T00:16:01.000Z

Over the last year, a good number of insiders have significantly increased their holdings in 
 (
). This is encouraging because it indicates that insiders are more optimistic about the company's prospects.
While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.
Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by insider Sean Baguley for AU$1.6m worth of shares, at about AU$0.04 per share. Although we like to see insider buying, we note that this large purchase was at significantly below the recent price of AU$0.046. While it does suggest insiders consider the stock undervalued at lower prices, this transaction doesn't tell us much about what they think of current prices.
Axiom Properties insiders may have bought shares in the last year, but they didn't sell any. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!

Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Insiders own 39% of Axiom Properties shares, worth about AU$7.7m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.
It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Axiom Properties shares in the last quarter. However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening. Insiders own shares in Axiom Properties and we see no evidence to suggest they are worried about the future. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Our analysis shows 
 (2 are potentially serious!) and we strongly recommend you look at these before investing.
