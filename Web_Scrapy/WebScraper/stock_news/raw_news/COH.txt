Deep Dive into Cochlear Ltd's Dividend Performance

Cochlear Ltd (
) recently announced a 
 of $0.57 per share, payable on 2023-10-26, with the ex-dividend date set for 2023-09-15. As investors look forward to this upcoming payment, the spotlight also shines on the company's dividend history, yield, and growth rates. Using the data from GuruFocus, let's deep dive into Cochlear Ltd's dividend performance and assess its sustainability.
Cochlear Ltd is the leading cochlear implant device manufacturer with around 60% global market share. Developed markets contribute 80% of group revenue where cochlear implants are the standard of care for children with severe to profound hearing loss. The company also actively targets the growing cohort of seniors in developed markets. Tender-oriented emerging markets contribute the remaining 20% of group revenue. Main products include cochlear implants, bone-anchored hearing aids, and associated sound processors. In fiscal 2020, 49% of revenue came from the Americas, 35% from Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, and 16% from the Asia-Pacific segment.
Cochlear Ltd has maintained a consistent 
 record since 2010. Dividends are currently distributed on a bi-annually basis. Below is a chart showing annual 
 for tracking historical trends.
As of today, Cochlear Ltd currently has a 12-month 
 of 1.15% and a 12-month 
 of 1.28%. This suggests an expectation of increased dividend payments over the next 12 months.
Over the past three years, Cochlear Ltd's annual 
 was 19.70%. Extended to a five-year horizon, this rate decreased to -0.80% per year. And over the past decade, Cochlear Ltd's annual dividends per share growth rate stands at -0.50%.
Based on Cochlear Ltd's dividend yield and five-year growth rate, the 
 of Cochlear Ltd stock as of today is approximately 1.10%.
To assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The 
 provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-06-30, Cochlear Ltd's dividend payout ratio is 0.65.
Cochlear Ltd's 
, offers an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers. GuruFocus ranks Cochlear Ltd's profitability 8 out of 10 as of 2023-06-30, suggesting good profitability prospects. The company has reported net profit in 9 years out of past 10 years.
To ensure the sustainability of dividends, a company must have robust growth metrics. Cochlear Ltd's 
 of 8 out of 10 suggests that the company's growth trajectory is good relative to its competitors.
Revenue is the lifeblood of any company, and Cochlear Ltd's 
, combined with the 
, indicates a strong revenue model. Cochlear Ltd's revenue has increased by approximately 9.90% per year on average, a rate that outperforms approximately 58.08% of global competitors.
Given Cochlear Ltd's consistent dividend payments, respectable growth rate, reasonable payout ratio, and strong profitability, the company appears to have a sustainable dividend policy. However, investors should continue to monitor these metrics and the company's overall performance to ensure the sustainability of future dividends.

Cochlear™ Osia® System becomes industry's first active bone conduction system to enable MRI at 3 Tesla

, 
 /PRNewswire/ -- Cochlear Limited (ASX: COH), the global leader in implantable hearing solutions, introduces its next generation 
 with the ability to have an MRI at 3.0 T, designed to improve hearing outcomes for people with conductive hearing loss, mixed hearing loss and single-sided sensorineural deafness (SSD).
The new Osia System offers the proven benefits as the current version: excellent hearing outcomes
, ease of use, discreetness and reliability
. With the introduction of the OSI300 Implant, it is the first and only active bone conduction system that allows patients to undergo MRI scans at both 1.5 T and 3.0 T without the need for surgery
. This new patient benefit is made possible by combining the unique properties of the Osia System's Piezo Power™ transducer, which does not contain magnetic material, and the next generation in implant magnet technology.
The OSI300 Implant is specifically designed to support access to MRI with no performance degradation after MRI exposure
, as there is nothing to be demagnetized as in an electromagnetic transducer. Unlike an axial magnet, which is found in most bone conduction implants today and is unsuitable for a patient undergoing an MRI examination at 3.0 T, the OSI300 uses a diametric magnet that sits within a casing and rotates to align with the magnetic field of the MRI machine.
"Not only does the new design allow for MRI scans at 3.0 T without surgery or the need for a headwrap or splint kit; we have also designed the magnet cassette to be simple to remove if needed. The easy removal of the implant magnet reduces image artifact, an important consideration for maximum visibility of areas around the implant. Both features mean less MRI preparation time and less time without sound, which is beneficial to both recipients and professionals," 
, Head of Portfolio Strategy & Professional Marketing at Cochlear, said.
Today, most people can expect to undergo an MRI scan at some point in their lifetime and having a hearing implant shouldn't be an obstacle to this important healthcare treatment option.
"The use of 3.0 T scanners is increasing and becoming more common. 3.0 T scanners help in the proper diagnosis of many neurologic, orthopedic and oncology conditions. It is important that patients don't face any obstacles to this type of care, and I am glad Cochlear has kept this in mind in their new Osia System," Dr. 
, SVP, Global Clinical Strategy & Innovation at Cochlear, Chairman of the Department of Otolaryngology, and Director of the Cochlear Implant Program at the Greater Baltimore Medical Center, said.
 is inspired by meaningful innovation and a core belief that technology is only as useful as the benefit it provides.
"An improvement in the ability of patients to undergo high-resolution MRI scans with our technology was the number one request we heard from customers. With the new system, patients with an active bone conduction system can conveniently undergo MRI at 1.5 T and at 3.0 T with no impact to their hearing – MRI should be accessible to everyone" says Dig Howitt, Chief Executive Officer & President of Cochlear.
Launched commercially in 2020, 
 is the world's first active osseointegrated bone conduction (OSI), a new category of bone conduction hearing solutions that uses digital piezoelectric stimulation to bypass damaged areas of the natural hearing system to send sound vibrations directly to the inner ear (cochlea).
The next generation of the Osia System will be available in clinics across 
 this fall and is currently being reviewed by Health Canada. Availability in other countries is subject to regulatory approvals.

Cochlear Limited's (ASX:COH) institutional investors lost 4.5% last week but have benefitted from longer-term gains

If you want to know who really controls Cochlear Limited (
), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 51% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.
Institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to AU$16b last week. However, the 29% one-year returns may have helped alleviate their overall losses. They should, however, be mindful of further losses in the future.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Cochlear.
Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.
As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Cochlear. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Cochlear's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.
Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Cochlear. The company's largest shareholder is BlackRock, Inc., with ownership of 6.8%. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 5.9% and 5.4%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.
On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.
I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.
Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Cochlear Limited in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own AU$63m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking 
The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 49% stake in Cochlear. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.
I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Investors in Cochlear (ASX:COH) have seen notable returns of 41% over the past five years

Stock pickers are generally looking for stocks that will outperform the broader market. And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, long term 
 (
) shareholders have enjoyed a 32% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 11% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 27% , including dividends .
So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns.
While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.
During the five years of share price growth, Cochlear moved from a loss to profitability. That's generally thought to be a genuine positive, so we would expect to see an increasing share price.
The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).
It's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our 
 
.
When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between 
 (TSR) and 
. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Cochlear's TSR for the last 5 years was 41%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!
It's good to see that Cochlear has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 27% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 7% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It is all well and good that insiders have been buying shares, but we suggest you 
Cochlear is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this

Cochlear (ASX:COH) Could Be Struggling To Allocate Capital

To find a multi-bagger stock, what are the underlying trends we should look for in a business? In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So when we looked at 
 (
), they do have a high ROCE, but we weren't exactly elated from how returns are trending.
If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Cochlear:
0.20 = AU$406m ÷ (AU$2.6b - AU$578m) 
.
Therefore, 
 That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 9.5% earned by companies in a similar industry.
Above you can see how the current ROCE for Cochlear compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our 
 
.
When we looked at the ROCE trend at Cochlear, we didn't gain much confidence. Historically returns on capital were even higher at 40%, but they have dropped over the last five years. However, given capital employed and revenue have both increased it appears that the business is currently pursuing growth, at the consequence of short term returns. If these investments prove successful, this can bode very well for long term stock performance.
In summary, despite lower returns in the short term, we're encouraged to see that Cochlear is reinvesting for growth and has higher sales as a result. And the stock has followed suit returning a meaningful 50% to shareholders over the last five years. So while the underlying trends could already be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.
Cochlear could be trading at an attractive price in other respects, so you might find our 
 on our platform quite valuable.

Unpleasant Surprises Could Be In Store For Cochlear Limited's (ASX:COH) Shares

 (
) price-to-earnings (or "P/E") ratio of 65.3x might make it look like a strong sell right now compared to the market in Australia, where around half of the companies have P/E ratios below 18x and even P/E's below 9x are quite common. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.
Recent times have been pleasing for Cochlear as its earnings have risen in spite of the market's earnings going into reverse. It seems that many are expecting the company to continue defying the broader market adversity, which has increased investors’ willingness to pay up for the stock. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason.
Keen to find out how analysts think Cochlear's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our 
.
In order to justify its P/E ratio, Cochlear would need to produce outstanding growth well in excess of the market.
Retrospectively, the last year delivered a decent 4.0% gain to the company's bottom line. Although, the latest three year period in total hasn't been as good as it didn't manage to provide any growth at all. Accordingly, shareholders probably wouldn't have been overly satisfied with the unstable medium-term growth rates.
Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 16% each year over the next three years. That's shaping up to be similar to the 18% per year growth forecast for the broader market.
With this information, we find it interesting that Cochlear is trading at a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly average growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. These shareholders may be setting themselves up for disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.
While the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.
We've established that Cochlear currently trades on a higher than expected P/E since its forecast growth is only in line with the wider market. When we see an average earnings outlook with market-like growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the high P/E lower. This places shareholders' investments at risk and potential investors in danger of paying an unnecessary premium.
The company's balance sheet is another key area for risk analysis. You can assess many of the main risks through our 
 with six simple checks.

Cochlear Limited (ASX:COH) Just Released Its Half-Yearly Earnings: Here's What Analysts Think

 (
) last week reported its latest half-yearly results, which makes it a good time for investors to dive in and see if the business is performing in line with expectations. Cochlear reported in line with analyst predictions, delivering revenues of AU$1.1b and statutory earnings per share of AU$2.91, suggesting the business is executing well and in line with its plan. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.
Taking into account the latest results, the current consensus from Cochlear's 16 analysts is for revenues of AU$2.28b in 2024. This would reflect a modest 6.0% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to climb 12% to AU$6.00. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of AU$2.26b and earnings per share (EPS) of AU$5.83 in 2024. The analysts seems to have become more bullish on the business, judging by their new earnings per share estimates.
There's been no major changes to the consensus price target of AU$281, suggesting that the improved earnings per share outlook is not enough to have a long-term positive impact on the stock's valuation. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. There are some variant perceptions on Cochlear, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at AU$330 and the most bearish at AU$220 per share. As you can see, analysts are not all in agreement on the stock's future, but the range of estimates is still reasonably narrow, which could suggest that the outcome is not totally unpredictable.
Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the 
. It's clear from the latest estimates that Cochlear's rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with the forecast 12% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2024 noticeably faster than its historical growth of 8.3% p.a. over the past five years. Other similar companies in the industry (with analyst coverage) are also forecast to grow their revenue at 11% per year. Cochlear is expected to grow at about the same rate as its industry, so it's not clear that we can draw any conclusions from its growth relative to competitors.
The biggest takeaway for us is the consensus earnings per share upgrade, which suggests a clear improvement in sentiment around Cochlear's earnings potential next year. They also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, with the company predicted to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.
Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for Cochlear going out to 2026, and you can

Another thing to consider is whether management and directors have been buying or selling stock recently. We provide an overview of all open market stock trades

Is Cochlear Limited's (ASX:COH) Recent Stock Performance Tethered To Its Strong Fundamentals?

Most readers would already be aware that Cochlear's (ASX:COH) stock increased significantly by 6.7% over the past month. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on 
 ROE.
ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Cochlear is:
17% = AU$301m ÷ AU$1.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).
The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every A$1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn A$0.17 in profit.
So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or "retains", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
To start with, Cochlear's ROE looks acceptable. Especially when compared to the industry average of 9.3% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. This certainly adds some context to Cochlear's decent 5.8% net income growth seen over the past five years.
Next, on comparing Cochlear's net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 5.8% over the last few years.
The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about Cochlear's's valuation, check out 
, as compared to its industry.
Cochlear has a significant three-year median payout ratio of 60%, meaning that it is left with only 40% to reinvest into its business. This implies that the company has been able to achieve decent earnings growth despite returning most of its profits to shareholders.
Moreover, Cochlear is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 69%. However, Cochlear's ROE is predicted to rise to 23% despite there being no anticipated change in its payout ratio.
On the whole, we feel that Cochlear's performance has been quite good. Especially the high ROE, Which has contributed to the impressive growth seen in earnings. Despite the company reinvesting only a small portion of its profits, it still has managed to grow its earnings so that is appreciable. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

Should You Be Adding Cochlear (ASX:COH) To Your Watchlist Today?

For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.
So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like 
 (
). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.
Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Impressively, Cochlear has grown EPS by 34% per year, compound, in the last three years. This has no doubt fuelled the optimism that sees the stock trading on a high multiple of earnings.
One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. EBIT margins for Cochlear remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 25% to AU$2.1b. That's encouraging news for the company!

It's said that there's no smoke without fire. For investors, insider buying is often the smoke that indicates which stocks could set the market alight. That's because insider buying often indicates that those closest to the company have confidence that the share price will perform well. Of course, we can never be sure what insiders are thinking, we can only judge their actions.
Not only did Cochlear insiders refrain from selling stock during the year, but they also spent AU$256k buying it. This is a good look for the company as it paints an optimistic picture for the future. Zooming in, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Independent Non-Executive Director Christine McLoughlin for AU$68k worth of shares, at about AU$271 per share.
Along with the insider buying, another encouraging sign for Cochlear is that insiders, as a group, have a considerable shareholding. Holding AU$87m worth of stock in the company is no laughing matter and insiders will be committed in delivering the best outcomes for shareholders. This should keep them focused on creating long term value for shareholders.
You can't deny that Cochlear has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. Furthermore, company insiders have been adding to their significant stake in the company. Astute investors will want to keep this stock on watch. One of Buffett's considerations when discussing businesses is if they are capital light or capital intensive. Generally, a company with a high return on equity is capital light, and can thus fund growth more easily. So you might want to check

The good news is that Cochlear is not the only growth stock with insider buying. Here's

Cochlear Ltd's Dividend Analysis

Cochlear Ltd (
) recently announced a 
 of $0.66 per share, payable on 2024-04-30, with the ex-dividend date set for 2024-03-21. As investors look forward to this upcoming payment, the spotlight also shines on the company's dividend history, yield, and growth rates. Using the data from GuruFocus, let's look into Cochlear Ltd's dividend performance and assess its sustainability.
Cochlear Ltd is the leading cochlear implant device manufacturer with around 60% global market share. Developed markets contribute 80% of group revenue where cochlear implants are the standard of care for children with severe to profound hearing loss. The company also actively targets the growing cohort of seniors in developed markets. Tender-oriented emerging markets contribute the remaining 20% of group revenue. Main products include cochlear implants, bone-anchored hearing aids, and associated sound processors. In fiscal 2020, 49% of revenue came from the Americas, 35% from Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, and 16% from the Asia-Pacific segment.
Cochlear Ltd has maintained a consistent 
 record since 2010. Dividends are currently distributed on a bi-annually basis. Below is a chart showing annual 
 for tracking historical trends.
As of today, Cochlear Ltd currently has a 12-month 
 of 1.00% and a 12-month 
 of 1.12%. This suggests an expectation of increased dividend payments over the next 12 months.
Over the past three years, Cochlear Ltd's annual 
 was 19.70%. Extended to a five-year horizon, this rate decreased to -0.80% per year. And over the past decade, Cochlear Ltd's annual dividends per share growth rate stands at -0.50%. Based on Cochlear Ltd's dividend yield and five-year growth rate, the 
 of Cochlear Ltd stock as of today is approximately 0.96%.
To assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The 
 provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-12-31, Cochlear Ltd's dividend payout ratio is 0.62.
Cochlear Ltd's 
, offers an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers. GuruFocus ranks Cochlear Ltd's profitability 7 out of 10 as of 2023-12-31, suggesting good profitability prospects. The company has reported net profit in 9 years out of past 10 years.
To ensure the sustainability of dividends, a company must have robust growth metrics. Cochlear Ltd's 
 of 7 out of 10 suggests that the company's growth trajectory is good relative to its competitors.
Revenue is the lifeblood of any company, and Cochlear Ltd's 
, combined with the 
, indicates a strong revenue model. Cochlear Ltd's revenue has increased by approximately 9.90% per year on average, a rate that outperforms approximately 55.88% of global competitors.
In conclusion, Cochlear Ltd's upcoming dividend, consistent payment history, and a moderate yield present an attractive proposition for income-focused investors. While the dividend growth rate has experienced fluctuations, the company's payout ratio and profitability suggest a balance between rewarding shareholders and retaining earnings for growth. The growth rank and revenue trends further reinforce Cochlear Ltd's position in the market, potentially offering a sustainable dividend outlook. Investors seeking to diversify their portfolio with dividend-paying stocks may find Cochlear Ltd an interesting candidate, especially considering its dominant market position and financial health.

Cochlear calls for action in Washington D.C. ahead of World Hearing Day

, 
 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, 
 assembled a team of hearing experts to emphasize the importance of hearing health for policy makers at the Australian Embassy in 
 ahead of World Hearing Day on 
.
According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), one in every three people 65 years of age and one in every two 75 years of age and over has hearing loss.
 The event introduced ways to educate not only those in attendance, but the public, to better understand hearing, how it changes over time and the importance of treatment, including the introduction of the 
 by Dr. 
, Director, Cochlear Center for Hearing and Public Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
Echoing Dr. Lin's education messaging, panelist 
, Executive Director of The
 spoke about changing mindsets, urging Americans to protect hearing in noisy environments, check hearing with regular exams and treat hearing loss as soon as possible.
Most people know their basic medical information as they age including height, weight, vision and even blood pressure, but one that is left off all too often is hearing, which can have consequences. The Hearing Number hopes to help medical professionals and patients act sooner. Untreated hearing loss can impact a person's brain health, balance, speech and overall quality of life.
The sentiment of the importance of understanding how hearing effects healthy aging was highlighted by the moderator of the event, Dr. 
, SVP, Global Clinical Strategy & Innovation at Cochlear, Chairman of the Department of Otolaryngology, and Director of the Cochlear Implant Program at the Greater Baltimore Medical Center.
"If left unaddressed, hearing loss poses significant challenges to overall health and can be progressive, leading to greater hearing loss over time. Research has shown untreated hearing loss is connected to increased social isolation and loneliness, balance issues and risk for falls, and there's emerging evidence associating untreated hearing loss with diminished brain health and mental sharpness as well," Dr. Kaplan said.
Someone who knows all too well the impact of hearing loss and is passionate about educating others on the help he received is 
, the former Vice President of Research & Development and Planning for General Motors who suddenly lost his hearing in 1992 and was a panelist at the event today talking about the importance of his hearing treatment with cochlear implants.
"I could feel myself slowly isolating more and more after I lost my hearing. It got to the point where I wouldn't go out to dinner with my family because it was just too hard and I was often questioning if I would ever reach my full potential," Burns said.
"After I took action and received my first cochlear implant in 1993, my life absolutely changed for the better. It helped me get back to fully engaging all aspects of my life from work to family, to basic tasks. The biggest impact that I can reflect on now is that it gave me my independence back, which I will never take for granted," he said.
Burns' story of isolation due to hearing loss is all too common, more than 37 million (15%) Americans have hearing loss.
"There are too many people out there suffering that don't know there are treatments available to bring them back into the hearing world. Assembling this group today is one step to bringing awareness and action to this issue. We hope the introduction of the Hearing Number will better equip the public with the necessary tools to assess their hearing and seek treatment when needed," 
, President of Cochlear Americas, said.
"Our goal and what we challenge those here today to do is implement a standard of care and peer support, ensuring equitable access to treatment and care for every child and adult with hearing loss to improve their quality of life."
The event opened with remarks from 
. Moderated by 
SVP, Global Clinical Strategy & Innovation at Cochlear, Chairman of the Department of Otolaryngology, and Director of the Cochlear Implant Program at the Greater Baltimore Medical Center, the event included a panel of experts at the Australian Embassy which included 
Director, Cochlear Center for Hearing and Public Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health
the executive director of the Hearing Loss Association of America (HLAA)
a Cochlear recipient and former Vice President of Research & Development and Planning for General Motors.
People have always been Cochlear's inspiration, ever since Professor

Investing in Cochlear (ASX:COH) five years ago would have delivered you a 104% gain

Stock pickers are generally looking for stocks that will outperform the broader market. And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. For example, long term 
 (
) shareholders have enjoyed a 91% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 25% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 49% , including dividends .
With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.
There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.
During the last half decade, Cochlear became profitable. That would generally be considered a positive, so we'd expect the share price to be up.
The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).
We like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. This 
 interactive report on Cochlear's 
 is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.
When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between 
 (TSR) and 
. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Cochlear the TSR over the last 5 years was 104%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!
It's nice to see that Cochlear shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 49% over the last year. That's including the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 15% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It is all well and good that insiders have been buying shares, but we suggest you 
Cochlear is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find

Cochlear (ASX:COH) May Have Issues Allocating Its Capital

If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Having said that, while the ROCE is currently high for 
 (
), we aren't jumping out of our chairs because returns are decreasing.
For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Cochlear is:
0.23 = AU$472m ÷ (AU$2.5b - AU$517m) 
.
So, 
 In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Medical Equipment industry average of 9.3%.
In the above chart we have measured Cochlear's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our 
 
.
When we looked at the ROCE trend at Cochlear, we didn't gain much confidence. To be more specific, while the ROCE is still high, it's fallen from 39% where it was five years ago. Although, given both revenue and the amount of assets employed in the business have increased, it could suggest the company is investing in growth, and the extra capital has led to a short-term reduction in ROCE. If these investments prove successful, this can bode very well for long term stock performance.
Even though returns on capital have fallen in the short term, we find it promising that revenue and capital employed have both increased for Cochlear. Furthermore the stock has climbed 79% over the last five years, it would appear that investors are upbeat about the future. So while the underlying trends could already be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.
While Cochlear doesn't shine too bright in this respect, it's still worth seeing if the company is trading at attractive prices. You can find that out with our

Cochlear Limited's (ASX:COH) Stock Been Rising: Are Strong Financials Guiding The Market?

Most readers would already know that Cochlear's (ASX:COH) stock increased by 1.5% over the past month. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. In this article, we decided to focus on 
 ROE.
Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Cochlear is:
20% = AU$350m ÷ AU$1.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).
The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every A$1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn A$0.20 in profit.
Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or "retains" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.
To begin with, Cochlear seems to have a respectable ROE. Especially when compared to the industry average of 7.7% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. This probably laid the ground for Cochlear's moderate 14% net income growth seen over the past five years.
We then compared Cochlear's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 5.6% in the same 5-year period.
Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to 
, relative to its industry.
Cochlear has a significant three-year median payout ratio of 72%, meaning that it is left with only 28% to reinvest into its business. This implies that the company has been able to achieve decent earnings growth despite returning most of its profits to shareholders.
Additionally, Cochlear has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 69%. Regardless, the future ROE for Cochlear is predicted to rise to 25% despite there being not much change expected in its payout ratio.
Overall, we are quite pleased with Cochlear's performance. We are particularly impressed by the considerable earnings growth posted by the company, which was likely backed by its high ROE. While the company is paying out most of its earnings as dividends, it has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's probably a good sign. We also studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that the company's earnings growth is expected be similar to its current growth rate. To know more about the company's future earnings growth forecasts take a look at this

Cochlear concludes Oticon Medical cochlear implant acquisition

Hearing solutions provider Cochlear has concluded the acquisition of the Oticon Medical cochlear implant business from Demant.
The transaction, which involved no headline purchase price, marks the end of Demant's involvement in the hearing implants business.
Cochlear is set to integrate the acquired business over the coming months, with integration costs for fiscal year 2024 (FY 2024) estimated at around A$30m pre-tax.
The integration expenditures, primarily associated with restructuring, will be reported as a non-recurring significant item.
However, this will not affect Cochlear’s underlying net profit guidance for FY 2024, which is projected to be between A$385m and A$400m.
Cochlear agreed to purchase Oticon Medical in April 2022 for approximately A$170m after Demant decided to withdraw from the hearing implants market.
As part of the 2022 deal, Cochlear pledged to continue supporting Oticon Medical's extensive user base, which includes over 75,000 recipients of cochlear and acoustic implants.
The funding for this acquisition was sourced from Cochlear's existing cash reserves.
Cochlear CEO and president Dig Howitt said: “We welcome Oticon Medical’s cochlear implant customers to Cochlear and remain committed to supporting the long-term hearing outcomes of these 20,000 patients.
“We will develop and commercialise next-generation sound processors and services to enable the vast majority of customers to transition to Cochlear’s technology platform over time. We will also support customers with continued access to repairs and replacements of current Oticon Medical cochlear implant technology for as long as feasible.”
Last month, Cochlear received the US Food and Drug Administration 
 to children as young as five years old.
This decision lowers the eligible age from 12 years to five, allowing younger children with conductive hearing loss, mixed hearing loss, and single-sided sensorineural deafness to benefit from the technology.
"Cochlear concludes Oticon Medical cochlear implant acquisition" was originally created and published by

What Makes CochLear Ltd. Unsponsored ADR (CHEOY) a New Buy Stock

CochLear Ltd. Unsponsored ADR (CHEOY) appears an attractive pick, as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.
Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.
Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for CochLear Ltd. Unsponsored ADR basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.
The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.
For CochLear Ltd. Unsponsored ADR, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.
The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.
This company is expected to earn $2.35 per share for the fiscal year ending June 2025, which represents a year-over-year change of 50.6%.
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for CochLear Ltd. Unsponsored ADR. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 2.6%.
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.
You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>
The upgrade of CochLear Ltd. Unsponsored ADR to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.

Institutions along with retail investors who hold considerable shares inCochlear Limited (ASX:COH) come under pressure; lose 3.3% of holdings value

Every investor in Cochlear Limited (
) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are retail investors with 54% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.
While institutions who own 45% came under pressure after market cap dropped to AU$21b last week,retail investors took the most losses.
Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Cochlear.
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Cochlear. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Cochlear's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
Hedge funds don't have many shares in Cochlear. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is BlackRock, Inc. with 6.8% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 5.9% and 5.4% of the stock.
On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.
The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.
Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.
Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Cochlear Limited in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own AU$83m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking 
The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a substantial 54% stake in Cochlear, suggesting it is a fairly popular stock. With this amount of ownership, retail investors can collectively play a role in decisions that affect shareholder returns, such as dividend policies and the appointment of directors. They can also exercise the power to vote on acquisitions or mergers that may not improve profitability.
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.
