: the company is being positioned to provide a leveraged opportunity to participate in all phases of the expected upswing in uranium prices. Management’s Dual Pillar strategy is designed to deliver both organic and inorganic growth by advancing the company’s Namibian and Australian projects through the production stage and by acquiring additional projects as the industry consolidates. 
, defined as a multi-project producer of uranium with the capacity to deliver 5-10 million lbs. of uranium annually.
CEO John Borshoff and his team previously achieved the same accomplishment with Paladin Energy Ltd by acquiring, developing and advancing the Langer Heinrich deposit into production within four years (2002-2006) and the Kayelekera Mine in Malawi (production 2009 to 2013) during the last uranium up cycle.
The Langer Heinrich uranium mine is situated 30km northeast of the Tumas Project. Deep Yellow’s executive team acquired, defined, funded, developed, optimized and operated Langer Heinrich from 2002 to 2017. The geology and type of deposit mineralization in these paleochannel systems at Langer Heinrich and Tumas are quite similar, and the mining jurisdiction is one in the same. Management is well-prepared to fast-track Tumas to production during this uranium up-cycle.
The company’s most advanced flagship project is the

. We also expect management to pursue additional acquisitions and/or mergers as the uranium consolidates during the current upcycle.
During fiscal 2023, management impressively advanced all of the company’s uranium projects through exploration programs, in-fill drilling and/or upgrades in the project’s MRE. The company is on the path to commence uranium production as early as 2026 (at Tumas).

In addition, the project’s financing activities commenced with a target for the Final Investment Decision during the second half of FY2024 with the development/construction of a mine to follow in the 2024-2025 timeframe.
Between March and August 2023, Deep Yellow conducted a 2-phase 340-hole (9,500m) 
west of Tumas 3 in order to expand the current resource base with a goal of increasing the LOM of the Tumas Project to over 30 years. A prospective 2.5km x 1.8km area west of Tumas 3. Was identified for infill drilling (hole spacing of 100m). We await the results of the drill program.
Concerning the

Leading market research firms on the nuclear industry forecast that the deficit between primary supply (from mines) and the demand by nuclear reactors will continue to expand through 2040. In its reference scenario, the 
 calculates that the annual primary supply deficit for uranium will exceed 140 million pounds by 2030. Furthermore, in its Base case, 
 estimates that between 2023 and 2040, the needs of operating nuclear reactors will increase by 35%. Both scenarios indicate that new primary production will be needed with the price of uranium being the key determent that will incentivize the development of new mines.

 due to population growth, the modernization of emerging & developing nations, the adoption of EVs and the growing desire to attain Net-Zero Carbon Emissions targets. According to the latest International Energy Agency (IEA) report, global electricity demand continues to grow with electricity generated from fossil fuels expected to decline and electricity generated from renewables anticipated to expand.
Countries such as China, India, Spain, Finland, Sweden and the U.S. have and continue to

The uranium industry is composed of many companies, from major established producers to more speculative junior exploration companies. Though larger producers tend to have greater resources to navigate periods of depressed market conditions, junior companies provide greater leverage to the rise in uranium prices.
Almost all uranium stocks should benefit from the anticipated growth of much needed primary supply driven by the expected upcoming fundamental supply deficit; however, certain groups of uranium stocks benefit differently from each stage of the up-cycle. Historically (observing the 2001-2007 up-cycle), current producers reacted well to the 
 (since their current production could immediately benefit from the increase in the price of uranium), and they significantly outperformed the price of the commodity, itself. However, extreme out-sized returns were enjoyed by junior mining companies that traded below $0.25 per share at the bottom.
Then, there was a 
 when the rate of increase of the spot price of uranium moderated to a single-digit rate. In this period, junior mining companies corrected in the 40%-to-50% (sometimes multiple times), while producers corrected about half that amount (around 25%).
In the current uranium cycle, the advent of 
has aided the growing demand/supply imbalance by removing supply from the market. Their combined stockpiles now total over 100 million pounds. Currently, these uranium investment vehicles do not have formal redemption mechanisms. As uranium prices rise, there will be the potential for these funds to release supply into the market, triggering one of several expected 40%-to-50% corrections in the uranium space.
Broadly speaking, the public uranium companies can be grouped into three segments: producers, development companies and exploration companies. Producers are actively mining and generating revenues. Exploration companies are prospecting and/or drilling to establish mineral resources. In between these two segments are the development companies that already have established resources and are advancing through the process to bring a mine in operation, generally from the point of initiating a Pre-Feasibility Study to the actual construction of a mine. The comparable companies to Deep Yellow fall into this category.
Further, the comparable companies have been narrowed through quantitative factors, particularly those with a market capitalization over $350 million and trading above $0.75 per share. This process captures a range of well-funded junior uranium development companies, which are listed in the table above. Currently, the P/B valuation range of these comparable companies is between 3.58 and 8.68. With the expectation that Deep Yellow’s stock will attain a mid-second quartile P/B ratio of 6.3, our comparable analysis valuation price target is US$2.00.

Deep Yellow Limited's (ASX:DYL) top owners are retail investors with 60% stake, while 26% is held by institutions 2023-12-09T22:35:41.000Z

If you want to know who really controls Deep Yellow Limited (
), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 60% to be precise, is retail investors. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
Institutions, on the other hand, account for 26% of the company's stockholders. Institutions will often hold stock in bigger companies, and we expect to see insiders owning a noticeable percentage of the smaller ones.
Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Deep Yellow, beginning with the chart below.
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
Deep Yellow already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Deep Yellow's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.
Deep Yellow is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Paradice Investment Management Pty Ltd. with 8.0% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 6.9% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.3% by the third-largest shareholder. Additionally, the company's CEO John Borshoff directly holds 2.0% of the total shares outstanding.
On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.
While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in Deep Yellow Limited. As individuals, the insiders collectively own AU$66m worth of the AU$766m company. This shows at least some alignment. You can 
The general public -- including retail investors -- own 60% of Deep Yellow. With this amount of ownership, retail investors can collectively play a role in decisions that affect shareholder returns, such as dividend policies and the appointment of directors. They can also exercise the power to vote on acquisitions or mergers that may not improve profitability.
It seems that Private Companies own 5.3%, of the Deep Yellow stock. Private companies may be related parties. Sometimes insiders have an interest in a public company through a holding in a private company, rather than in their own capacity as an individual. While it's hard to draw any broad stroke conclusions, it is worth noting as an area for further research.
It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Deep Yellow better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified 
 that you should be aware of.

Will Deep Yellow (ASX:DYL) Spend Its Cash Wisely? 2024-02-05T01:03:30.000Z

There's no doubt that money can be made by owning shares of unprofitable businesses. For example, 
 (
) shareholders have done very well over the last year, with the share price soaring by 113%. But the harsh reality is that very many loss making companies burn through all their cash and go bankrupt.
Given its strong share price performance, we think it's worthwhile for Deep Yellow shareholders to consider whether its cash burn is concerning. In this report, we will consider the company's annual negative free cash flow, henceforth referring to it as the 'cash burn'. First, we'll determine its cash runway by comparing its cash burn with its cash reserves.
A company's cash runway is calculated by dividing its cash hoard by its cash burn. As at June 2023, Deep Yellow had cash of AU$41m and no debt. Looking at the last year, the company burnt through AU$33m. That means it had a cash runway of around 15 months as of June 2023. While that cash runway isn't too concerning, sensible holders would be peering into the distance, and considering what happens if the company runs out of cash. Depicted below, you can see how its cash holdings have changed over time.
Whilst it's great to see that Deep Yellow has already begun generating revenue from operations, last year it only produced AU$38k, so we don't think it is generating significant revenue, at this point. As a result, we think it's a bit early to focus on the revenue growth, so we'll limit ourselves to looking at how the cash burn is changing over time. In fact, it ramped its spending strongly over the last year, increasing cash burn by 176%. That sort of spending growth rate can't continue for very long before it causes balance sheet weakness, generally speaking. Clearly, however, the crucial factor is whether the company will grow its business going forward. For that reason, it makes a lot of sense to take a look at 
.
Given its cash burn trajectory, Deep Yellow shareholders may wish to consider how easily it could raise more cash, despite its solid cash runway. Companies can raise capital through either debt or equity. Commonly, a business will sell new shares in itself to raise cash and drive growth. By comparing a company's annual cash burn to its total market capitalisation, we can estimate roughly how many shares it would have to issue in order to run the company for another year (at the same burn rate).
Deep Yellow has a market capitalisation of AU$1.3b and burnt through AU$33m last year, which is 2.6% of the company's market value. That means it could easily issue a few shares to fund more growth, and might well be in a position to borrow cheaply.
On this analysis of Deep Yellow's cash burn, we think its cash burn relative to its market cap was reassuring, while its increasing cash burn has us a bit worried. Cash burning companies are always on the riskier side of things, but after considering all of the factors discussed in this short piece, we're not too worried about its rate of cash burn. On another note, Deep Yellow has

OTCQX:DYLLF | ASX:DYL
 management has positioned the company to provide a leveraged opportunity to participate in an expected upswing in uranium prices. Management’s Dual Pillar strategy is designed to deliver both organic and inorganic growth by advancing the company’s Namibian and Australian projects through the production stage and when attractive opportunities arise, by acquiring additional projects as the industry consolidates. 
 defined as a multi-project producer of uranium with the capacity to deliver 5-10 million lbs. of uranium annually.
In addition to advancements at the Tumas Project, along with the Mulga Rock and Alligator River Projects, during the first half of fiscal 2024 (see HALF YEAR INTERIM REPORT section below), the company benefitted from a

The net proceeds will be used:
1) to continue to advance the Tumas Project toward production
2) to allow for further development activities at the Mulga Rock Project, including a revised DFS
3) to fund other resource expansion activities through exploration at Alligator River & Omahola
4)to augment working capital
Deep Yellow is poised to enter a crucial stage in the company's lifecycle, specifically, 
, which will require financings or capital raises. This initial significant equity financing provides the necessary capital to move forward to the Final Investment Decision (FID) for the Tumas Project.
The AUD$250 million in capital was raised through a 
 (AUD$220 million) that was completed in two tranches (one in mid-March and the other in early-May), which in total consisted of the issuance of 
 at an issue price of AUD$1.225 per share. Additionally, 
 were issued to existing shareholders through a Share Purchase Plan, also at an issue price of AUD$1.225 per share. 
, requiring a pro-rata scale-back of the applications for shares.
Of note, during 2024, 
, most because of participation in the private placement. The entities were Macquarie Group Limited (March 13th), State Street Corporation (March 15th) MM Asset Management of Toronto (April 29th) and Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Limited (January 4th and March 25th).
Furthermore, through discussions with financiers, the company is progressing toward securing debt financing that will help fund construction costs of the Tumas uranium mine once the FID is made to proceed, which is expected to be announced near the end of the third calendar quarter of 2024. Typically, debt issued for mine construction is secured by the assets and/or future cash flows of the project.
In mid-April, Deep Yellow filed its

On February 29, 2024, an 
 commenced at Tumas 3 with the objectives to both upgrade and increase the Project’s MRE, while simultaneously bolstering the company’s financing effort to bring the Tumas mine to production. The goal is to define adequate Proven Reserves within the pit locations defined within the Tumas DFS for the mine to operate for initial six (6) years of operation.

 also commenced at the end of February, and as of the end of March, six (6) diamond drill holes (144m) and 189 RC holes (4,221m) had been completed. The entire drilling campaign is anticipated to be completed in June 2024.
 
Metallurgical test work for the Tumas Project continues. 
 has resulted in a material reduction in energy requirements, which is expected to reduce operating costs. 
, particularly by increasing the permeate yield and achieving a higher selectivity, which results in higher throughput of uranium, vanadium and reagents. These performance improvements should improve the Project’s NPV.
In December 2023, the Tumas Definitive Feasibility Study Re-Costing Study was completed, which updated the 
 U308 (a conservative increase considering the spot price has exceeded US$100/lb.) and adjusted the initial cost estimates to reflect the moderating rate of inflation and an abatement of the supply chain pressures. 
During the third fiscal quarter, the process of selecting an Engineering, Procurement, and Construction Management 
 commenced. The EPCM provider is expected to be selected during the fourth fiscal quarter. The detailed engineering phase should commence almost immediately thereafter and require about six (6) months to complete. It is anticipated that the Project will be further optimized when drilling results and subsequent re-estimation of reserves are received.

The decrease in the Inferred resource was a result of an overall upgrade of previously lower-grade material into the Indicated category. The updated MRE included drilling results from the 656-hole (36,647m) air core drill program completed in August 2023.
The 2018 DFS had uranium recovery rates in the 85.9%-to-89.6% range with no recovery assumed for critical minerals and only around 20% for base metals.
A revised DFS that will optimize the mining method, which will potentially include the recovery of critical minerals, is being undertaken with a completion date anticipated to be in the third calendar quarter of 2025.
Since the announcement of the 27% increase of the MRE for the Angularli Deposit at Alligator River Project in mid-2023, a heritage survey on EL5893 was conducted in the fourth calendar quarter of 2023, which resulted in conditional approval to explore areas north of Angularli. During the third fiscal quarter, desktop studies continue to delineate prospective corridors, including combining and merging radiometric, magnetic, and gravity data to produce geophysical images that will help identify prospective corridors. A drone-borne high-resolution magnetic and radiometric survey is being planned.

. Furthermore, at COP28 (28th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), which took place in Dubai between November 30 to December 12, 2023, 22 countries pledged to triple the nuclear capacity by 2050.
In 2023, the spot uranium price increased 90.9% from US$47.68/lb. to US$91.00/lb. On January 17, 2024, the spot uranium price spiked up to US$106.50/lb., a 17-year high. Meanwhile, Deep Yellow’s stock (OTCQX: DYLLF) rallied over 57.4% from $0.465 to $0.732 in 2023, and a further 53.0% to $1.12 thus far in 2024. The outlook for uranium market continues to be strong with demand exceeding supply for the foreseeable future.
Leading market research firms on the nuclear industry forecast that the deficit between primary supply (from mines) and the demand by nuclear reactors will continue to expand through 2040. In its reference scenario, the 
 calculates that the annual primary supply deficit for uranium will exceed 140 million pounds by 2030. Furthermore, in its Base case, UxC estimates that between 2023 and 2040, the needs of operating nuclear reactors will increase by 35%. Both scenarios indicate that new primary production will be needed with the price of uranium being the key determent that will incentivize the development of new mines.

Broadly speaking, the public uranium companies can be grouped into three segments: producers, development companies and exploration companies. Producers are actively mining and generating revenues. Exploration companies are prospecting and/or drilling to establish mineral resources. In between these two segments are the development companies that already have established resources and are advancing through the process to bring a mine in operation, generally from the point of initiating a Pre-Feasibility Study to the actual construction of a mine. The comparable companies to Deep Yellow fall into this category.
Further, the comparable companies have been narrowed through quantitative factors, particularly those with a market capitalization over $500 million and trading above $1.00 per share. This process captures a range of well-funded junior uranium development companies, which are listed in the table above. Currently, the P/B valuation range of these comparable companies is between 4.64 and 6.53. With the expectation that Deep Yellow’s stock will attain an industry average quartile P/B ratio of 5.9, our comparable analysis valuation price target is US$2.50.

With 54% institutional ownership, Deep Yellow Limited (ASX:DYL) is a favorite amongst the big guns 2024-06-04T23:56:12.000Z

A look at the shareholders of Deep Yellow Limited (
) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 54% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).
Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Deep Yellow.
Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.
Deep Yellow already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Deep Yellow's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Deep Yellow. Paradice Investment Management Pty Ltd. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 7.2% of shares outstanding. With 6.3% and 5.3% of the shares outstanding respectively, ALPS Advisors, Inc. and Mirae Asset Global Investments Co., Ltd. are the second and third largest shareholders. Furthermore, CEO John Borshoff is the owner of 1.8% of the company's shares.
After doing some more digging, we found that the top 12 have the combined ownership of 52% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
We can report that insiders do own shares in Deep Yellow Limited. It is a pretty big company, so it is generally a positive to see some potentially meaningful alignment. In this case, they own around AU$115m worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking 
The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 38% stake in Deep Yellow. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks for example - Deep Yellow has

Ausenco wins EPCM contract for Deep Yellow’s Namibia uranium mine 2024-06-05T10:46:37.000Z

Australia-based uranium developer Deep Yellow has selected Ausenco Services as the preferred contractor to manage the detailed engineering and EPCM services for its Tumas project in Namibia.
This development marks a significant step towards the establishment of the Tumas site as the fourth uranium mine in the country.
Ausenco is well-acquainted with the project having completed the definitive feasibility study in February 2023 and a re-costing addendum in December 2023.
Its extensive knowledge is expected to be a valuable asset in the project's progression.
The parties will reach a detailed engineering agreement to progress essential workstreams in anticipation of the FID.
The full EPCM contract will be finalised post-FID, laying the groundwork for the commencement of operations in 2026.
Deep Yellow expects the successful delivery of the Tumas project by Ausenco to not only mark the company's first mining operation but also to be a flagship development that will contribute significantly to Namibia's mining sector.
The company’s Tumas project has 132.9mlb of U308 in uranium deposits of the calcrete/palaeochannel type.
Tertiary and Quaternary fluvial sediments that occupy narrow, steep-sided palaeochannels host carnotite, the kind of uranium mineralisation seen in calcrete-type deposits and palaeochannels.
The host rocks range in texture from poorly consolidated and friable sands to strong, carbonate-cemented sandstones and conglomerates (calcrete).
Deep Yellow managing director and CEO John Borshoff said: “The selection of Ausenco as the preferred EPCM contractor for the Tumas project is a significant project milestone.
“Ausenco is a market-leading engineering firm, highly regarded within the industry for their technical ability and track record of project delivery.
“Having Ausenco on board will complement the project delivery team to add significant value to the exciting Tumas project, in a period of extended positive outlook in the uranium supply sector.”

Fireside Chat with John Borshoff, Managing Director and CEO of Deep Yellow Ltd. 2024-06-27T10:52:00.000Z

OTC:DYLLF
 Good day. This is Steven Ralston at Zacks Small Cap Research, and I'm here with John Borshoff, CEO of Deep Yellow. Hello, John. Thank you for giving us the time for the CEO chat.
Thanks, Steve. Pleasure to be here.
 In the time we have together, I'd like to discuss Deep Yellow's most advanced uranium projects, Tumas and Mulga Rock. First I'd like to address Tumas, which currently has a timetable for commencing production in late 2026. You have traveled this journey before, as you and your team advanced Paladin to production in the 2003-2007 timeframe, and in the same jurisdiction, very similar palaeochannel deposits. Obviously, you're well up the learning curve in addressing the stages of development for Tumas. Could you compare and contrast the path here at Tumas with your experience at Paladin?
 Yes, Steven, I will do that. Before I do this, though, I just want to just give a little bit of background in terms of the how I've positioned Deep Yellow and the similarities of that to what I did in Paladin. In Paladin when I started to do a contrarian approach and developing a project pipeline at a time when uranium wasn't looking hot at all. By that time, before the China phenomenon happened, I had two projects in the pipeline. Greenfield was ready for development in Langer Heinrich and Kayelekera. This type of forward planning, where we didn't anticipate the exact timing of China's involvement, just galvanized our positioning.
 We became an investment phenomena. This was a result of that positioning which nobody else in the sector had done. So, come forward now 15 years and look at where Deep Yellow is. Remarkably, we are in a similar position this time. I took a contrarian approach because I really believe the opportunity lay in the fact that the sector is suffering from a shortage of uranium mine builders. And it's due to many reasons, where expertise disappeared and basically most companies and their projects went on standstill. So in getting Deep Yellow to where it is today, what we have got is two Greenfield projects ready for development over the next three to four years in Tumas and Mulga Rock.
 But in parallel with that, one of the biggest parts of asset development has been bringing the core team from Paladin, which was the only company to develop conventional uranium mines over the previous 25 years. And so the asset was Deep Yellow, which is the team we're familiar with. It's not just geological. It's not just developmental or operational. It's governance, financing, and all of the key attributes needed for uranium mining are within Deep Yellow. That's the number one achievement we have accomplished quietly, with purpose and vision. When you look at the world today, there is a serious lack of Greenfield projects ready for development with teams that can demonstrably develop and have credibility. That's point number one.
 So, one experience that I had and introduced into Deep Yellow, which I had successfully applied with Paladin, is our current approach. We aimed to marry, merge, and get a very thorough DFS out by February 2023. Then, having the fortitude and vision, we decided to re-cost that six months later, which proved to be a very good move. The reason for the re-costing was that the February 2023 DFS faced headwinds from inflation and supply chain issues. Even though about 75% of the DFS was based on tenders rather than just factoring, these headwinds added extra costs. We included them in the DFS because our purpose was not just to create a showpiece for shareholders, but to present something we knew we had to honor and develop. Our goal is to become a major producer in the sector.
 To eliminate any doubt about the DFS, we spent a considerable amount of money in conjunction with the project engineer and our team, which provides all the process IPs and everything. We re-examined the CapEx and OpEx, and re-costed them as an addendum to the DFS, signed off by the project engineer, making it fully auditable. As a result, we reduced the CapEx by about $20 million USD. The OpEx came in slightly higher, but it wasn't significant enough to change things overall. This higher OpEx absorbed a 12% increase in fuel costs and a 10% increase in power costs.
 So in fact, our old DFS had the OpEx about right, which helped eliminate concerns or doubts that a financier might have. They might have looked at it and thought, 'Oh, this is what they were talking about.' This caution likely comes from our experience with Langer. We now better understand how financiers think. These financiers have been involved with us previously, so we have a track record of honoring our commitments. We've placed a bigger emphasis on tendering the EPCM contract, ensuring we get the best out of it. We need an EPCM contractor capable of delivering on schedule, on price, and on cost, aiming for production in 2026.
 So, we've invested a lot of effort into this. We've selected our detailed engineer who will handle the engineering and EPCM. This has been announced, and now we're focusing on what they call the SP1 component, which involves feed or detailed engineering, and the SP2 component, which is the actual construction execution. We are currently enhancing the organic structure of our management approach from our side, ensuring alignment between what the engineer perceives and what we understand on our end. This prevents surprises like suddenly discovering midway through that there's an additional $50 million in costs due to discrepancies between on-site activities and documentation.
Our efforts in advancing our financing have been substantial. We've integrated key personnel from Paladin into our group, and we're on the verge of announcing a mandate with a bank, which is progressing smoothly. One critical aspect we're examining is the optimal leverage against the cost of equity. Preserving the upside potential of our contracts and offtake agreements is paramount to ensure maximum shareholder benefit. We now have a more refined owners team in place, focusing on co-managing the design approval process and integrating operational experts who will remain integral to the project's ongoing success. I hope that clarifies things for you.
Yes. And thank you for those insights on the Tumas project. We could now move to the Mulga Rock project. Earlier this year Deep Yellow released updated MRE on two deposits that are at Mulga Rock. And for the first time, it included estimates of critical minerals, namely copper, nickel, cobalt, zinc, and rare earths. It increased the estimate by 85%. I understand we should expect and revise DFS that will optimize the mining methods for the recovery of these critical minerals. What else is being planned to contribute to this revised DFS, which we expect in a little over a year from now?
 Right. During our due diligence on Vimy, the previous owners of Mulga Rock, we identified potential upside that we felt was not fully captured in their 2018 DFS, which serves as the core technical document. There was also a subsequent promotional refresh of the DFS that lacked authoritative backing. The landscape for uranium has evolved significantly from the post-Fukushima era of 2010-2011 through 2018 to 2022-2023. The parameters on which Vimy's DFS was based no longer aligned with the current realities. For instance, critical and battery minerals, as well as rare earths, were not major considerations back then.
 So, Vimy focused primarily on addressing environmental concerns and extracting easily leachable base metals, which they intended to explore further in their subsequent bankable feasibility study. Our analysis revealed significant upside potential, both in interpreting the ore body and in how Vimy's extensive drilling and test work could be leveraged. While their integrity in data collection was not in question, we identified additional potential in uranium. It's worth noting that the project remains fundamentally a standalone uranium venture, a perspective we continue to uphold.
 And so, following the merger, we explored value addition through critical minerals and rare earths, revealing significant upside potential. Our preliminary assessments confirmed this, suggesting a transformative impact on the project's longevity and value. Since August 2022, and ongoing, four key components are shaping our revised DFS. Firstly, the mineral resource estimates, which we conducted and found to be very favorable. This involved infilling approximately 600 to 700 drill holes across the expansive 15-kilometer ore body.
 So, we achieved indicated and measured resources through our extensive drilling, forming the foundation for reserve determinations, yielding excellent results. Concurrently, we focused on optimizing the leach kinetics of non-uranium minerals, as uranium recovery methods were already well-established. This effort showed promising outcomes, projecting an average recovery rate of at least 70% across all targeted metals, which will inform our revised DFS. The next critical component involves advanced resin technology, which we are currently developing. This innovation aims to sequentially extract uranium, critical minerals, and rare earths, enhancing the project's overall processing efficiency and value.
 The pilot study for the advanced resin technology is slated to commence in the next quarter, marking a crucial step forward. Simultaneously, we're conducting in-house DFS preparations, laying the groundwork for the project's comprehensive development strategy. Additionally, due to our shift towards more non-selective mining methods, we're carefully refining the mining schedule. This analysis will dictate equipment needs, beneficiation requirements, and operational logistics such as blending at the ROM pad or direct processing at the plant. These assessments are part of a rigorous study currently underway. As these components, two of which are already in progress, come together, we anticipate initiating the revised DFS later this year.
 We've already begun the process, and we anticipate releasing the revised DFS in the early second half of next year. This updated plan forecasts a significant extension in the project's lifespan, expanding from the initial 15 years to approximately 23 to 24 years. Importantly, this projection excludes the Mulga Rock West deposit, known as the Emperor deposit, which could potentially add another 10 years to the mine life. With environmental approvals already secured within our operational footprint, we're poised to proceed confidently. We're highly satisfied with our progress thus far and optimistic about the project's potential. We envision a robust, long-term mining operation that could commence production in late 2028.
 Thank you. Last and final question and it's more of a investors overview type question. We know the driver during the past uranium cycles has been the imbalance of supply and demand, which was exacerbated by the time and money it's required to bring new mines into production. But at the same time, there are a series of fundamental advancements in each particular uranium company. It plays an important role. And as an investor, we have to look at both, in the company and the industry. Based on your experience, would you comment on the interplay between that macro environment of the supply shortage of uranium production with the dynamics of uranium companies stages of development?
So, in broad strokes, we've witnessed a macroeconomic landscape where, beyond the initial uranium boom driven by military applications in the '40s and '50s, subsequent phases were shaped by shifts in energy needs. The oil shocks of the mid-20th century prompted a surge in nuclear power adoption for electricity generation, until the Chernobyl incident dampened enthusiasm. More recently, the early 2000s saw a resurgence driven notably by China's rapid economic growth, which reinvigorated global interest in nuclear power and uranium, largely propelled by China's demand.
 Since around September 2023, we've entered a new phase in the uranium sector, catalyzed by findings from the World Nuclear Association Symposium. Their marketing study, though outdated at the time, highlighted a fundamental uranium shortage amidst an industry that had seen minimal development for over a decade. This revelation sparked a boom, reshaping global energy strategies. Countries worldwide are now emphatically endorsing nuclear power, recognizing renewables as only one component of a broader energy strategy. This shift mirrors the top-down policy approaches seen during previous energy crises like the oil shocks, marking a significant departure from past dynamics.
Governments are endorsing nuclear power amid concerns over the risks and uncertainties associated with transitioning to renewable energy technologies, which have not been tested on an industrial scale before. This shift represents a significant departure from previous dynamics, where the focus was primarily on established nuclear reactor vendors like Westinghouse and GE, along with licensing agreements with reliable builders such as Korean firms. These firms have demonstrated their capability with successful projects in the Emirates, France, China, and Russia, achieving near-budget and on-time completion.
 And now, alongside these large units, there's a growing availability of small modular reactors (SMRs), which offer a tailored approach never before seen in the industry. These SMRs won't replace the larger reactors but provide new options. Looking ahead, there are also plans for micro reactors, anticipated to be operational in about six years, designed for industrial and corporate use at around 25 megawatts, with refueling capabilities. These developments will significantly increase demand for uranium. As existing inventories dwindle — currently around 30 million pounds alongside the annual production of 150 million pounds — projections indicate a need for 250 to 300 million pounds annually by the late 2030s to early 2040s.
So, for companies like Deep Yellow, including our own, strategic positioning is crucial. In the evolving uranium market, single-mine operations are less significant unless they feature a NextGen ore deposit with substantial scale and long-term viability. Diversification, both in terms of asset size and geographic spread, is now imperative for ensuring supply security. Deep Yellow has strategically built a pipeline of projects over the past seven years, a strategy that remains relevant today. As the industry faces a shortage of Greenfield projects and increasing demand for uranium, factors like a robust DFS and successful financing play critical roles in enhancing company value. We've observed how companies like Boss and Paladin have seen their values soar, and we aim to leverage our resources and reserves to capture similar value appreciation.
We're focused on achieving significant milestones that will not only reflect the rising tide of uranium prices but also distinguish us through meticulous preparation, our dedicated team, and a deep understanding of market dynamics. Our goal is to deliver substantial value to shareholders by strategically positioning Deep Yellow ahead of the curve in addressing the future supply needs of the uranium market. We recognize the imperative to differentiate ourselves from the existing landscape of uranium companies, ensuring we're not complacent but rather proactive and innovative in our approach. This forward-thinking strategy is essential as we navigate towards meeting the substantial future demand for uranium.
 Well, thank you John. And thanks for your time for participating in this CEO chat.
 It's a pleasure, Steven.

DYLLF: Deep Yellow Issues Annual Report – Review of Achievements of Past Fiscal Year & Expected Upcoming Milestones. Uranium industry update 2023-10-10T09:59:00.000Z

By 
OTCQX:DYLLF | ASX:DYL
(OTCQX:DYLLF) (ASX:DYL) 
: the company is being positioned to provide a leveraged opportunity to participate in all phases of the expected upswing in uranium prices. Management’s Dual Pillar strategy is designed to deliver both organic and inorganic growth by advancing the company’s Namibian and Australian projects through the production stage and by acquiring additional projects as the industry consolidates. 
, defined as a multi-project producer of uranium with the capacity to deliver 5-10 million lbs. of uranium annually.
CEO John Borshoff and his team previously achieved the same accomplishment with Paladin Energy Ltd by acquiring, developing and advancing the Langer Heinrich deposit into production within four years (2002-2006) and the Kayelekera Mine in Malawi (production 2009 to 2013) during the last uranium up cycle.
The Langer Heinrich uranium mine is situated 30km northeast of the Tumas Project. Deep Yellow’s executive team acquired, defined, funded, developed, optimized and operated Langer Heinrich from 2002 to 2017. The geology and type of deposit mineralization in these paleochannel systems at Langer Heinrich and Tumas are quite similar, and the mining jurisdiction is one in the same. Management is well-prepared to fast-track Tumas to production during this uranium up-cycle.
The company’s most advanced flagship project is the

Between March and August 2023, Deep Yellow conducted a 2-phase 340-hole (9,500m) 
west of Tumas 3 in order to expand the current resource base with a goal of increasing the LOM of the Tumas Project to over 30 years. A prospective 2.5km x 1.8km area west of Tumas 3. Was identified for infill drilling (hole spacing of 100m). We await the results of the drill program.

 due to population growth, the modernization of emerging & developing nations, the adoption of EVs and the growing desire to attain Net-Zero Carbon Emissions targets.

The uranium industry is composed of many companies, from major established producers to more speculative junior exploration companies. Though larger producers tend to have greater resources to navigate periods of depressed market conditions, junior companies provide greater leverage to the rise in uranium prices.
Almost all uranium stocks should benefit from the anticipated growth of much needed primary supply driven by the expected upcoming fundamental supply deficit; however, certain groups of uranium stocks benefit differently from each stage of the up-cycle. Historically (observing the 2001-2007 up-cycle), current producers reacted well to the 
 (since their current production could immediately benefit from the increase in the price of uranium), and they significantly outperformed the price of the commodity, itself. However, extreme out-sized returns were enjoyed by junior mining companies that traded below $0.25 per share at the bottom.
Then, there was a 
 when the rate of increase of the spot price of uranium moderated to a single-digit rate. In this period, junior mining companies corrected in the 40%-to-50% (sometimes multiple times), while producers corrected about half that amount (around 25%).
In the current uranium cycle, the advent of 
has aided the growing demand/supply imbalance by removing supply from the market. Their combined stockpiles now total over 100 million pounds. Currently, these uranium investment vehicles do not have formal redemption mechanisms. As uranium prices rise, there will be the potential for these funds to release supply into the market, triggering one of several expected 40%-to-50% corrections in the uranium space.
Broadly speaking, the public uranium companies can be grouped into three segments: producers, development companies and exploration companies. Producers are actively mining and generating revenues. Exploration companies are prospecting and/or drilling to establish mineral resources. In between these two segments are the development companies that already have established resources and are advancing through the process to bring a mine in operation, generally from the point of initiating a Pre-Feasibility Study to the actual construction of a mine. The comparable companies to Deep Yellow fall into this category.
Further, the comparable companies have been narrowed through quantitative factors, particularly those with a market capitalization over $350 million and trading above $0.75 per share. This process captures a range of well-funded junior uranium development companies, which are listed in the table above. Currently, the P/B valuation range of these comparable companies is between 3.58 and 8.68. With the expectation that Deep Yellow’s stock will attain a mid-second quartile P/B ratio of 6.3, our comparable analysis valuation price target is US$2.00.

Deep Yellow Limited's (ASX:DYL) top owners are retail investors with 60% stake, while 26% is held by institutions 2023-12-09T22:35:41.000Z

If you want to know who really controls Deep Yellow Limited (
), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 60% to be precise, is retail investors. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
Institutions, on the other hand, account for 26% of the company's stockholders. Institutions will often hold stock in bigger companies, and we expect to see insiders owning a noticeable percentage of the smaller ones.
Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Deep Yellow, beginning with the chart below.
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
Deep Yellow already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Deep Yellow's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.
Deep Yellow is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Paradice Investment Management Pty Ltd. with 8.0% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 6.9% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.3% by the third-largest shareholder. Additionally, the company's CEO John Borshoff directly holds 2.0% of the total shares outstanding.
On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.
While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in Deep Yellow Limited. As individuals, the insiders collectively own AU$66m worth of the AU$766m company. This shows at least some alignment. You can 
The general public -- including retail investors -- own 60% of Deep Yellow. With this amount of ownership, retail investors can collectively play a role in decisions that affect shareholder returns, such as dividend policies and the appointment of directors. They can also exercise the power to vote on acquisitions or mergers that may not improve profitability.
It seems that Private Companies own 5.3%, of the Deep Yellow stock. Private companies may be related parties. Sometimes insiders have an interest in a public company through a holding in a private company, rather than in their own capacity as an individual. While it's hard to draw any broad stroke conclusions, it is worth noting as an area for further research.
It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Deep Yellow better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified 
 that you should be aware of.

Will Deep Yellow (ASX:DYL) Spend Its Cash Wisely? 2024-02-05T01:03:30.000Z

There's no doubt that money can be made by owning shares of unprofitable businesses. For example, 
 (
) shareholders have done very well over the last year, with the share price soaring by 113%. But the harsh reality is that very many loss making companies burn through all their cash and go bankrupt.
Given its strong share price performance, we think it's worthwhile for Deep Yellow shareholders to consider whether its cash burn is concerning. In this report, we will consider the company's annual negative free cash flow, henceforth referring to it as the 'cash burn'. First, we'll determine its cash runway by comparing its cash burn with its cash reserves.
A company's cash runway is calculated by dividing its cash hoard by its cash burn. As at June 2023, Deep Yellow had cash of AU$41m and no debt. Looking at the last year, the company burnt through AU$33m. That means it had a cash runway of around 15 months as of June 2023. While that cash runway isn't too concerning, sensible holders would be peering into the distance, and considering what happens if the company runs out of cash. Depicted below, you can see how its cash holdings have changed over time.
Whilst it's great to see that Deep Yellow has already begun generating revenue from operations, last year it only produced AU$38k, so we don't think it is generating significant revenue, at this point. As a result, we think it's a bit early to focus on the revenue growth, so we'll limit ourselves to looking at how the cash burn is changing over time. In fact, it ramped its spending strongly over the last year, increasing cash burn by 176%. That sort of spending growth rate can't continue for very long before it causes balance sheet weakness, generally speaking. Clearly, however, the crucial factor is whether the company will grow its business going forward. For that reason, it makes a lot of sense to take a look at 
.
Given its cash burn trajectory, Deep Yellow shareholders may wish to consider how easily it could raise more cash, despite its solid cash runway. Companies can raise capital through either debt or equity. Commonly, a business will sell new shares in itself to raise cash and drive growth. By comparing a company's annual cash burn to its total market capitalisation, we can estimate roughly how many shares it would have to issue in order to run the company for another year (at the same burn rate).
Deep Yellow has a market capitalisation of AU$1.3b and burnt through AU$33m last year, which is 2.6% of the company's market value. That means it could easily issue a few shares to fund more growth, and might well be in a position to borrow cheaply.
On this analysis of Deep Yellow's cash burn, we think its cash burn relative to its market cap was reassuring, while its increasing cash burn has us a bit worried.

OTCQX:DYLLF | ASX:DYL
 management has positioned the company to provide a leveraged opportunity to participate in an expected upswing in uranium prices. Management’s Dual Pillar strategy is designed to deliver both organic and inorganic growth by advancing the company’s Namibian and Australian projects through the production stage and when attractive opportunities arise, by acquiring additional projects as the industry consolidates. 
 defined as a multi-project producer of uranium with the capacity to deliver 5-10 million lbs. of uranium annually.
In addition to advancements at the Tumas Project, along with the Mulga Rock and Alligator River Projects, during the first half of fiscal 2024 (see HALF YEAR INTERIM REPORT section below), the company benefitted from a

The net proceeds will be used:
1) to continue to advance the Tumas Project toward production
2) to allow for further development activities at the Mulga Rock Project, including a revised DFS
3) to fund other resource expansion activities through exploration at Alligator River & Omahola
4)to augment working capital
Deep Yellow is poised to enter a crucial stage in the company's lifecycle, specifically, 
, which will require financings or capital raises. This initial significant equity financing provides the necessary capital to move forward to the Final Investment Decision (FID) for the Tumas Project.
The AUD$250 million in capital was raised through a 
 (AUD$220 million) that was completed in two tranches (one in mid-March and the other in early-May), which in total consisted of the issuance of 
 at an issue price of AUD$1.225 per share. Additionally, 
 were issued to existing shareholders through a Share Purchase Plan, also at an issue price of AUD$1.225 per share. 
, requiring a pro-rata scale-back of the applications for shares.
Of note, during 2024, 
, most because of participation in the private placement. The entities were Macquarie Group Limited (March 13th), State Street Corporation (March 15th) MM Asset Management of Toronto (April 29th) and Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Limited (January 4th and March 25th).
Furthermore, through discussions with financiers, the company is progressing toward securing debt financing that will help fund construction costs of the Tumas uranium mine once the FID is made to proceed, which is expected to be announced near the end of the third calendar quarter of 2024. Typically, debt issued for mine construction is secured by the assets and/or future cash flows of the project.
In mid-April, Deep Yellow filed its

On February 29, 2024, an 
 commenced at Tumas 3 with the objectives to both upgrade and increase the Project’s MRE, while simultaneously bolstering the company’s financing effort to bring the Tumas mine to production. The goal is to define adequate Proven Reserves within the pit locations defined within the Tumas DFS for the mine to operate for initial six (6) years of operation.
, which should support the upgrading roughly 20 Mlbs U308 from the JORC Indicated to Measured category. 
 also commenced at the end of February, and as of the end of March, six (6) diamond drill holes (144m) and 189 RC holes (4,221m) had been completed. The entire drilling campaign is anticipated to be completed in June 2024.
 
Metallurgical test work for the Tumas Project continues. 
 has resulted in a material reduction in energy requirements, which is expected to reduce operating costs. 
, particularly by increasing the permeate yield and achieving a higher selectivity, which results in higher throughput of uranium, vanadium and reagents. These performance improvements should improve the Project’s NPV.
In December 2023, the Tumas Definitive Feasibility Study Re-Costing Study was completed, which updated the 
 U308 (a conservative increase considering the spot price has exceeded US$100/lb.) and adjusted the initial cost estimates to reflect the moderating rate of inflation and an abatement of the supply chain pressures. 
During the third fiscal quarter, the process of selecting an Engineering, Procurement, and Construction Management 
 commenced. The EPCM provider is expected to be selected during the fourth fiscal quarter. The detailed engineering phase should commence almost immediately thereafter and require about six (6) months to complete. It is anticipated that the Project will be further optimized when drilling results and subsequent re-estimation of reserves are received.

The decrease in the Inferred resource was a result of an overall upgrade of previously lower-grade material into the Indicated category. The updated MRE included drilling results from the 656-hole (36,647m) air core drill program completed in August 2023.
The 2018 DFS had uranium recovery rates in the 85.9%-to-89.6% range with no recovery assumed for critical minerals and only around 20% for base metals.
A revised DFS that will optimize the mining method, which will potentially include the recovery of critical minerals, is being undertaken with a completion date anticipated to be in the third calendar quarter of 2025.
Since the announcement of the 27% increase of the MRE for the Angularli Deposit at Alligator River Project in mid-2023, a heritage survey on EL5893 was conducted in the fourth calendar quarter of 2023, which resulted in conditional approval to explore areas north of Angularli. During the third fiscal quarter, desktop studies continue to delineate prospective corridors, including combining and merging radiometric, magnetic, and gravity data to produce geophysical images that will help identify prospective corridors. A drone-borne high-resolution magnetic and radiometric survey is being planned.

. Furthermore, at COP28 (28th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), which took place in Dubai between November 30 to December 12, 2023, 22 countries pledged to triple the nuclear capacity by 2050.
In 2023, the spot uranium price increased 90.9% from US$47.68/lb. to US$91.00/lb. On January 17, 2024, the spot uranium price spiked up to US$106.50/lb., a 17-year high. Meanwhile, Deep Yellow’s stock (OTCQX: DYLLF) rallied over 57.4% from $0.465 to $0.732 in 2023, and a further 53.0% to $1.12 thus far in 2024. The outlook for uranium market continues to be strong with demand exceeding supply for the foreseeable future.
Leading market research firms on the nuclear industry forecast that the deficit between primary supply (from mines) and the demand by nuclear reactors will continue to expand through 2040. In its reference scenario, the 
 calculates that the annual primary supply deficit for uranium will exceed 140 million pounds by 2030. Furthermore, in its Base case, UxC estimates that between 2023 and 2040, the needs of operating nuclear reactors will increase by 35%. Both scenarios indicate that new primary production will be needed with the price of uranium being the key determent that will incentivize the development of new mines.

Broadly speaking, the public uranium companies can be grouped into three segments: producers, development companies and exploration companies. Producers are actively mining and generating revenues. Exploration companies are prospecting and/or drilling to establish mineral resources. In between these two segments are the development companies that already have established resources and are advancing through the process to bring a mine in operation, generally from the point of initiating a Pre-Feasibility Study to the actual construction of a mine. The comparable companies to Deep Yellow fall into this category.
Further, the comparable companies have been narrowed through quantitative factors, particularly those with a market capitalization over $500 million and trading above $1.00 per share. This process captures a range of well-funded junior uranium development companies, which are listed in the table above. Currently, the P/B valuation range of these comparable companies is between 4.64 and 6.53. With the expectation that Deep Yellow’s stock will attain an industry average quartile P/B ratio of 5.9, our comparable analysis valuation price target is US$2.50.

With 54% institutional ownership, Deep Yellow Limited (ASX:DYL) is a favorite amongst the big guns 2024-06-04T23:56:12.000Z

A look at the shareholders of Deep Yellow Limited (
) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 54% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).
Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Deep Yellow.
Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.
Deep Yellow already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Deep Yellow's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Deep Yellow. Paradice Investment Management Pty Ltd. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 7.2% of shares outstanding. With 6.3% and 5.3% of the shares outstanding respectively, ALPS Advisors, Inc. and Mirae Asset Global Investments Co., Ltd. are the second and third largest shareholders. Furthermore, CEO John Borshoff is the owner of 1.8% of the company's shares.
After doing some more digging, we found that the top 12 have the combined ownership of 52% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
We can report that insiders do own shares in Deep Yellow Limited. It is a pretty big company, so it is generally a positive to see some potentially meaningful alignment. In this case, they own around AU$115m worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking 
The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 38% stake in Deep Yellow. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks for example - Deep Yellow has

Ausenco wins EPCM contract for Deep Yellow’s Namibia uranium mine 2024-06-05T10:46:37.000Z

Australia-based uranium developer Deep Yellow has selected Ausenco Services as the preferred contractor to manage the detailed engineering and EPCM services for its Tumas project in Namibia.
This development marks a significant step towards the establishment of the Tumas site as the fourth uranium mine in the country.
Ausenco is well-acquainted with the project having completed the definitive feasibility study in February 2023 and a re-costing addendum in December 2023.
Its extensive knowledge is expected to be a valuable asset in the project's progression.
The parties will reach a detailed engineering agreement to progress essential workstreams in anticipation of the FID.
The full EPCM contract will be finalised post-FID, laying the groundwork for the commencement of operations in 2026.
Deep Yellow expects the successful delivery of the Tumas project by Ausenco to not only mark the company's first mining operation but also to be a flagship development that will contribute significantly to Namibia's mining sector.
The company’s Tumas project has 132.9mlb of U308 in uranium deposits of the calcrete/palaeochannel type.
Tertiary and Quaternary fluvial sediments that occupy narrow, steep-sided palaeochannels host carnotite, the kind of uranium mineralisation seen in calcrete-type deposits and palaeochannels.
The host rocks range in texture from poorly consolidated and friable sands to strong, carbonate-cemented sandstones and conglomerates (calcrete).
Deep Yellow managing director and CEO John Borshoff said: “The selection of Ausenco as the preferred EPCM contractor for the Tumas project is a significant project milestone.
“Ausenco is a market-leading engineering firm, highly regarded within the industry for their technical ability and track record of project delivery.
“Having Ausenco on board will complement the project delivery team to add significant value to the exciting Tumas project, in a period of extended positive outlook in the uranium supply sector.”

Fireside Chat with John Borshoff, Managing Director and CEO of Deep Yellow Ltd. 2024-06-27T10:52:00.000Z

OTC:DYLLF
 Good day. This is Steven Ralston at Zacks Small Cap Research, and I'm here with John Borshoff, CEO of Deep Yellow. Hello, John. Thank you for giving us the time for the CEO chat.
Thanks, Steve. Pleasure to be here.
 In the time we have together, I'd like to discuss Deep Yellow's most advanced uranium projects, Tumas and Mulga Rock. First I'd like to address Tumas, which currently has a timetable for commencing production in late 2026. You have traveled this journey before, as you and your team advanced Paladin to production in the 2003-2007 timeframe, and in the same jurisdiction, very similar palaeochannel deposits. Obviously, you're well up the learning curve in addressing the stages of development for Tumas. Could you compare and contrast the path here at Tumas with your experience at Paladin?
 Yes, Steven, I will do that. Before I do this, though, I just want to just give a little bit of background in terms of the how I've positioned Deep Yellow and the similarities of that to what I did in Paladin. In Paladin when I started to do a contrarian approach and developing a project pipeline at a time when uranium wasn't looking hot at all. By that time, before the China phenomenon happened, I had two projects in the pipeline. Greenfield was ready for development in Langer Heinrich and Kayelekera. This type of forward planning, where we didn't anticipate the exact timing of China's involvement, just galvanized our positioning.
 We became an investment phenomena. This was a result of that positioning which nobody else in the sector had done. So, come forward now 15 years and look at where Deep Yellow is. Remarkably, we are in a similar position this time. I took a contrarian approach because I really believe the opportunity lay in the fact that the sector is suffering from a shortage of uranium mine builders. And it's due to many reasons, where expertise disappeared and basically most companies and their projects went on standstill. So in getting Deep Yellow to where it is today, what we have got is two Greenfield projects ready for development over the next three to four years in Tumas and Mulga Rock.
 But in parallel with that, one of the biggest parts of asset development has been bringing the core team from Paladin, which was the only company to develop conventional uranium mines over the previous 25 years. And so the asset was Deep Yellow, which is the team we're familiar with. It's not just geological. It's not just developmental or operational. It's governance, financing, and all of the key attributes needed for uranium mining are within Deep Yellow. That's the number one achievement we have accomplished quietly, with purpose and vision. When you look at the world today, there is a serious lack of Greenfield projects ready for development with teams that can demonstrably develop and have credibility. That's point number one.
 So, one experience that I had and introduced into Deep Yellow, which I had successfully applied with Paladin, is our current approach. We aimed to marry, merge, and get a very thorough DFS out by February 2023. Then, having the fortitude and vision, we decided to re-cost that six months later, which proved to be a very good move. The reason for the re-costing was that the February 2023 DFS faced headwinds from inflation and supply chain issues. Even though about 75% of the DFS was based on tenders rather than just factoring, these headwinds added extra costs. We included them in the DFS because our purpose was not just to create a showpiece for shareholders, but to present something we knew we had to honor and develop. Our goal is to become a major producer in the sector.
 To eliminate any doubt about the DFS, we spent a considerable amount of money in conjunction with the project engineer and our team, which provides all the process IPs and everything. We re-examined the CapEx and OpEx, and re-costed them as an addendum to the DFS, signed off by the project engineer, making it fully auditable. As a result, we reduced the CapEx by about $20 million USD. The OpEx came in slightly higher, but it wasn't significant enough to change things overall. This higher OpEx absorbed a 12% increase in fuel costs and a 10% increase in power costs.
 So in fact, our old DFS had the OpEx about right, which helped eliminate concerns or doubts that a financier might have. They might have looked at it and thought, 'Oh, this is what they were talking about.' This caution likely comes from our experience with Langer. We now better understand how financiers think. These financiers have been involved with us previously, so we have a track record of honoring our commitments. We've placed a bigger emphasis on tendering the EPCM contract, ensuring we get the best out of it. We need an EPCM contractor capable of delivering on schedule, on price, and on cost, aiming for production in 2026.
 So, we've invested a lot of effort into this. We've selected our detailed engineer who will handle the engineering and EPCM. This has been announced, and now we're focusing on what they call the SP1 component, which involves feed or detailed engineering, and the SP2 component, which is the actual construction execution. We are currently enhancing the organic structure of our management approach from our side, ensuring alignment between what the engineer perceives and what we understand on our end. This prevents surprises like suddenly discovering midway through that there's an additional $50 million in costs due to discrepancies between on-site activities and documentation.
Our efforts in advancing our financing have been substantial. We've integrated key personnel from Paladin into our group, and we're on the verge of announcing a mandate with a bank, which is progressing smoothly. One critical aspect we're examining is the optimal leverage against the cost of equity. Preserving the upside potential of our contracts and offtake agreements is paramount to ensure maximum shareholder benefit. We now have a more refined owners team in place, focusing on co-managing the design approval process and integrating operational experts who will remain integral to the project's ongoing success. I hope that clarifies things for you.
Yes. And thank you for those insights on the Tumas project. We could now move to the Mulga Rock project. Earlier this year Deep Yellow released updated MRE on two deposits that are at Mulga Rock. And for the first time, it included estimates of critical minerals, namely copper, nickel, cobalt, zinc, and rare earths. It increased the estimate by 85%. I understand we should expect and revise DFS that will optimize the mining methods for the recovery of these critical minerals. What else is being planned to contribute to this revised DFS, which we expect in a little over a year from now?
 Right. During our due diligence on Vimy, the previous owners of Mulga Rock, we identified potential upside that we felt was not fully captured in their 2018 DFS, which serves as the core technical document. There was also a subsequent promotional refresh of the DFS that lacked authoritative backing. The landscape for uranium has evolved significantly from the post-Fukushima era of 2010-2011 through 2018 to 2022-2023. The parameters on which Vimy's DFS was based no longer aligned with the current realities. For instance, critical and battery minerals, as well as rare earths, were not major considerations back then.
 So, Vimy focused primarily on addressing environmental concerns and extracting easily leachable base metals, which they intended to explore further in their subsequent bankable feasibility study. Our analysis revealed significant upside potential, both in interpreting the ore body and in how Vimy's extensive drilling and test work could be leveraged. While their integrity in data collection was not in question, we identified additional potential in uranium. It's worth noting that the project remains fundamentally a standalone uranium venture, a perspective we continue to uphold.
 And so, following the merger, we explored value addition through critical minerals and rare earths, revealing significant upside potential. Our preliminary assessments confirmed this, suggesting a transformative impact on the project's longevity and value. Since August 2022, and ongoing, four key components are shaping our revised DFS. Firstly, the mineral resource estimates, which we conducted and found to be very favorable. This involved infilling approximately 600 to 700 drill holes across the expansive 15-kilometer ore body.
 So, we achieved indicated and measured resources through our extensive drilling, forming the foundation for reserve determinations, yielding excellent results. Concurrently, we focused on optimizing the leach kinetics of non-uranium minerals, as uranium recovery methods were already well-established. This effort showed promising outcomes, projecting an average recovery rate of at least 70% across all targeted metals, which will inform our revised DFS. The next critical component involves advanced resin technology, which we are currently developing. This innovation aims to sequentially extract uranium, critical minerals, and rare earths, enhancing the project's overall processing efficiency and value.
 The pilot study for the advanced resin technology is slated to commence in the next quarter, marking a crucial step forward. Simultaneously, we're conducting in-house DFS preparations, laying the groundwork for the project's comprehensive development strategy. Additionally, due to our shift towards more non-selective mining methods, we're carefully refining the mining schedule. This analysis will dictate equipment needs, beneficiation requirements, and operational logistics such as blending at the ROM pad or direct processing at the plant. These assessments are part of a rigorous study currently underway. As these components, two of which are already in progress, come together, we anticipate initiating the revised DFS later this year.
 We've already begun the process, and we anticipate releasing the revised DFS in the early second half of next year. This updated plan forecasts a significant extension in the project's lifespan, expanding from the initial 15 years to approximately 23 to 24 years. Importantly, this projection excludes the Mulga Rock West deposit, known as the Emperor deposit, which could potentially add another 10 years to the mine life. With environmental approvals already secured within our operational footprint, we're poised to proceed confidently. We're highly satisfied with our progress thus far and optimistic about the project's potential. We envision a robust, long-term mining operation that could commence production in late 2028.
 Thank you. Last and final question and it's more of a investors overview type question. We know the driver during the past uranium cycles has been the imbalance of supply and demand, which was exacerbated by the time and money it's required to bring new mines into production. But at the same time, there are a series of fundamental advancements in each particular uranium company. It plays an important role. And as an investor, we have to look at both, in the company and the industry. Based on your experience, would you comment on the interplay between that macro environment of the supply shortage of uranium production with the dynamics of uranium companies stages of development?
So, in broad strokes, we've witnessed a macroeconomic landscape where, beyond the initial uranium boom driven by military applications in the '40s and '50s, subsequent phases were shaped by shifts in energy needs. The oil shocks of the mid-20th century prompted a surge in nuclear power adoption for electricity generation, until the Chernobyl incident dampened enthusiasm. More recently, the early 2000s saw a resurgence driven notably by China's rapid economic growth, which reinvigorated global interest in nuclear power and uranium, largely propelled by China's demand.
 Since around September 2023, we've entered a new phase in the uranium sector, catalyzed by findings from the World Nuclear Association Symposium. Their marketing study, though outdated at the time, highlighted a fundamental uranium shortage amidst an industry that had seen minimal development for over a decade. This revelation sparked a boom, reshaping global energy strategies. Countries worldwide are now emphatically endorsing nuclear power, recognizing renewables as only one component of a broader energy strategy. This shift mirrors the top-down policy approaches seen during previous energy crises like the oil shocks, marking a significant departure from past dynamics.
Governments are endorsing nuclear power amid concerns over the risks and uncertainties associated with transitioning to renewable energy technologies, which have not been tested on an industrial scale before. This shift represents a significant departure from previous dynamics, where the focus was primarily on established nuclear reactor vendors like Westinghouse and GE, along with licensing agreements with reliable builders such as Korean firms. These firms have demonstrated their capability with successful projects in the Emirates, France, China, and Russia, achieving near-budget and on-time completion.
 And now, alongside these large units, there's a growing availability of small modular reactors (SMRs), which offer a tailored approach never before seen in the industry. These SMRs won't replace the larger reactors but provide new options. Looking ahead, there are also plans for micro reactors, anticipated to be operational in about six years, designed for industrial and corporate use at around 25 megawatts, with refueling capabilities. These developments will significantly increase demand for uranium. As existing inventories dwindle — currently around 30 million pounds alongside the annual production of 150 million pounds — projections indicate a need for 250 to 300 million pounds annually by the late 2030s to early 2040s.
So, for companies like Deep Yellow, including our own, strategic positioning is crucial. In the evolving uranium market, single-mine operations are less significant unless they feature a NextGen ore deposit with substantial scale and long-term viability. Diversification, both in terms of asset size and geographic spread, is now imperative for ensuring supply security. Deep Yellow has strategically built a pipeline of projects over the past seven years, a strategy that remains relevant today. As the industry faces a shortage of Greenfield projects and increasing demand for uranium, factors like a robust DFS and successful financing play critical roles in enhancing company value. We've observed how companies like Boss and Paladin have seen their values soar, and we aim to leverage our resources and reserves to capture similar value appreciation.
We're focused on achieving significant milestones that will not only reflect the rising tide of uranium prices but also distinguish us through meticulous preparation, our dedicated team, and a deep understanding of market dynamics. Our goal is to deliver substantial value to shareholders by strategically positioning Deep Yellow ahead of the curve in addressing the future supply needs of the uranium market. We recognize the imperative to differentiate ourselves from the existing landscape of uranium companies, ensuring we're not complacent but rather proactive and innovative in our approach. This forward-thinking strategy is essential as we navigate towards meeting the substantial future demand for uranium.
 Well, thank you John. And thanks for your time for participating in this CEO chat.
 It's a pleasure, Steven.

The uranium industry is composed of many companies, from major established producers to more speculative junior exploration companies. Though larger producers tend to have greater resources to navigate periods of depressed market conditions, junior companies provide greater leverage to the rise in uranium prices.
Almost all uranium stocks should benefit from the anticipated growth of much needed primary supply driven by the expected upcoming fundamental supply deficit; however, certain groups of uranium stocks benefit differently from each stage of the up-cycle. Historically (observing the 2001-2007 up-cycle), current producers reacted well to the 
 (since their current production could immediately benefit from the increase in the price of uranium), and they significantly outperformed the price of the commodity, itself. However, extreme out-sized returns were enjoyed by junior mining companies that traded below $0.25 per share at the bottom.
Then, there was a 
 when the rate of increase of the spot price of uranium moderated to a single-digit rate. In this period, junior mining companies corrected in the 40%-to-50% (sometimes multiple times), while producers corrected about half that amount (around 25%).
In the current uranium cycle, the advent of 
has aided the growing demand/supply imbalance by removing supply from the market. Their combined stockpiles now total over 100 million pounds. Currently, these uranium investment vehicles do not have formal redemption mechanisms. As uranium prices rise, there will be the potential for these funds to release supply into the market, triggering one of several expected 40%-to-50% corrections in the uranium space.
Broadly speaking, the public uranium companies can be grouped into three segments: producers, development companies and exploration companies. Producers are actively mining and generating revenues. Exploration companies are prospecting and/or drilling to establish mineral resources. In between these two segments are the development companies that already have established resources and are advancing through the process to bring a mine in operation, generally from the point of initiating a Pre-Feasibility Study to the actual construction of a mine. The comparable companies to Deep Yellow fall into this category.
Further, the comparable companies have been narrowed through quantitative factors, particularly those with a market capitalization over $350 million and trading above $0.75 per share. This process captures a range of well-funded junior uranium development companies, which are listed in the table above. Currently, the P/B valuation range of these comparable companies is between 3.58 and 8.68. With the expectation that Deep Yellow’s stock will attain a mid-second quartile P/B ratio of 6.3, our comparable analysis valuation price target is US$2.00.

Deep Yellow Limited's (ASX:DYL) top owners are retail investors with 60% stake, while 26% is held by institutions 2023-12-09T22:35:41.000Z

If you want to know who really controls Deep Yellow Limited (
), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 60% to be precise, is retail investors. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
Institutions, on the other hand, account for 26% of the company's stockholders. Institutions will often hold stock in bigger companies, and we expect to see insiders owning a noticeable percentage of the smaller ones.
Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Deep Yellow, beginning with the chart below.
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
Deep Yellow already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Deep Yellow's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.
Deep Yellow is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Paradice Investment Management Pty Ltd. with 8.0% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 6.9% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.3% by the third-largest shareholder. Additionally, the company's CEO John Borshoff directly holds 2.0% of the total shares outstanding.
On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.
While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in Deep Yellow Limited. As individuals, the insiders collectively own AU$66m worth of the AU$766m company. This shows at least some alignment. You can 
The general public -- including retail investors -- own 60% of Deep Yellow. With this amount of ownership, retail investors can collectively play a role in decisions that affect shareholder returns, such as dividend policies and the appointment of directors. They can also exercise the power to vote on acquisitions or mergers that may not improve profitability.
It seems that Private Companies own 5.3%, of the Deep Yellow stock. Private companies may be related parties. Sometimes insiders have an interest in a public company through a holding in a private company, rather than in their own capacity as an individual. While it's hard to draw any broad stroke conclusions, it is worth noting as an area for further research.
It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Deep Yellow better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified 
 that you should be aware of.

Will Deep Yellow (ASX:DYL) Spend Its Cash Wisely? 2024-02-05T01:03:30.000Z

There's no doubt that money can be made by owning shares of unprofitable businesses. For example, 
 (
) shareholders have done very well over the last year, with the share price soaring by 113%. But the harsh reality is that very many loss making companies burn through all their cash and go bankrupt.
Given its strong share price performance, we think it's worthwhile for Deep Yellow shareholders to consider whether its cash burn is concerning. In this report, we will consider the company's annual negative free cash flow, henceforth referring to it as the 'cash burn'. First, we'll determine its cash runway by comparing its cash burn with its cash reserves.
A company's cash runway is calculated by dividing its cash hoard by its cash burn. As at June 2023, Deep Yellow had cash of AU$41m and no debt. Looking at the last year, the company burnt through AU$33m. That means it had a cash runway of around 15 months as of June 2023. While that cash runway isn't too concerning, sensible holders would be peering into the distance, and considering what happens if the company runs out of cash. Depicted below, you can see how its cash holdings have changed over time.
Whilst it's great to see that Deep Yellow has already begun generating revenue from operations, last year it only produced AU$38k, so we don't think it is generating significant revenue, at this point. As a result, we think it's a bit early to focus on the revenue growth, so we'll limit ourselves to looking at how the cash burn is changing over time. In fact, it ramped its spending strongly over the last year, increasing cash burn by 176%. That sort of spending growth rate can't continue for very long before it causes balance sheet weakness, generally speaking. Clearly, however, the crucial factor is whether the company will grow its business going forward. For that reason, it makes a lot of sense to take a look at 
.
Given its cash burn trajectory, Deep Yellow shareholders may wish to consider how easily it could raise more cash, despite its solid cash runway. Companies can raise capital through either debt or equity. Commonly, a business will sell new shares in itself to raise cash and drive growth. By comparing a company's annual cash burn to its total market capitalisation, we can estimate roughly how many shares it would have to issue in order to run the company for another year (at the same burn rate).
Deep Yellow has a market capitalisation of AU$1.3b and burnt through AU$33m last year, which is 2.6% of the company's market value. That means it could easily issue a few shares to fund more growth, and might well be in a position to borrow cheaply.
On this analysis of Deep Yellow's cash burn, we think its cash burn relative to its market cap was reassuring, while its increasing cash burn has us a bit worried. Cash burning companies are always on the riskier side of things, but after considering all of the factors discussed in this short piece, we're not too worried about its rate of cash burn. On another note, Deep Yellow has

Deep Yellow is poised to enter a crucial stage in the company's lifecycle, specifically, 
, which will require financings or capital raises. This initial significant equity financing provides the necessary capital to move forward to the Final Investment Decision (FID) for the Tumas Project.
The AUD$250 million in capital was raised through a

Furthermore, through discussions with financiers, the company is progressing toward securing debt financing that will help fund construction costs of the Tumas uranium mine once the FID is made to proceed, which is expected to be announced near the end of the third calendar quarter of 2024. Typically, debt issued for mine construction is secured by the assets and/or future cash flows of the project.

 also commenced at the end of February, and as of the end of March, six (6) diamond drill holes (144m) and 189 RC holes (4,221m) had been completed. The entire drilling campaign is anticipated to be completed in June 2024.
 
Metallurgical test work for the Tumas Project continues. 
 has resulted in a material reduction in energy requirements, which is expected to reduce operating costs. 
, particularly by increasing the permeate yield and achieving a higher selectivity, which results in higher throughput of uranium, vanadium and reagents. These performance improvements should improve the Project’s NPV.
In December 2023, the Tumas Definitive Feasibility Study Re-Costing Study was completed, which updated the 
 U308 (a conservative increase considering the spot price has exceeded US$100/lb.) and adjusted the initial cost estimates to reflect the moderating rate of inflation and an abatement of the supply chain pressures. 
During the third fiscal quarter, the process of selecting an Engineering, Procurement, and Construction Management

The decrease in the Inferred resource was a result of an overall upgrade of previously lower-grade material into the Indicated category. The updated MRE included drilling results from the 656-hole (36,647m) air core drill program completed in August 2023.
The 2018 DFS had uranium recovery rates in the 85.9%-to-89.6% range with no recovery assumed for critical minerals and only around 20% for base metals.
A revised DFS that will optimize the mining method, which will potentially include the recovery of critical minerals, is being undertaken with a completion date anticipated to be in the third calendar quarter of 2025.
Since the announcement of the 27% increase of the MRE for the Angularli Deposit at Alligator River Project in mid-2023, a heritage survey on EL5893 was conducted in the fourth calendar quarter of 2023, which resulted in conditional approval to explore areas north of Angularli. During the third fiscal quarter, desktop studies continue to delineate prospective corridors, including combining and merging radiometric, magnetic, and gravity data to produce geophysical images that will help identify prospective corridors.

Broadly speaking, the public uranium companies can be grouped into three segments: producers, development companies and exploration companies. Producers are actively mining and generating revenues. Exploration companies are prospecting and/or drilling to establish mineral resources. In between these two segments are the development companies that already have established resources and are advancing through the process to bring a mine in operation, generally from the point of initiating a Pre-Feasibility Study to the actual construction of a mine. The comparable companies to Deep Yellow fall into this category.
Further, the comparable companies have been narrowed through quantitative factors, particularly those with a market capitalization over $500 million and trading above $1.00 per share. This process captures a range of well-funded junior uranium development companies, which are listed in the table above. Currently, the P/B valuation range of these comparable companies is between 4.64 and 6.53. With the expectation that Deep Yellow’s stock will attain an industry average quartile P/B ratio of 5.9, our comparable analysis valuation price target is US$2.50.

With 54% institutional ownership, Deep Yellow Limited (ASX:DYL) is a favorite amongst the big guns 2024-06-04T23:56:12.000Z

A look at the shareholders of Deep Yellow Limited (
) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 54% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).
Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Deep Yellow.
Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.
Deep Yellow already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Deep Yellow's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Deep Yellow. Paradice Investment Management Pty Ltd. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 7.2% of shares outstanding. With 6.3% and 5.3% of the shares outstanding respectively, ALPS Advisors, Inc. and Mirae Asset Global Investments Co., Ltd. are the second and third largest shareholders. Furthermore, CEO John Borshoff is the owner of 1.8% of the company's shares.
After doing some more digging, we found that the top 12 have the combined ownership of 52% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
We can report that insiders do own shares in Deep Yellow Limited. It is a pretty big company, so it is generally a positive to see some potentially meaningful alignment. In this case, they own around AU$115m worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking 
The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 38% stake in Deep Yellow. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks for example - Deep Yellow has

Ausenco wins EPCM contract for Deep Yellow’s Namibia uranium mine 2024-06-05T10:46:37.000Z

Australia-based uranium developer Deep Yellow has selected Ausenco Services as the preferred contractor to manage the detailed engineering and EPCM services for its Tumas project in Namibia.
This development marks a significant step towards the establishment of the Tumas site as the fourth uranium mine in the country.
Ausenco is well-acquainted with the project having completed the definitive feasibility study in February 2023 and a re-costing addendum in December 2023.
Its extensive knowledge is expected to be a valuable asset in the project's progression.
The parties will reach a detailed engineering agreement to progress essential workstreams in anticipation of the FID.
The full EPCM contract will be finalised post-FID, laying the groundwork for the commencement of operations in 2026.
Deep Yellow expects the successful delivery of the Tumas project by Ausenco to not only mark the company's first mining operation but also to be a flagship development that will contribute significantly to Namibia's mining sector.
The company’s Tumas project has 132.9mlb of U308 in uranium deposits of the calcrete/palaeochannel type.
Tertiary and Quaternary fluvial sediments that occupy narrow, steep-sided palaeochannels host carnotite, the kind of uranium mineralisation seen in calcrete-type deposits and palaeochannels.
The host rocks range in texture from poorly consolidated and friable sands to strong, carbonate-cemented sandstones and conglomerates (calcrete).
Deep Yellow managing director and CEO John Borshoff said: “The selection of Ausenco as the preferred EPCM contractor for the Tumas project is a significant project milestone.
“Ausenco is a market-leading engineering firm, highly regarded within the industry for their technical ability and track record of project delivery.
“Having Ausenco on board will complement the project delivery team to add significant value to the exciting Tumas project, in a period of extended positive outlook in the uranium supply sector.”

Fireside Chat with John Borshoff, Managing Director and CEO of Deep Yellow Ltd. 2024-06-27T10:52:00.000Z

OTC:DYLLF
 Good day. This is Steven Ralston at Zacks Small Cap Research, and I'm here with John Borshoff, CEO of Deep Yellow. Hello, John. Thank you for giving us the time for the CEO chat.
Thanks, Steve. Pleasure to be here.
 In the time we have together, I'd like to discuss Deep Yellow's most advanced uranium projects, Tumas and Mulga Rock. First I'd like to address Tumas, which currently has a timetable for commencing production in late 2026. You have traveled this journey before, as you and your team advanced Paladin to production in the 2003-2007 timeframe, and in the same jurisdiction, very similar palaeochannel deposits. Obviously, you're well up the learning curve in addressing the stages of development for Tumas. Could you compare and contrast the path here at Tumas with your experience at Paladin?
 Yes, Steven, I will do that. Before I do this, though, I just want to just give a little bit of background in terms of the how I've positioned Deep Yellow and the similarities of that to what I did in Paladin. In Paladin when I started to do a contrarian approach and developing a project pipeline at a time when uranium wasn't looking hot at all. By that time, before the China phenomenon happened, I had two projects in the pipeline. Greenfield was ready for development in Langer Heinrich and Kayelekera. This type of forward planning, where we didn't anticipate the exact timing of China's involvement, just galvanized our positioning.
 We became an investment phenomena. This was a result of that positioning which nobody else in the sector had done. So, come forward now 15 years and look at where Deep Yellow is. Remarkably, we are in a similar position this time. I took a contrarian approach because I really believe the opportunity lay in the fact that the sector is suffering from a shortage of uranium mine builders. And it's due to many reasons, where expertise disappeared and basically most companies and their projects went on standstill. So in getting Deep Yellow to where it is today, what we have got is two Greenfield projects ready for development over the next three to four years in Tumas and Mulga Rock.
 But in parallel with that, one of the biggest parts of asset development has been bringing the core team from Paladin, which was the only company to develop conventional uranium mines over the previous 25 years. And so the asset was Deep Yellow, which is the team we're familiar with. It's not just geological. It's not just developmental or operational. It's governance, financing, and all of the key attributes needed for uranium mining are within Deep Yellow. That's the number one achievement we have accomplished quietly, with purpose and vision. When you look at the world today, there is a serious lack of Greenfield projects ready for development with teams that can demonstrably develop and have credibility. That's point number one.
 So, one experience that I had and introduced into Deep Yellow, which I had successfully applied with Paladin, is our current approach. We aimed to marry, merge, and get a very thorough DFS out by February 2023. Then, having the fortitude and vision, we decided to re-cost that six months later, which proved to be a very good move. The reason for the re-costing was that the February 2023 DFS faced headwinds from inflation and supply chain issues. Even though about 75% of the DFS was based on tenders rather than just factoring, these headwinds added extra costs. We included them in the DFS because our purpose was not just to create a showpiece for shareholders, but to present something we knew we had to honor and develop. Our goal is to become a major producer in the sector.
 To eliminate any doubt about the DFS, we spent a considerable amount of money in conjunction with the project engineer and our team, which provides all the process IPs and everything. We re-examined the CapEx and OpEx, and re-costed them as an addendum to the DFS, signed off by the project engineer, making it fully auditable. As a result, we reduced the CapEx by about $20 million USD. The OpEx came in slightly higher, but it wasn't significant enough to change things overall. This higher OpEx absorbed a 12% increase in fuel costs and a 10% increase in power costs.
 So in fact, our old DFS had the OpEx about right, which helped eliminate concerns or doubts that a financier might have. They might have looked at it and thought, 'Oh, this is what they were talking about.' This caution likely comes from our experience with Langer. We now better understand how financiers think. These financiers have been involved with us previously, so we have a track record of honoring our commitments. We've placed a bigger emphasis on tendering the EPCM contract, ensuring we get the best out of it. We need an EPCM contractor capable of delivering on schedule, on price, and on cost, aiming for production in 2026.
 So, we've invested a lot of effort into this. We've selected our detailed engineer who will handle the engineering and EPCM. This has been announced, and now we're focusing on what they call the SP1 component, which involves feed or detailed engineering, and the SP2 component, which is the actual construction execution. We are currently enhancing the organic structure of our management approach from our side, ensuring alignment between what the engineer perceives and what we understand on our end. This prevents surprises like suddenly discovering midway through that there's an additional $50 million in costs due to discrepancies between on-site activities and documentation.
Our efforts in advancing our financing have been substantial. We've integrated key personnel from Paladin into our group, and we're on the verge of announcing a mandate with a bank, which is progressing smoothly. One critical aspect we're examining is the optimal leverage against the cost of equity. Preserving the upside potential of our contracts and offtake agreements is paramount to ensure maximum shareholder benefit. We now have a more refined owners team in place, focusing on co-managing the design approval process and integrating operational experts who will remain integral to the project's ongoing success. I hope that clarifies things for you.
Yes. And thank you for those insights on the Tumas project. We could now move to the Mulga Rock project. Earlier this year Deep Yellow released updated MRE on two deposits that are at Mulga Rock. And for the first time, it included estimates of critical minerals, namely copper, nickel, cobalt, zinc, and rare earths. It increased the estimate by 85%. I understand we should expect and revise DFS that will optimize the mining methods for the recovery of these critical minerals. What else is being planned to contribute to this revised DFS, which we expect in a little over a year from now?
 Right. During our due diligence on Vimy, the previous owners of Mulga Rock, we identified potential upside that we felt was not fully captured in their 2018 DFS, which serves as the core technical document. There was also a subsequent promotional refresh of the DFS that lacked authoritative backing. The landscape for uranium has evolved significantly from the post-Fukushima era of 2010-2011 through 2018 to 2022-2023. The parameters on which Vimy's DFS was based no longer aligned with the current realities. For instance, critical and battery minerals, as well as rare earths, were not major considerations back then.
 So, Vimy focused primarily on addressing environmental concerns and extracting easily leachable base metals, which they intended to explore further in their subsequent bankable feasibility study. Our analysis revealed significant upside potential, both in interpreting the ore body and in how Vimy's extensive drilling and test work could be leveraged. While their integrity in data collection was not in question, we identified additional potential in uranium. It's worth noting that the project remains fundamentally a standalone uranium venture, a perspective we continue to uphold.
 And so, following the merger, we explored value addition through critical minerals and rare earths, revealing significant upside potential. Our preliminary assessments confirmed this, suggesting a transformative impact on the project's longevity and value. Since August 2022, and ongoing, four key components are shaping our revised DFS. Firstly, the mineral resource estimates, which we conducted and found to be very favorable. This involved infilling approximately 600 to 700 drill holes across the expansive 15-kilometer ore body.
 So, we achieved indicated and measured resources through our extensive drilling, forming the foundation for reserve determinations, yielding excellent results. Concurrently, we focused on optimizing the leach kinetics of non-uranium minerals, as uranium recovery methods were already well-established. This effort showed promising outcomes, projecting an average recovery rate of at least 70% across all targeted metals, which will inform our revised DFS. The next critical component involves advanced resin technology, which we are currently developing. This innovation aims to sequentially extract uranium, critical minerals, and rare earths, enhancing the project's overall processing efficiency and value.
 The pilot study for the advanced resin technology is slated to commence in the next quarter, marking a crucial step forward. Simultaneously, we're conducting in-house DFS preparations, laying the groundwork for the project's comprehensive development strategy. Additionally, due to our shift towards more non-selective mining methods, we're carefully refining the mining schedule. This analysis will dictate equipment needs, beneficiation requirements, and operational logistics such as blending at the ROM pad or direct processing at the plant. These assessments are part of a rigorous study currently underway. As these components, two of which are already in progress, come together, we anticipate initiating the revised DFS later this year.
 We've already begun the process, and we anticipate releasing the revised DFS in the early second half of next year. This updated plan forecasts a significant extension in the project's lifespan, expanding from the initial 15 years to approximately 23 to 24 years. Importantly, this projection excludes the Mulga Rock West deposit, known as the Emperor deposit, which could potentially add another 10 years to the mine life. With environmental approvals already secured within our operational footprint, we're poised to proceed confidently. We're highly satisfied with our progress thus far and optimistic about the project's potential. We envision a robust, long-term mining operation that could commence production in late 2028.
 Thank you. Last and final question and it's more of a investors overview type question. We know the driver during the past uranium cycles has been the imbalance of supply and demand, which was exacerbated by the time and money it's required to bring new mines into production. But at the same time, there are a series of fundamental advancements in each particular uranium company. It plays an important role. And as an investor, we have to look at both, in the company and the industry. Based on your experience, would you comment on the interplay between that macro environment of the supply shortage of uranium production with the dynamics of uranium companies stages of development?
So, in broad strokes, we've witnessed a macroeconomic landscape where, beyond the initial uranium boom driven by military applications in the '40s and '50s, subsequent phases were shaped by shifts in energy needs. The oil shocks of the mid-20th century prompted a surge in nuclear power adoption for electricity generation, until the Chernobyl incident dampened enthusiasm. More recently, the early 2000s saw a resurgence driven notably by China's rapid economic growth, which reinvigorated global interest in nuclear power and uranium, largely propelled by China's demand.
 Since around September 2023, we've entered a new phase in the uranium sector, catalyzed by findings from the World Nuclear Association Symposium. Their marketing study, though outdated at the time, highlighted a fundamental uranium shortage amidst an industry that had seen minimal development for over a decade. This revelation sparked a boom, reshaping global energy strategies. Countries worldwide are now emphatically endorsing nuclear power, recognizing renewables as only one component of a broader energy strategy. This shift mirrors the top-down policy approaches seen during previous energy crises like the oil shocks, marking a significant departure from past dynamics.
Governments are endorsing nuclear power amid concerns over the risks and uncertainties associated with transitioning to renewable energy technologies, which have not been tested on an industrial scale before. This shift represents a significant departure from previous dynamics, where the focus was primarily on established nuclear reactor vendors like Westinghouse and GE, along with licensing agreements with reliable builders such as Korean firms. These firms have demonstrated their capability with successful projects in the Emirates, France, China, and Russia, achieving near-budget and on-time completion.
 And now, alongside these large units, there's a growing availability of small modular reactors (SMRs), which offer a tailored approach never before seen in the industry. These SMRs won't replace the larger reactors but provide new options. Looking ahead, there are also plans for micro reactors, anticipated to be operational in about six years, designed for industrial and corporate use at around 25 megawatts, with refueling capabilities. These developments will significantly increase demand for uranium. As existing inventories dwindle — currently around 30 million pounds alongside the annual production of 150 million pounds — projections indicate a need for 250 to 300 million pounds annually by the late 2030s to early 2040s.
So, for companies like Deep Yellow, including our own, strategic positioning is crucial. In the evolving uranium market, single-mine operations are less significant unless they feature a NextGen ore deposit with substantial scale and long-term viability. Diversification, both in terms of asset size and geographic spread, is now imperative for ensuring supply security. Deep Yellow has strategically built a pipeline of projects over the past seven years, a strategy that remains relevant today. As the industry faces a shortage of Greenfield projects and increasing demand for uranium, factors like a robust DFS and successful financing play critical roles in enhancing company value. We've observed how companies like Boss and Paladin have seen their values soar, and we aim to leverage our resources and reserves to capture similar value appreciation.
We're focused on achieving significant milestones that will not only reflect the rising tide of uranium prices but also distinguish us through meticulous preparation, our dedicated team, and a deep understanding of market dynamics. Our goal is to deliver substantial value to shareholders by strategically positioning Deep Yellow ahead of the curve in addressing the future supply needs of the uranium market. We recognize the imperative to differentiate ourselves from the existing landscape of uranium companies, ensuring we're not complacent but rather proactive and innovative in our approach. This forward-thinking strategy is essential as we navigate towards meeting the substantial future demand for uranium.
 Well, thank you John. And thanks for your time for participating in this CEO chat.
 It's a pleasure, Steven.
