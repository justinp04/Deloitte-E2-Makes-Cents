Endeavour Group Limited's (ASX:EDV) Fundamentals Look Pretty Strong: Could The Market Be Wrong About The Stock?

With its stock down 11% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard Endeavour Group (ASX:EDV). But if you pay close attention, you might find that its key financial indicators look quite decent, which could mean that the stock could potentially rise in the long-term given how markets usually reward more resilient long-term fundamentals. In this article, we decided to focus on 
 ROE.
ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Endeavour Group is:
14% = AU$529m ÷ AU$3.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).
The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every A$1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of A$0.14.
We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or "retains", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.
To begin with, Endeavour Group seems to have a respectable ROE. Yet, the fact that the company's ROE is lower than the industry average of 24% does temper our expectations. Although, we can see that Endeavour Group saw a modest net income growth of 19% over the past five years. So, there might be other aspects that are positively influencing earnings growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio. However, not to forget, the company does have a decent ROE to begin with, just that it is lower than the industry average. So this also provides some context to the earnings growth seen by the company.
We then performed a comparison between Endeavour Group's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 19% in the same 5-year period.
Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is EDV fairly valued? This
 has everything you need to know.
While Endeavour Group has a three-year median payout ratio of 73% (which means it retains 27% of profits), the company has still seen a fair bit of earnings growth in the past, meaning that its high payout ratio hasn't hampered its ability to grow.
While Endeavour Group has been growing its earnings, it only recently started to pay dividends which likely means that the company decided to impress new and existing shareholders with a dividend. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 72% of its profits over the next three years. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that Endeavour Group's future ROE will be 14% which is again, similar to the current ROE.
In total, it does look like Endeavour Group has some positive aspects to its business. Namely, its significant earnings growth, to which its moderate rate of return likely contributed. While the company is paying out most of its earnings as dividends, it has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's probably a good sign. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

Endeavour Group's (ASX:EDV) Dividend Will Be Reduced To A$0.075

 (
) dividend is being reduced by 2.6% to A$0.075 per share on 27th of September, in comparison to last year's comparable payment of A$0.077. However, the dividend yield of 3.9% still remains in a typical range for the industry.
We like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. Prior to this announcement, Endeavour Group's dividend was making up a very large proportion of earnings and perhaps more concerning was that it was 110% of cash flows. Paying out such a high proportion of cash flows certainly exposes the company to cutting the dividend if cash flows were to reduce.
Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 9.9%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 65% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.
The track record isn't the longest, but we are already seeing a bit of instability in the payments. Since 2021, the annual payment back then was A$0.07, compared to the most recent full-year payment of A$0.218. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 76% per annum over that time. It is great to see strong growth in the dividend payments, but cuts are concerning as it may indicate the payout policy is too ambitious.
Growing earnings per share could be a mitigating factor when considering the past fluctuations in the dividend. Endeavour Group has seen EPS rising for the last three years, at 62% per annum. However, Endeavour Group isn't reinvesting a lot back into the business, so we wonder how quickly it will be able to grow in the future.
In summary, dividends being cut isn't ideal, however it can bring the payment into a more sustainable range. With cash flows lacking, it is difficult to see how the company can sustain a dividend payment. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.
Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For instance, we've picked out 
 that investors should take into consideration. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas? Try our

Returns On Capital At Endeavour Group (ASX:EDV) Have Stalled

If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? Firstly, we'll want to see a proven 
 on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding 
 of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So, when we ran our eye over 
 (
) trend of ROCE, we liked what we saw.
For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Endeavour Group is:
0.11 = AU$1.0b ÷ (AU$12b - AU$2.1b) 
.
Therefore, 
 In isolation, that's a pretty standard return but against the Consumer Retailing industry average of 14%, it's not as good.
Above you can see how the current ROCE for Endeavour Group compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our 
 
.
The trend of ROCE doesn't stand out much, but returns on a whole are decent. The company has employed 37% more capital in the last two years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 11%. 11% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that Endeavour Group has consistently earned this amount. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.
One more thing to note, even though ROCE has remained relatively flat over the last two years, the reduction in current liabilities to 18% of total assets, is good to see from a business owner's perspective. This can eliminate some of the risks inherent in the operations because the business has less outstanding obligations to their suppliers and or short-term creditors than they did previously.
The main thing to remember is that Endeavour Group has proven its ability to continually reinvest at respectable rates of return. Yet over the last year the stock has declined 20%, so the decline might provide an opening. That's why we think it'd be worthwhile to look further into this stock given the fundamentals are appealing.
One more thing to note, we've identified 
and understanding them should be part of your investment process.
While Endeavour Group may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity. Check out this

Endeavour Group Limited (ASX:EDV) Shares Could Be 31% Below Their Intrinsic Value Estimate

Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Endeavour Group Limited (
) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.
Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the 
.
We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:
 = AU$4.5b
The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.7%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$722m× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.7%– 2.1%) = AU$16b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$16b÷ ( 1 + 6.7%)
= AU$8.4b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is AU$13b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of AU$5.0, the company appears quite good value at a 31% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.
We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Endeavour Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.921. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to "what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Endeavour Group, we've put together three essential aspects you should assess:

Endeavour Group Limited's (ASX:EDV) Stock On An Uptrend: Could Fundamentals Be Driving The Momentum?

Most readers would already be aware that Endeavour Group's (ASX:EDV) stock increased significantly by 15% over the past three months. As most would know, fundamentals are what usually guide market price movements over the long-term, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. Particularly, we will be paying attention to 
 ROE today.
ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Endeavour Group is:
14% = AU$529m ÷ AU$3.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).
The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each A$1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made A$0.14 in profit.
So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or "retains" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
To start with, Endeavour Group's ROE looks acceptable. Be that as it may, the company's ROE is still quite lower than the industry average of 24%. Although, we can see that Endeavour Group saw a modest net income growth of 19% over the past five years. We reckon that there could be other factors at play here. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio. However, not to forget, the company does have a decent ROE to begin with, just that it is lower than the industry average. So this also provides some context to the earnings growth seen by the company.
We then performed a comparison between Endeavour Group's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 19% in the same 5-year period.
The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is EDV fairly valued? This
 has everything you need to know.
While Endeavour Group has a three-year median payout ratio of 73% (which means it retains 27% of profits), the company has still seen a fair bit of earnings growth in the past, meaning that its high payout ratio hasn't hampered its ability to grow.
While Endeavour Group has been growing its earnings, it only recently started to pay dividends which likely means that the company decided to impress new and existing shareholders with a dividend. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 71%. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that Endeavour Group's future ROE will be 14% which is again, similar to the current ROE.
Overall, we feel that Endeavour Group certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Especially the substantial growth in earnings backed by a decent ROE. Despite the company reinvesting only a small portion of its profits, it still has managed to grow its earnings so that is appreciable. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

Endeavour Group Limited (ASX:EDV) Just Released Its Interim Earnings: Here's What Analysts Think

Last week saw the newest half-yearly earnings release from 
 (
), an important milestone in the company's journey to build a stronger business. Endeavour Group reported in line with analyst predictions, delivering revenues of AU$6.7b and statutory earnings per share of AU$0.20, suggesting the business is executing well and in line with its plan. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year.
Taking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for Endeavour Group from 13 analysts is for revenues of AU$12.3b in 2024. If met, it would imply a satisfactory 2.3% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory per-share earnings are expected to be AU$0.29, roughly flat on the last 12 months. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of AU$12.3b and earnings per share (EPS) of AU$0.29 in 2024. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates.
There were no changes to revenue or earnings estimates or the price target of AU$5.92, suggesting that the company has met expectations in its recent result. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. The most optimistic Endeavour Group analyst has a price target of AU$6.40 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at AU$5.20. Still, with such a tight range of estimates, it suggeststhe analysts have a pretty good idea of what they think the company is worth.
One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same 
 are performing. We would highlight that Endeavour Group's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 4.8% annualised growth rate until the end of 2024 being well below the historical 13% p.a. growth over the last three years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 3.4% annually. Even after the forecast slowdown in growth, it seems obvious that Endeavour Group is also expected to grow faster than the wider industry.
The most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at AU$5.92, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.
With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for Endeavour Group going out to 2026, and you can

You should always think about risks though. Case in point, we've spotted

We Like These Underlying Return On Capital Trends At Endeavour Group (ASX:EDV)

To find a multi-bagger stock, what are the underlying trends we should look for in a business? Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing 
 on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's 
 of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So on that note, 
 (
) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.
If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Endeavour Group, this is the formula:
0.11 = AU$1.0b ÷ (AU$12b - AU$2.7b) 
.
Therefore, 
 By itself that's a normal return on capital and it's in line with the industry's average returns of 11%.
In the above chart we have measured Endeavour Group's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our 
 
.
The trends we've noticed at Endeavour Group are quite reassuring. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last three years to 11%. Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 31% more capital is being employed now too. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Endeavour Group thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.
In another part of our analysis, we noticed that the company's ratio of current liabilities to total assets decreased to 22%, which broadly means the business is relying less on its suppliers or short-term creditors to fund its operations. This tells us that Endeavour Group has grown its returns without a reliance on increasing their current liabilities, which we're very happy with.
A company that is growing its returns on capital and can consistently reinvest in itself is a highly sought after trait, and that's what Endeavour Group has. Astute investors may have an opportunity here because the stock has declined 20% in the last year. So researching this company further and determining whether or not these trends will continue seems justified.
If you'd like to know about the risks facing Endeavour Group, we've discovered 
 that you should be aware of.

Is Endeavour Group Limited's (ASX:EDV) Stock's Recent Performance A Reflection Of Its Financial Health?

Most readers would already know that Endeavour Group's (ASX:EDV) stock increased by 4.2% over the past month. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. In this article, we decided to focus on 
 ROE.
Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Endeavour Group is:
13% = AU$516m ÷ AU$3.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).
The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every A$1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn A$0.13 in profit.
We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or "retains" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
To start with, Endeavour Group's ROE looks acceptable. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 11%. This probably goes some way in explaining Endeavour Group's significant 30% net income growth over the past five years amongst other factors. We believe that there might also be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.
We then compared Endeavour Group's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 13% in the same 5-year period.
Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for EDV? You can find out in
Endeavour Group's significant three-year median payout ratio of 73% (where it is retaining only 27% of its income) suggests that the company has been able to achieve a high growth in earnings despite returning most of its income to shareholders.
Moreover, Endeavour Group is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of three years of paying a dividend. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 73%. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that Endeavour Group's future ROE will be 14% which is again, similar to the current ROE.
Overall, we are quite pleased with Endeavour Group's performance. Especially the high ROE, Which has contributed to the impressive growth seen in earnings. Despite the company reinvesting only a small portion of its profits, it still has managed to grow its earnings so that is appreciable. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

Are Investors Undervaluing Endeavour Group Limited (ASX:EDV) By 28%?

Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Endeavour Group Limited (
) as an investment opportunity by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.
Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the 
.
We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:
 = AU$4.5b
After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.3%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$655m× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.3%– 2.2%) = AU$16b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$16b÷ ( 1 + 6.3%)
= AU$8.8b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is AU$13b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of AU$5.4, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 28% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.
The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Endeavour Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.900. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to "what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Endeavour Group, we've put together three further elements you should further examine:

Endeavour Group's (ASX:EDV) Dividend Will Be Reduced To A$0.075

 (
) dividend is being reduced by 2.6% to A$0.075 per share on 27th of September, in comparison to last year's comparable payment of A$0.077. However, the dividend yield of 3.9% still remains in a typical range for the industry.
We like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. Prior to this announcement, Endeavour Group's dividend was making up a very large proportion of earnings and perhaps more concerning was that it was 110% of cash flows. Paying out such a high proportion of cash flows certainly exposes the company to cutting the dividend if cash flows were to reduce.
Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 9.9%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 65% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.
The track record isn't the longest, but we are already seeing a bit of instability in the payments. Since 2021, the annual payment back then was A$0.07, compared to the most recent full-year payment of A$0.218. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 76% per annum over that time. It is great to see strong growth in the dividend payments, but cuts are concerning as it may indicate the payout policy is too ambitious.
Growing earnings per share could be a mitigating factor when considering the past fluctuations in the dividend. Endeavour Group has seen EPS rising for the last three years, at 62% per annum. However, Endeavour Group isn't reinvesting a lot back into the business, so we wonder how quickly it will be able to grow in the future.
In summary, dividends being cut isn't ideal, however it can bring the payment into a more sustainable range. With cash flows lacking, it is difficult to see how the company can sustain a dividend payment. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.
Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For instance, we've picked out

Endeavour Group Limited's (ASX:EDV) Fundamentals Look Pretty Strong: Could The Market Be Wrong About The Stock?

With its stock down 11% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard Endeavour Group (ASX:EDV). But if you pay close attention, you might find that its key financial indicators look quite decent, which could mean that the stock could potentially rise in the long-term given how markets usually reward more resilient long-term fundamentals. In this article, we decided to focus on 
 ROE.
ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Endeavour Group is:
14% = AU$529m ÷ AU$3.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).
The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every A$1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of A$0.14.
We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or "retains", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.
To begin with, Endeavour Group seems to have a respectable ROE. Yet, the fact that the company's ROE is lower than the industry average of 24% does temper our expectations. Although, we can see that Endeavour Group saw a modest net income growth of 19% over the past five years. So, there might be other aspects that are positively influencing earnings growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio. However, not to forget, the company does have a decent ROE to begin with, just that it is lower than the industry average. So this also provides some context to the earnings growth seen by the company.
We then performed a comparison between Endeavour Group's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 19% in the same 5-year period.
Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is EDV fairly valued? This
 has everything you need to know.
While Endeavour Group has a three-year median payout ratio of 73% (which means it retains 27% of profits), the company has still seen a fair bit of earnings growth in the past, meaning that its high payout ratio hasn't hampered its ability to grow.
While Endeavour Group has been growing its earnings, it only recently started to pay dividends which likely means that the company decided to impress new and existing shareholders with a dividend. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 72% of its profits over the next three years. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that Endeavour Group's future ROE will be 14% which is again, similar to the current ROE.
In total, it does look like Endeavour Group has some positive aspects to its business. Namely, its significant earnings growth, to which its moderate rate of return likely contributed. While the company is paying out most of its earnings as dividends, it has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's probably a good sign. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

Returns On Capital At Endeavour Group (ASX:EDV) Have Stalled

If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? Firstly, we'll want to see a proven 
 on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding 
 of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So, when we ran our eye over 
 (
) trend of ROCE, we liked what we saw.
For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Endeavour Group is:
0.11 = AU$1.0b ÷ (AU$12b - AU$2.1b) 
.
Therefore, 
 In isolation, that's a pretty standard return but against the Consumer Retailing industry average of 14%, it's not as good.
Above you can see how the current ROCE for Endeavour Group compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our 
 
.
The trend of ROCE doesn't stand out much, but returns on a whole are decent. The company has employed 37% more capital in the last two years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 11%. 11% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that Endeavour Group has consistently earned this amount. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.
One more thing to note, even though ROCE has remained relatively flat over the last two years, the reduction in current liabilities to 18% of total assets, is good to see from a business owner's perspective. This can eliminate some of the risks inherent in the operations because the business has less outstanding obligations to their suppliers and or short-term creditors than they did previously.
The main thing to remember is that Endeavour Group has proven its ability to continually reinvest at respectable rates of return. Yet over the last year the stock has declined 20%, so the decline might provide an opening. That's why we think it'd be worthwhile to look further into this stock given the fundamentals are appealing.
One more thing to note, we've identified 
and understanding them should be part of your investment process.

Endeavour Group Limited (ASX:EDV) Shares Could Be 31% Below Their Intrinsic Value Estimate

Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Endeavour Group Limited (
) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.
Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the 
.
We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:
 = AU$4.5b
The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.7%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$722m× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.7%– 2.1%) = AU$16b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$16b÷ ( 1 + 6.7%)
= AU$8.4b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is AU$13b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of AU$5.0, the company appears quite good value at a 31% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.
We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Endeavour Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.921. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to "what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Endeavour Group, we've put together three essential aspects you should assess:

We Like These Underlying Return On Capital Trends At Endeavour Group (ASX:EDV)

To find a multi-bagger stock, what are the underlying trends we should look for in a business? Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing 
 on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's 
 of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So on that note, 
 (
) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.
If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Endeavour Group, this is the formula:
0.11 = AU$1.0b ÷ (AU$12b - AU$2.7b) 
.
Therefore, 
 By itself that's a normal return on capital and it's in line with the industry's average returns of 11%.
In the above chart we have measured Endeavour Group's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our 
 
.
The trends we've noticed at Endeavour Group are quite reassuring. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last three years to 11%. Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 31% more capital is being employed now too. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Endeavour Group thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.
In another part of our analysis, we noticed that the company's ratio of current liabilities to total assets decreased to 22%, which broadly means the business is relying less on its suppliers or short-term creditors to fund its operations. This tells us that Endeavour Group has grown its returns without a reliance on increasing their current liabilities, which we're very happy with.
A company that is growing its returns on capital and can consistently reinvest in itself is a highly sought after trait, and that's what Endeavour Group has. Astute investors may have an opportunity here because the stock has declined 20% in the last year. So researching this company further and determining whether or not these trends will continue seems justified.

Endeavour Group Limited (ASX:EDV) Just Released Its Interim Earnings: Here's What Analysts Think

Last week saw the newest half-yearly earnings release from 
 (
), an important milestone in the company's journey to build a stronger business. Endeavour Group reported in line with analyst predictions, delivering revenues of AU$6.7b and statutory earnings per share of AU$0.20, suggesting the business is executing well and in line with its plan. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year.
Taking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for Endeavour Group from 13 analysts is for revenues of AU$12.3b in 2024. If met, it would imply a satisfactory 2.3% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory per-share earnings are expected to be AU$0.29, roughly flat on the last 12 months. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of AU$12.3b and earnings per share (EPS) of AU$0.29 in 2024. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates.
There were no changes to revenue or earnings estimates or the price target of AU$5.92, suggesting that the company has met expectations in its recent result. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. The most optimistic Endeavour Group analyst has a price target of AU$6.40 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at AU$5.20. Still, with such a tight range of estimates, it suggeststhe analysts have a pretty good idea of what they think the company is worth.
One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same 
 are performing. We would highlight that Endeavour Group's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 4.8% annualised growth rate until the end of 2024 being well below the historical 13% p.a. growth over the last three years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 3.4% annually. Even after the forecast slowdown in growth, it seems obvious that Endeavour Group is also expected to grow faster than the wider industry.
The most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at AU$5.92, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.
With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for Endeavour Group going out to 2026, and you can

Are Investors Undervaluing Endeavour Group Limited (ASX:EDV) By 28%?

Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Endeavour Group Limited (
) as an investment opportunity by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.
Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the 
.
We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:
 = AU$4.5b
After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.3%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$655m× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.3%– 2.2%) = AU$16b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$16b÷ ( 1 + 6.3%)
= AU$8.8b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is AU$13b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of AU$5.4, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 28% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.
The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Endeavour Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.900. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to "what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Endeavour Group, we've put together three further elements you should further examine:

Endeavour Group Limited's (ASX:EDV) Stock On An Uptrend: Could Fundamentals Be Driving The Momentum?

Most readers would already be aware that Endeavour Group's (ASX:EDV) stock increased significantly by 15% over the past three months. As most would know, fundamentals are what usually guide market price movements over the long-term, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. Particularly, we will be paying attention to 
 ROE today.
ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Endeavour Group is:
14% = AU$529m ÷ AU$3.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).
The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each A$1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made A$0.14 in profit.
So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or "retains" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
To start with, Endeavour Group's ROE looks acceptable. Be that as it may, the company's ROE is still quite lower than the industry average of 24%. Although, we can see that Endeavour Group saw a modest net income growth of 19% over the past five years. We reckon that there could be other factors at play here. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio. However, not to forget, the company does have a decent ROE to begin with, just that it is lower than the industry average. So this also provides some context to the earnings growth seen by the company.
We then performed a comparison between Endeavour Group's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 19% in the same 5-year period.
The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is EDV fairly valued? This
 has everything you need to know.
While Endeavour Group has a three-year median payout ratio of 73% (which means it retains 27% of profits), the company has still seen a fair bit of earnings growth in the past, meaning that its high payout ratio hasn't hampered its ability to grow.
While Endeavour Group has been growing its earnings, it only recently started to pay dividends which likely means that the company decided to impress new and existing shareholders with a dividend. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 71%. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that Endeavour Group's future ROE will be 14% which is again, similar to the current ROE.
Overall, we feel that Endeavour Group certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Especially the substantial growth in earnings backed by a decent ROE. Despite the company reinvesting only a small portion of its profits, it still has managed to grow its earnings so that is appreciable. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth. To know more about the company's future earnings growth forecasts take a look at this

Is Endeavour Group Limited's (ASX:EDV) Stock's Recent Performance A Reflection Of Its Financial Health?

Most readers would already know that Endeavour Group's (ASX:EDV) stock increased by 4.2% over the past month. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. In this article, we decided to focus on 
 ROE.
Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Endeavour Group is:
13% = AU$516m ÷ AU$3.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).
The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every A$1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn A$0.13 in profit.
We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or "retains" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
To start with, Endeavour Group's ROE looks acceptable. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 11%. This probably goes some way in explaining Endeavour Group's significant 30% net income growth over the past five years amongst other factors. We believe that there might also be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.
We then compared Endeavour Group's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 13% in the same 5-year period.
Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for EDV? You can find out in
Endeavour Group's significant three-year median payout ratio of 73% (where it is retaining only 27% of its income) suggests that the company has been able to achieve a high growth in earnings despite returning most of its income to shareholders.
Moreover, Endeavour Group is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of three years of paying a dividend. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 73%. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that Endeavour Group's future ROE will be 14% which is again, similar to the current ROE.
Overall, we are quite pleased with Endeavour Group's performance. Especially the high ROE, Which has contributed to the impressive growth seen in earnings. Despite the company reinvesting only a small portion of its profits, it still has managed to grow its earnings so that is appreciable. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?
