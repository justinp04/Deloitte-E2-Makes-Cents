Analysts Expect EML Payments Limited (ASX:EML) To Breakeven Soon 2023-10-30T22:42:43.000Z

 is possibly approaching a major achievement in its business, so we would like to shine some light on the company. EML Payments Limited provides payment solutions platform in Australia, Europe, and North America. The AU$408m market-cap company announced a latest loss of AU$285m on 30 June 2023 for its most recent financial year result. As path to profitability is the topic on EML Payments' investors mind, we've decided to gauge market sentiment. Below we will provide a high-level summary of the industry analysts’ expectations for the company.
According to the 6 industry analysts covering EML Payments, the consensus is that breakeven is near. They expect the company to post a final loss in 2023, before turning a profit of AU$27m in 2024. Therefore, the company is expected to breakeven roughly 12 months from now or less. At what rate will the company have to grow in order to realise the consensus estimates forecasting breakeven in under 12 months? Using a line of best fit, we calculated an average annual growth rate of 108%, which signals high confidence from analysts. Should the business grow at a slower rate, it will become profitable at a later date than expected.
Given this is a high-level overview, we won’t go into details of EML Payments' upcoming projects, however, keep in mind that generally a high forecast growth rate is not unusual for a company that is currently undergoing an investment period.
Before we wrap up, there’s one issue worth mentioning. EML Payments currently has a relatively high level of debt. Generally, the rule of thumb is debt shouldn’t exceed 40% of your equity, which in EML Payments' case is 53%. Note that a higher debt obligation increases the risk around investing in the loss-making company.

With 37% stake, EML Payments Limited (ASX:EML) seems to have captured institutional investors' interest 2023-11-27T01:04:09.000Z

A look at the shareholders of EML Payments Limited (
) can tell us which group is most powerful. With 37% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.
Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.
Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about EML Payments.
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
We can see that EML Payments does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see EML Payments' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
Our data indicates that hedge funds own 8.1% of EML Payments. That catches my attention because hedge funds sometimes try to influence management, or bring about changes that will create near term value for shareholders. First Sentier Investors (Australia) IM Ltd is currently the company's largest shareholder with 10% of shares outstanding. The second and third largest shareholders are Alta Fox Capital Management, LLC and Patrick Haley, with an equal amount of shares to their name at 8.1%. Patrick Haley, who is the third-largest shareholder, also happens to hold the title of Member of the Board of Directors.
On further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 9 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.
I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.
Our most recent data indicates that insiders own a reasonable proportion of EML Payments Limited. Insiders own AU$46m worth of shares in the AU$414m company. It is great to see insiders so invested in the business. It might be worth checking 
The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 35% stake in EML Payments. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.
Private equity firms hold a 5.4% stake in EML Payments. This suggests they can be influential in key policy decisions. Some investors might be encouraged by this, since private equity are sometimes able to encourage strategies that help the market see the value in the company. Alternatively, those holders might be exiting the investment after taking it public.
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

EML Payments (ASX:EML) shareholders have endured a 79% loss from investing in the stock three years ago 2024-01-07T00:25:21.000Z

As an investor, mistakes are inevitable. But you want to avoid the really big losses like the plague. So take a moment to sympathize with the long term shareholders of 
 (ASX:EML), who have seen the share price tank a massive 79% over a three year period. That'd be enough to cause even the strongest minds some disquiet. Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 29% in the last 90 days.
Since shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns.
Because EML Payments made a loss in the last twelve months, we think the market is probably more focussed on revenue and revenue growth, at least for now. When a company doesn't make profits, we'd generally expect to see good revenue growth. That's because it's hard to be confident a company will be sustainable if revenue growth is negligible, and it never makes a profit.
Over three years, EML Payments grew revenue at 21% per year. That is faster than most pre-profit companies. So on the face of it we're really surprised to see the share price down 21% a year in the same time period. The share price makes us wonder if there is an issue with profitability. Sometimes fast revenue growth doesn't lead to profits. If the company is low on cash, it may have to raise capital soon.
The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).
It's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. If you are thinking of buying or selling EML Payments stock, you should check out this 
 report showing analyst profit forecasts.
We're pleased to report that EML Payments shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 25% over one year. That certainly beats the loss of about 8% per year over the last half decade. The long term loss makes us cautious, but the short term TSR gain certainly hints at a brighter future. You could get a better understanding of EML Payments' growth by checking out this more detailed historical graph of earnings, revenue and cash flow.

Get in Quick! 7 AI Penny Stocks That Are About to Pop Soon 2024-03-13T13:32:50.000Z

Many of us dream of getting in early on the next big thing, such as a groundbreaking company that goes on to deliver jaw-dropping returns to early investors. Artificial intelligence feels like one of those once-in-a-generation opportunities. AI has already transformed industries from healthcare to transportation, and its potential seems limitless.
The problem? 
 have been taking off like rockets lately, with share prices soaring to sky-high valuations. Buying now may prompt feelings of FOMO (fear of missing out) for current investors. Indeed, while I love the long-term potential of this space, I’m not thrilled about buying these frothy, overhyped stocks at current levels.
AI 
 offer much more explosive upside in the near-term. Yes, penny stocks are notoriously risky, with huge price swings commonplace. And many will turn out to be total duds. But if you pick the right ones early and have the stomach for volatility, massive returns are possible. Here are seven to look into.

 (NASDAQ:
) uses artificial intelligence to identify people, with applications that could prove invaluable for law enforcement and government agencies. Judging by its latest financials, Aware seems to be hitting its stride.
In Q3 2023, Aware delivered triple-digit sales growth. 
 compared to the same quarter last year. Profitability remains slim, which is typical for a small-cap tech stock. But what impresses me most is that Aware isn’t hemorrhaging cash, a rarity among SaaS startups.
Recent contract wins validate my conviction that Aware is one of the best AI penny stocks. The company 
 that, including annual maintenance options, has a 5-year value of up to $5.1 million. This expands Aware’s footprint with the U.S. government. Aware also began recognizing revenue from the 5-year, $5 million contract it landed last quarter with its largest biometric services customer.
Management pointed out that both contracts reflect the trust leading government agencies place in Aware, and when combined with the new AwareABIS, contracts are expected to contribute more than $1.5 million to the company’s annual recurring revenue.
With more government agencies and departments added to its client roster, I believe Aware’s revenues could march significantly higher over the long-term. Biometrics represents a critical growth arena as digital ID becomes universal. Aware looks well-positioned to capitalize on this trend as a pioneer in the space.

 (OTCMKTS:
) produces and sells silicon materials used in solar panels and semiconductors worldwide. The company’s main products are silicon materials sold to manufacturers of solar wafers and chips. I’m bullish on Rec Silicon’s growth drivers and upside potential.
Analysts 
 for Rec Silicon in 2024. Consensus estimates call for $351 million in sales this year, up sharply from $141 million in 2023. Additionally, revenue is projected to reach $606 million by 2026 as demand for solar energy booms.
Meanwhile, Rec Silicon is evolving its business mix. The company is discontinuing its EG polysilicon production in 2024 while optimizing its Butte production. Since silane gas is Rec Silicon’s largest product line, reallocating resources to maximize silane output over the long-term seems like a smart strategic move.
Between surging market demand, streamlining its production, and silane capacity expansion, Rec Silicon has multiple avenues for top-line growth. Its prospects appear bright as the solar industry’s future shines.

The technology provides a deep natural language understanding of complex documents, social media, and other unstructured text sources. Expert.ai combines machine learning, knowledge representation, and large language models to generate high-quality, explainable results.
With capabilities like intelligent document processing, domain-specific language modeling, and custom natural language solutions, Expert.AI taps into immense market demand for data analytics. As an AI innovator, I believe Expert.AI is attractively positioned to win major enterprise contracts.
Validating my bullish thesis, EXSPF stock has nearly doubled over the past year. Shares are up 97%, signaling that the company is executing well and the market sees its potential.

 (NASDAQ:
) has been on my radar for a while, and my conviction recently paid off handsomely! Even with shares breaking a bit above $5 per share, I firmly believe the party is just getting started for this under-the-radar gem. The company’s small market cap still makes it count as a penny stock in my eyes.
Sure, at first glance Data Storage may seem a bit pricey based on traditional valuation metrics. But when you consider the company’s trajectory and future potential, that premium looks like a bargain. Data Storage still trades at a significant discount to industry leaders, leaving ample room for growth in the coming months.
We’re already seeing early signs of a hypergrowth inflection point, with 
. Notably, the company’s revenue came in nearly 20% above Wall Street’s expectations! Data Storage’s 
 for the quarter, with net income over $800,000 and EBITDA exceeding $1.1 million. For a business still off most investors’ radar, these are impressive figures.
With metrics like these, I believe it’s only a matter of time before Wall Street takes notice and sends DTST stock to new highs. The company provides critical business continuity services, including disaster recovery, infrastructure-as-a-service, and cybersecurity offerings. Demand for these solutions will only grow as data security becomes more paramount.
CloudFirst was merged with Flagship Solutions Group recently for more efficiency. As both a value and growth play, I’m very bullish on DTST stock as a long-term hold with multi-bagger potential. If the stars align, this can become one of the best AI penny stocks in the market moving forward.
As digital transformation accelerates globally, search engine optimization is becoming increasingly vital for businesses seeking visibility online. That’s why I’m bullish on 
 (OTCMKTS:
), a leading advertising technology platform automating day-to-day SEO tasks. I think it is one of the top AI penny stocks in its sector.
Even offline companies require an online presence nowadays. SEO can make or break that presence, determining search rankings and web traffic. Adcore provides automated solutions for search marketing, though it remains a small player in this vast industry.
After plummeting more than 90% from its peak, ADCOF stock has traded sideways around 17-20 cents for two years now. But with rock-solid execution lately, I believe a major breakout to the upside could be close.
Adcore 
 in Q3 2023, with revenue up 11.5% to $6.1 million. As growth and profitability improve, this microcap stock could potentially deliver outsized returns. Adcore still has immense room to run before reaching its full recovery.
I’m very optimistic that Adcore’s automated search marketing solutions position it for sustainable growth in the years ahead. This remains a speculative play, but the risk-reward profile looks highly compelling for this stock at current levels.

As a fintech and financial education company increasingly incorporating AI, 
(OTCMKTS:
) has my attention. The company assists self-directed investors in various markets including stocks, options, forex, and crypto.
Despite trading around just 1-2 cents for the past two years, I believe INVU could climb significantly higher with solid execution. It’s still early innings for this micro-cap stock.
Revenue 
. Investview is on pace for around $65-75 million in total 2023 revenue, far above its $38 million market cap today. Even better, the company has been profitable for three straight quarters – a rarity among early-stage SaaS players.
By combining digital financial education and AI-enhanced advisory services, Investview hits a market sweet spot. Its focus on self-directed investors also provides an immense total addressable market opportunity.
At current valuation levels, I think Investview offers compelling risk/reward. If the company sustains its growth trajectory and profitability, the upside from here could prove tremendous. This is a speculative micro-cap play worth monitoring closely.

 (OTCMKTS:

Additionally, the company’s revenue

Loss-Making EML Payments Limited (ASX:EML) Expected To Breakeven In The Medium-Term 2024-04-08T01:20:56.000Z

With the business potentially at an important milestone, we thought we'd take a closer look at 
 future prospects. EML Payments Limited provides payment solutions platform in Australia, Europe, and North America. With the latest financial year loss of AU$285m and a trailing-twelve-month loss of AU$167m, the AU$418m market-cap company alleviated its loss by moving closer towards its target of breakeven. The most pressing concern for investors is EML Payments' path to profitability – when will it breakeven? In this article, we will touch on the expectations for the company's growth and when analysts expect it to become profitable.
Consensus from 6 of the Australian Diversified Financial analysts is that EML Payments is on the verge of breakeven. They anticipate the company to incur a final loss in 2024, before generating positive profits of AU$22m in 2025. Therefore, the company is expected to breakeven just over a year from today. How fast will the company have to grow each year in order to reach the breakeven point by 2025? Working backwards from analyst estimates, it turns out that they expect the company to grow 87% year-on-year, on average, which is rather optimistic! Should the business grow at a slower rate, it will become profitable at a later date than expected.
Given this is a high-level overview, we won’t go into details of EML Payments' upcoming projects, but, keep in mind that generally a high forecast growth rate is not unusual for a company that is currently undergoing an investment period.
Before we wrap up, there’s one issue worth mentioning. EML Payments currently has a relatively high level of debt. Typically, debt shouldn’t exceed 40% of your equity, which in EML Payments' case is 55%. Note that a higher debt obligation increases the risk around investing in the loss-making company.
There are too many aspects of EML Payments to cover in one brief article, but the key fundamentals for the company can all be found in one place – 
. We've also put together a list of key factors you should look at:
 
================================================================================

EML Payments Limited (ASX:EML) most popular amongst individual investors who own 45% of the shares, institutions hold 35% 2024-05-06T01:27:07.000Z

To get a sense of who is truly in control of EML Payments Limited (
), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 45% to be precise, is individual investors. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
Institutions, on the other hand, account for 35% of the company's stockholders. Insiders often own a large chunk of younger, smaller, companies while huge companies tend to have institutions as shareholders.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of EML Payments.
Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.
EML Payments already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at EML Payments' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.
EML Payments is not owned by hedge funds. Patrick Haley is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.1% of shares outstanding. Viburnum Funds Pty Ltd. is the second largest shareholder owning 6.5% of common stock, and Wilson Asset Management (International) Pty Ltd. holds about 6.1% of the company stock.
After doing some more digging, we found that the top 15 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.
While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.
Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.
It seems insiders own a significant proportion of EML Payments Limited. Insiders own AU$41m worth of shares in the AU$371m company. This may suggest that the founders still own a lot of shares. You can 
With a 45% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over EML Payments. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.
With an ownership of 6.5%, private equity firms are in a position to play a role in shaping corporate strategy with a focus on value creation. Sometimes we see private equity stick around for the long term, but generally speaking they have a shorter investment horizon and -- as the name suggests -- don't invest in public companies much. After some time they may look to sell and redeploy capital elsewhere.
I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

EML Payments (ASX:EML) shareholders have endured a 76% loss from investing in the stock three years ago 2024-06-15T00:53:24.000Z

It's not possible to invest over long periods without making some bad investments. But you have a problem if you face massive losses more than once in a while. So take a moment to sympathize with the long term shareholders of 
 (
), who have seen the share price tank a massive 76% over a three year period. That would certainly shake our confidence in the decision to own the stock. Furthermore, it's down 28% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders.
So let's have a look and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.
EML Payments isn't currently profitable, so most analysts would look to revenue growth to get an idea of how fast the underlying business is growing. Shareholders of unprofitable companies usually desire strong revenue growth. As you can imagine, fast revenue growth, when maintained, often leads to fast profit growth.
In the last three years, EML Payments saw its revenue grow by 17% per year, compound. That's a pretty good rate of top-line growth. So it's hard to believe the share price decline of 21% per year is due to the revenue. More likely, the market was spooked by the cost of that revenue. This is exactly why investors need to diversify - even when a loss making company grows revenue, it can fail to deliver for shareholders.
You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).
It's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. You can see what analysts are predicting for EML Payments in this 
 
.
It's good to see that EML Payments has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 45% in the last twelve months. Notably the five-year annualised TSR loss of 11% per year compares very unfavourably with the recent share price performance. The long term loss makes us cautious, but the short term TSR gain certainly hints at a brighter future. You could get a better understanding of EML Payments' growth by checking out

So on the face of it we're really surprised to see the share price down 21% a year in the same time period. The share price makes us wonder if there is an issue with profitability. Sometimes fast revenue growth doesn't lead to profits. If the company is low on cash, it may have to raise capital soon.

It's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years.

 report showing analyst profit forecasts.
We're pleased to report that EML Payments shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 25% over one year. That certainly beats the loss of about 8% per year over the last half decade. The long term loss makes us cautious, but the short term TSR gain certainly hints at a brighter future.

Get in Quick! 7 AI Penny Stocks That Are About to Pop Soon 2024-03-13T13:32:50.000Z

Many of us dream of getting in early on the next big thing, such as a groundbreaking company that goes on to deliver jaw-dropping returns to early investors. Artificial intelligence feels like one of those once-in-a-generation opportunities. AI has already transformed industries from healthcare to transportation, and its potential seems limitless.
The problem? 
 have been taking off like rockets lately, with share prices soaring to sky-high valuations. Buying now may prompt feelings of FOMO (fear of missing out) for current investors. Indeed, while I love the long-term potential of this space, I’m not thrilled about buying these frothy, overhyped stocks at current levels.
AI 
 offer much more explosive upside in the near-term. Yes, penny stocks are notoriously risky, with huge price swings commonplace. And many will turn out to be total duds. But if you pick the right ones early and have the stomach for volatility, massive returns are possible. Here are seven to look into.

 (NASDAQ:
) uses artificial intelligence to identify people, with applications that could prove invaluable for law enforcement and government agencies. Judging by its latest financials, Aware seems to be hitting its stride.
In Q3 2023, Aware delivered triple-digit sales growth. 
 compared to the same quarter last year. Profitability remains slim, which is typical for a small-cap tech stock. But what impresses me most is that Aware isn’t hemorrhaging cash, a rarity among SaaS startups.
Recent contract wins validate my conviction that Aware is one of the best AI penny stocks. The company 
 that, including annual maintenance options, has a 5-year value of up to $5.1 million. This expands Aware’s footprint with the U.S. government. Aware also began recognizing revenue from the 5-year, $5 million contract it landed last quarter with its largest biometric services customer.
Management pointed out that both contracts reflect the trust leading government agencies place in Aware, and when combined with the new AwareABIS, contracts are expected to contribute more than $1.5 million to the company’s annual recurring revenue.
With more government agencies and departments added to its client roster, I believe Aware’s revenues could march significantly higher over the long-term. Biometrics represents a critical growth arena as digital ID becomes universal. Aware looks well-positioned to capitalize on this trend as a pioneer in the space.

 (OTCMKTS:
) produces and sells silicon materials used in solar panels and semiconductors worldwide. The company’s main products are silicon materials sold to manufacturers of solar wafers and chips. I’m bullish on Rec Silicon’s growth drivers and upside potential.
Analysts 
 for Rec Silicon in 2024. Consensus estimates call for $351 million in sales this year, up sharply from $141 million in 2023. Additionally, revenue is projected to reach $606 million by 2026 as demand for solar energy booms.
Meanwhile, Rec Silicon is evolving its business mix. The company is discontinuing its EG polysilicon production in 2024 while optimizing its Butte production. Since silane gas is Rec Silicon’s largest product line, reallocating resources to maximize silane output over the long-term seems like a smart strategic move.
Between surging market demand, streamlining its production, and silane capacity expansion, Rec Silicon has multiple avenues for top-line growth. Its prospects appear bright as the solar industry’s future shines.

) offers a hybrid artificial intelligence platform that transforms text into actionable knowledge and insights. The technology provides a deep natural language understanding of complex documents, social media, and other unstructured text sources. Expert.ai combines machine learning, knowledge representation, and large language models to generate high-quality, explainable results.
With capabilities like intelligent document processing, domain-specific language modeling, and custom natural language solutions, Expert.AI taps into immense market demand for data analytics. As an AI innovator, I believe Expert.AI is attractively positioned to win major enterprise contracts.
Validating my bullish thesis, EXSPF stock has nearly doubled over the past year. Shares are up 97%, signaling that the company is executing well and the market sees its potential.

 (NASDAQ:
) has been on my radar for a while, and my conviction recently paid off handsomely! Even with shares breaking a bit above $5 per share, I firmly believe the party is just getting started for this under-the-radar gem. The company’s small market cap still makes it count as a penny stock in my eyes.
Sure, at first glance Data Storage may seem a bit pricey based on traditional valuation metrics. But when you consider the company’s trajectory and future potential, that premium looks like a bargain. Data Storage still trades at a significant discount to industry leaders, leaving ample room for growth in the coming months.
We’re already seeing early signs of a hypergrowth inflection point, with 
. Notably, the company’s revenue came in nearly 20% above Wall Street’s expectations! Data Storage’s 
 for the quarter, with net income over $800,000 and EBITDA exceeding $1.1 million. For a business still off most investors’ radar, these are impressive figures.
With metrics like these, I believe it’s only a matter of time before Wall Street takes notice and sends DTST stock to new highs. The company provides critical business continuity services, including disaster recovery, infrastructure-as-a-service, and cybersecurity offerings. Demand for these solutions will only grow as data security becomes more paramount.
CloudFirst was merged with Flagship Solutions Group recently for more efficiency. As both a value and growth play, I’m very bullish on DTST stock as a long-term hold with multi-bagger potential. If the stars align, this can become one of the best AI penny stocks in the market moving forward.
As digital transformation accelerates globally, search engine optimization is becoming increasingly vital for businesses seeking visibility online. That’s why I’m bullish on 
 (OTCMKTS:
), a leading advertising technology platform automating day-to-day SEO tasks. I think it is one of the top AI penny stocks in its sector.
Even offline companies require an online presence nowadays. SEO can make or break that presence, determining search rankings and web traffic. Adcore provides automated solutions for search marketing, though it remains a small player in this vast industry.
After plummeting more than 90% from its peak, ADCOF stock has traded sideways around 17-20 cents for two years now. But with rock-solid execution lately, I believe a major breakout to the upside could be close.
Adcore 
 in Q3 2023, with revenue up 11.5% to $6.1 million. As growth and profitability improve, this microcap stock could potentially deliver outsized returns. Adcore still has immense room to run before reaching its full recovery.
I’m very optimistic that Adcore’s automated search marketing solutions position it for sustainable growth in the years ahead. This remains a speculative play, but the risk-reward profile looks highly compelling for this stock at current levels.

As a fintech and financial education company increasingly incorporating AI, 
(OTCMKTS:
) has my attention. The company assists self-directed investors in various markets including stocks, options, forex, and crypto.
Despite trading around just 1-2 cents for the past two years, I believe INVU could climb significantly higher with solid execution. It’s still early innings for this micro-cap stock.
Revenue 
. Investview is on pace for around $65-75 million in total 2023 revenue, far above its $38 million market cap today. Even better, the company has been profitable for three straight quarters – a rarity among early-stage SaaS players.
By combining digital financial education and AI-enhanced advisory services, Investview hits a market sweet spot. Its focus on self-directed investors also provides an immense total addressable market opportunity.
At current valuation levels, I think Investview offers compelling risk/reward. If the company sustains its growth trajectory and profitability, the upside from here could prove tremendous. This is a speculative micro-cap play worth monitoring closely.

 (OTCMKTS:
) is a fintech infrastructure company enabling real-time payments and prepaid cards. While not directly involved in AI, EML does leverage AI and machine learning for its personal finance management tools.
After stumbling in recent years, EMCHF stock is making an impressive comeback. Shares have surged around 130% over the past 12 months to nearly 70 cents today. This aligns with strengthening financials and a return to growth.
Additionally, the company’s revenue 
, with profitability potentially on the horizon. As business momentum builds, I’m optimistic that EML can sustain its resurgence.
The total addressable market also appears vast for EML’s payment and card solutions. With innovation and effective execution, significant growth upside likely remains. There is substantial room left for the company to recover to former highs.

Loss-Making EML Payments Limited (ASX:EML) Expected To Breakeven In The Medium-Term 2024-04-08T01:20:56.000Z

With the business potentially at an important milestone, we thought we'd take a closer look at 
 future prospects. EML Payments Limited provides payment solutions platform in Australia, Europe, and North America. With the latest financial year loss of AU$285m and a trailing-twelve-month loss of AU$167m, the AU$418m market-cap company alleviated its loss by moving closer towards its target of breakeven. The most pressing concern for investors is EML Payments' path to profitability – when will it breakeven? In this article, we will touch on the expectations for the company's growth and when analysts expect it to become profitable.
Consensus from 6 of the Australian Diversified Financial analysts is that EML Payments is on the verge of breakeven. They anticipate the company to incur a final loss in 2024, before generating positive profits of AU$22m in 2025. Therefore, the company is expected to breakeven just over a year from today. How fast will the company have to grow each year in order to reach the breakeven point by 2025? Working backwards from analyst estimates, it turns out that they expect the company to grow 87% year-on-year, on average, which is rather optimistic! Should the business grow at a slower rate, it will become profitable at a later date than expected.
Given this is a high-level overview, we won’t go into details of EML Payments' upcoming projects, but, keep in mind that generally a high forecast growth rate is not unusual for a company that is currently undergoing an investment period.
Before we wrap up, there’s one issue worth mentioning. EML Payments currently has a relatively high level of debt. Typically, debt shouldn’t exceed 40% of your equity, which in EML Payments' case is 55%. Note that a higher debt obligation increases the risk around investing in the loss-making company.
There are too many aspects of EML Payments to cover in one brief article, but the key fundamentals for the company can all be found in one place – 
. We've also put together a list of key factors you should look at:
 
================================================================================

EML Payments Limited (ASX:EML) most popular amongst individual investors who own 45% of the shares, institutions hold 35% 2024-05-06T01:27:07.000Z

To get a sense of who is truly in control of EML Payments Limited (
), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 45% to be precise, is individual investors. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
Institutions, on the other hand, account for 35% of the company's stockholders. Insiders often own a large chunk of younger, smaller, companies while huge companies tend to have institutions as shareholders.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of EML Payments.
Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.
EML Payments already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at EML Payments' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.
EML Payments is not owned by hedge funds. Patrick Haley is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.1% of shares outstanding. Viburnum Funds Pty Ltd. is the second largest shareholder owning 6.5% of common stock, and Wilson Asset Management (International) Pty Ltd. holds about 6.1% of the company stock.
After doing some more digging, we found that the top 15 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.
While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.
Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.
It seems insiders own a significant proportion of EML Payments Limited. Insiders own AU$41m worth of shares in the AU$371m company. This may suggest that the founders still own a lot of shares. You can 
With a 45% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over EML Payments. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.
With an ownership of 6.5%, private equity firms are in a position to play a role in shaping corporate strategy with a focus on value creation. Sometimes we see private equity stick around for the long term, but generally speaking they have a shorter investment horizon and -- as the name suggests -- don't invest in public companies much. After some time they may look to sell and redeploy capital elsewhere.
I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

EML Payments (ASX:EML) shareholders have endured a 76% loss from investing in the stock three years ago 2024-06-15T00:53:24.000Z

It's not possible to invest over long periods without making some bad investments. But you have a problem if you face massive losses more than once in a while. So take a moment to sympathize with the long term shareholders of 
 (
), who have seen the share price tank a massive 76% over a three year period. That would certainly shake our confidence in the decision to own the stock. Furthermore, it's down 28% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders.
So let's have a look and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.
EML Payments isn't currently profitable, so most analysts would look to revenue growth to get an idea of how fast the underlying business is growing. Shareholders of unprofitable companies usually desire strong revenue growth. As you can imagine, fast revenue growth, when maintained, often leads to fast profit growth.
In the last three years, EML Payments saw its revenue grow by 17% per year, compound. That's a pretty good rate of top-line growth. So it's hard to believe the share price decline of 21% per year is due to the revenue. More likely, the market was spooked by the cost of that revenue. This is exactly why investors need to diversify - even when a loss making company grows revenue, it can fail to deliver for shareholders.
You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).
It's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. You can see what analysts are predicting for EML Payments in this 
 
.
It's good to see that EML Payments has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 45% in the last twelve months. Notably the five-year annualised TSR loss of 11% per year compares very unfavourably with the recent share price performance. The long term loss makes us cautious, but the short term TSR gain certainly hints at a brighter future. You could get a better understanding of EML Payments' growth by checking out
