ASX Dividend Stocks To Consider In July 2024

The Australian market has shown robust growth, climbing 3.0% over the past week and achieving a 10% increase over the past 12 months, with earnings projected to grow by 14% annually. In this buoyant environment, dividend stocks that offer consistent payouts and potential for capital appreciation can be particularly attractive to investors seeking both stability and growth.
Below we spotlight a couple of our favorites from our exclusive screener.
 ★★★★☆☆
 Accent Group Limited operates in the retail, distribution, and franchise of lifestyle footwear, as well as apparel and accessories across Australia and New Zealand, with a market capitalization of approximately A$1.22 billion.
 Accent Group Limited generates A$1.40 billion from its multi-channel retail operations focusing on performance and lifestyle footwear.
 6.5%
Accent Group has exhibited a mixed track record with its dividend performance, marked by volatility and unreliable growth over the past decade. While the dividend yield stands at an attractive 6.48%, higher than the Australian market average of 6.29%, concerns arise from its coverage; a payout ratio of 107.2% suggests dividends are not well-supported by earnings, despite being reasonably covered by cash flows (39%). Additionally, recent leadership changes with James Anderson's appointment as CIO could influence future strategic directions impacting financial health and dividend sustainability.
 ★★★★☆☆
 Harvey Norman Holdings Limited operates in integrated retail, franchise, property, and digital system sectors with a market capitalization of approximately A$5.59 billion.
 Harvey Norman Holdings Limited generates revenue from various international retail segments, including A$982.46 million from New Zealand, A$204.83 million from Slovenia and Croatia, A$691.09 million from Singapore and Malaysia, A$237.17 million from non-franchised retail operations, and A$676.83 million from Ireland and Northern Ireland.
 4.5%
Harvey Norman Holdings offers a dividend yield of 4.45%, which is below the top quartile of Australian dividend payers at 6.29%. Despite an unstable track record over the past decade, its dividends are sustainably covered by both earnings and cash flows, with payout ratios of 73.4% and 39.2% respectively. Earnings are expected to grow by 7.62% annually, yet profit margins have declined from last year's 26.6% to 13.4%. The stock is currently trading at a significant discount, valued at 33.5% below its estimated fair value.
 ★★★★☆☆
 Nib Holdings Limited operates as a provider of private health insurance for residents, international students, and visitors in Australia and New Zealand, with a market capitalization of approximately A$3.47 billion.
 Nib Holdings Limited generates revenue through several segments, including Australian Residents Health Insurance at A$2.55 billion, New Zealand Insurance at A$351.90 million, NIB Travel at A$109.10 million, International (Inbound) Health Insurance at A$173.20 million, and Nib Thrive at A$38 million.
 4.2%

Currently trading at a significant discount, nib is valued at 41.5% below estimated fair value, suggesting potential undervaluation despite its mixed dividend reliability.

Harvey Norman Holdings (ASX:HVN) Is Reducing Its Dividend To A$0.12

 (
) dividend is being reduced from last year's payment covering the same period to A$0.12 on the 13th of November. However, the dividend yield of 6.2% is still a decent boost to shareholder returns.
While it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable. Based on the last payment, Harvey Norman Holdings was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.
Over the next year, EPS is forecast to fall by 19.0%. However, if the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio could reach 78%, meaning that most of the company's earnings are being paid out to shareholders.
Although the company has a long dividend history, it has been cut at least once in the last 10 years. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from A$0.08 total annually to A$0.25. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 12% per annum over that time. Despite the rapid growth in the dividend over the past number of years, we have seen the payments go down the past as well, so that makes us cautious.
Given that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. We are encouraged to see that Harvey Norman Holdings has grown earnings per share at 5.4% per year over the past five years. The company is paying a reasonable amount of earnings to shareholders, and is growing earnings at a decent rate so we think it could be a decent dividend stock.
Even though the dividend was cut this year, we think Harvey Norman Holdings has the ability to make consistent payments in the future. The dividend has been at reasonable levels historically, but that hasn't translated into a consistent payment. This looks like it could be a good dividend stock going forward, but we would note that the payout ratio has been at higher levels in the past so it could happen again.
It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. To that end, Harvey Norman Holdings has

Harvey Norman Holdings (ASX:HVN) Is Paying Out Less In Dividends Than Last Year

 (
) has announced that on 13th of November, it will be paying a dividend ofA$0.12, which a reduction from last year's comparable dividend. This means the annual payment is 6.3% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry.
If the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. Prior to this announcement, Harvey Norman Holdings' dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.
EPS is set to fall by 18.4% over the next 12 months. If recent patterns in the dividend continue, we could see the payout ratio reaching 77% in the next 12 months, which is on the higher end of the range we would say is sustainable.
The company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years. The annual payment during the last 10 years was A$0.08 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was A$0.25. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 12% a year over that time. Harvey Norman Holdings has grown distributions at a rapid rate despite cutting the dividend at least once in the past. Companies that cut once often cut again, so we would be cautious about buying this stock solely for the dividend income.
With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share is growing. It's encouraging to see that Harvey Norman Holdings has been growing its earnings per share at 5.4% a year over the past five years. Shareholders are getting plenty of the earnings returned to them, which combined with strong growth makes this quite appealing.
Overall, we think that Harvey Norman Holdings could make a reasonable income stock, even though it did cut the dividend this year. The dividend has been at reasonable levels historically, but that hasn't translated into a consistent payment. The payment isn't stellar, but it could make a decent addition to a dividend portfolio.
It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Case in point: We've spotted

Harvey Norman Holdings Limited (ASX:HVN) insiders have significant skin in the game with 43% ownership

A look at the shareholders of Harvey Norman Holdings Limited (
) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 43% to be precise, is individual insiders. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).
With such a notable stake in the company, insiders would be highly incentivised to make value accretive decisions.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Harvey Norman Holdings.
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
We can see that Harvey Norman Holdings does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Harvey Norman Holdings' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.
We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Harvey Norman Holdings. Our data suggests that Gerald Harvey, who is also the company's Top Key Executive, holds the most number of shares at 36%. When an insider holds a sizeable amount of a company's stock, investors consider it as a positive sign because it suggests that insiders are willing to have their wealth tied up in the future of the company. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 16% and 4.7% of the stock. Additionally, the company's CEO Kay Lesley Page directly holds 1.6% of the total shares outstanding.
A more detailed study of the shareholder registry showed us that 2 of the top shareholders have a considerable amount of ownership in the company, via their 52% stake.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.
It seems insiders own a significant proportion of Harvey Norman Holdings Limited. It has a market capitalization of just AU$4.8b, and insiders have AU$2.1b worth of shares in their own names. That's quite significant. Most would say this shows a good degree of alignment with shareholders, especially in a company of this size. You can 
The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 27% stake in Harvey Norman Holdings. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.
It seems that Private Companies own 18%, of the Harvey Norman Holdings stock. Private companies may be related parties. Sometimes insiders have an interest in a public company through a holding in a private company, rather than in their own capacity as an individual. While it's hard to draw any broad stroke conclusions, it is worth noting as an area for further research.
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Be aware that

Harvey Norman Holdings' (ASX:HVN) Dividend Is Being Reduced To A$0.12

A big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. Prior to this announcement, Harvey Norman Holdings' dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This indicates that a lot of the earnings are being reinvested into the business, with the aim of fueling growth.
Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to fall by 17.4% over the next year. However, if the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio could reach 76%, meaning that most of the company's earnings are being paid out to shareholders.
The company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years. The dividend has gone from an annual total of A$0.085 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of A$0.25. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 11% a year over that time. Dividends have grown rapidly over this time, but with cuts in the past we are not certain that this stock will be a reliable source of income in the future.

The payout ratio looks good, but unfortunately the company's dividend track record isn't stellar. The dividend looks okay, but there have been some issues in the past, so we would be a little bit cautious.

Harvey Norman Holdings Insiders Added AU$80.4m Of Stock To Their Holdings

Multiple insiders secured a larger position in 
 (
) shares over the last 12 months. This is reassuring as this suggests that insiders have increased optimism about the company's prospects.
While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.
In the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Co-Founder Gerald Harvey bought AU$29m worth of shares at a price of AU$3.86 per share. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of AU$3.67. Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important. Generally speaking, it catches our eye when insiders have purchased shares at above current prices, as it suggests they believed the shares were worth buying, even at a higher price.
In the last twelve months Harvey Norman Holdings insiders were buying shares, but not selling. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!
There are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. So if that suits your style you could check each stock one by one or you could take a look at this 
 
Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Harvey Norman Holdings insiders own 43% of the company, currently worth about AU$2.0b based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.
The fact that there have been no Harvey Norman Holdings insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening. Judging from their transactions, and high insider ownership, Harvey Norman Holdings insiders feel good about the company's future. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Harvey Norman Holdings. For example, Harvey Norman Holdings has

It's Unlikely That The CEO Of Harvey Norman Holdings Limited (ASX:HVN) Will See A Huge Pay Rise This Year

In the past three years, shareholders of 
 (
) have seen a loss on their investment. What is concerning is that despite positive EPS growth, the share price has not tracked the trend in fundamentals. These are some of the concerns that shareholders may want to bring up at the next AGM held on 29th of November. Voting on resolutions such as executive remuneration and other matters could also be a way to influence management. Here's our take on why we think shareholders may want to be cautious of approving a raise for the CEO at the moment.
Our data indicates that Harvey Norman Holdings Limited has a market capitalization of AU$4.7b, and total annual CEO compensation was reported as AU$3.7m for the year to June 2023. That's slightly lower by 5.5% over the previous year. We note that the salary of AU$2.12m makes up a sizeable portion of the total compensation received by the CEO.
On comparing similar companies from the 
 with market caps ranging from AU$3.0b to AU$9.7b, we found that the median CEO total compensation was AU$3.7m. This suggests that Harvey Norman Holdings remunerates its CEO largely in line with the industry average. Furthermore, Katie Page directly owns AU$76m worth of shares in the company, implying that they are deeply invested in the company's success.
Speaking on an industry level, nearly 37% of total compensation represents salary, while the remainder of 63% is other remuneration. Harvey Norman Holdings pays out 57% of remuneration in the form of a salary, significantly higher than the industry average. If salary dominates total compensation, it suggests that CEO compensation is leaning less towards the variable component, which is usually linked with performance.
Harvey Norman Holdings Limited has seen its earnings per share (EPS) increase by 3.4% a year over the past three years. Its revenue is down 1.1% over the previous year.
We would prefer it if there was revenue growth, but the modest improvement in EPS is good. These two metrics are moving in different directions, so while it's hard to be confident judging performance, we think the stock is worth watching. Looking ahead, you might want to check 
.
With a three year total loss of 2.0% for the shareholders, Harvey Norman Holdings Limited would certainly have some dissatisfied shareholders. This suggests it would be unwise for the company to pay the CEO too generously.
The fact that shareholders are sitting on a loss on the value of their shares in the past few years is certainly disconcerting. A huge lag in share price growth when earnings have grown may indicate there could be other issues that are affecting the company at the moment that the market is focused on. Shareholders would be keen to know what's holding the stock back when earnings have grown. The upcoming AGM will be a chance for shareholders to question the board on key matters, such as CEO remuneration or any other issues they might have and revisit their investment thesis with regards to the company.
CEO compensation is an important area to keep your eyes on, but we've also need to pay attention to other attributes of the company. We did our research and identified

An Intrinsic Calculation For Harvey Norman Holdings Limited (ASX:HVN) Suggests It's 34% Undervalued

How far off is Harvey Norman Holdings Limited (
) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.
Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the 
.
We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:
 = AU$3.0b
After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.1%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$556m× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.1%– 2.1%) = AU$9.4b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$9.4b÷ ( 1 + 8.1%)
= AU$4.3b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is AU$7.3b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of AU$3.9, the company appears quite undervalued at a 34% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.
The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Harvey Norman Holdings as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.212. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Harvey Norman Holdings, we've put together three important elements you should further research:

Harvey Norman Holdings' (ASX:HVN) five-year earnings growth trails the 14% YoY shareholder returns

The simplest way to invest in stocks is to buy exchange traded funds. But the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the 
 (ASX:HVN) share price is up 30% in the last five years, slightly above the market return. Zooming in, the stock is actually down 1.9% in the last year.
The past week has proven to be lucrative for Harvey Norman Holdings investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's five-year performance.
To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.
During five years of share price growth, Harvey Norman Holdings achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 5.4% per year. That makes the EPS growth particularly close to the yearly share price growth of 5%. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.
The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).
We consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..
As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Harvey Norman Holdings, it has a TSR of 88% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!
Harvey Norman Holdings shareholders gained a total return of 4.8% during the year. Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. On the bright side, the longer term returns (running at about 14% a year, over half a decade) look better. It's quite possible the business continues to execute with prowess, even as the share price gains are slowing. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

Harvey Norman Holdings (ASX:HVN) Hasn't Managed To Accelerate Its Returns

To find a multi-bagger stock, what are the underlying trends we should look for in a business? In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. So, when we ran our eye over 
 (
) trend of ROCE, we liked what we saw.
For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Harvey Norman Holdings, this is the formula:
0.11 = AU$792m ÷ (AU$7.7b - AU$739m) 
.
So, 
 By itself that's a normal return on capital and it's in line with the industry's average returns of 11%.
In the above chart we have measured Harvey Norman Holdings' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our

While the current returns on capital are decent, they haven't changed much. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 11% and the business has deployed 85% more capital into its operations. Since 11% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.
The main thing to remember is that Harvey Norman Holdings has proven its ability to continually reinvest at respectable rates of return. And since the stock has risen strongly over the last five years, it appears the market might expect this trend to continue. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we still believe the stock deserves further research.

Harvey Norman Holdings (ASX:HVN) Is Reducing Its Dividend To A$0.10

 (
) dividend is being reduced from last year's payment covering the same period to A$0.10 on the 1st of May. This means the annual payment is 4.0% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry.
While the dividend yield is important for income investors, it is also important to consider any large share price moves, as this will generally outweigh any gains from distributions. Investors will be pleased to see that Harvey Norman Holdings' stock price has increased by 32% in the last 3 months, which is good for shareholders and can also explain a decrease in the dividend yield.
Impressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. The last payment made up 73% of earnings, but cash flows were much higher. In general, cash flows are more important than earnings, so we are comfortable that the dividend will be sustainable going forward, especially with so much cash left over for reinvestment.
Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 27.3% over the next year. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 62% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.
The company has a long dividend track record, but it doesn't look great with cuts in the past. The annual payment during the last 10 years was A$0.09 in 2014, and the most recent fiscal year payment was A$0.20. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 8.3% per annum over that time. A reasonable rate of dividend growth is good to see, but we're wary that the dividend history is not as solid as we'd like, having been cut at least once.
Given that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. In the last five years, Harvey Norman Holdings' earnings per share has shrunk at approximately 2.7% per annum. If earnings continue declining, the company may have to make the difficult choice of reducing the dividend or even stopping it completely - the opposite of dividend growth. Earnings are forecast to grow over the next 12 months and if that happens we could still be a little bit cautious until it becomes a pattern.
In summary, dividends being cut isn't ideal, however it can bring the payment into a more sustainable range. The company is generating plenty of cash, which could maintain the dividend for a while, but the track record hasn't been great. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.
Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For example, we've picked out 
 that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock. If you are a dividend investor, you might also want to look at our

Owning 43% in Harvey Norman Holdings Limited (ASX:HVN) means that insiders are heavily invested in the company's future

A look at the shareholders of Harvey Norman Holdings Limited (ASX:HVN) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are individual insiders with 43% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
With such a notable stake in the company, insiders would be highly incentivised to make value accretive decisions.
Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Harvey Norman Holdings.
Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.
We can see that Harvey Norman Holdings does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Harvey Norman Holdings, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.
Harvey Norman Holdings is not owned by hedge funds. From our data, we infer that the largest shareholder is Gerald Harvey (who also holds the title of Top Key Executive) with 36% of shares outstanding. Its usually considered a good sign when insiders own a significant number of shares in the company, and in this case, we're glad to see a company insider play the role of a key stakeholder. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 16% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.7% by the third-largest shareholder. Additionally, the company's CEO Kay Lesley Page directly holds 1.6% of the total shares outstanding.
A more detailed study of the shareholder registry showed us that 2 of the top shareholders have a considerable amount of ownership in the company, via their 52% stake.
While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
Our information suggests that insiders maintain a significant holding in Harvey Norman Holdings Limited. Insiders own AU$2.6b worth of shares in the AU$6.1b company. That's quite meaningful. Most would be pleased to see the board is investing alongside them. You may wish to access this free chart showing recent trading by insiders.
The general public-- including retail investors -- own 26% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.
We can see that Private Companies own 18%, of the shares on issue. Private companies may be related parties. Sometimes insiders have an interest in a public company through a holding in a private company, rather than in their own capacity as an individual. While it's hard to draw any broad stroke conclusions, it is worth noting as an area for further research.
I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Be aware that Harvey Norman Holdings is showing

Do Its Financials Have Any Role To Play In Driving Harvey Norman Holdings Limited's (ASX:HVN) Stock Up Recently?

Harvey Norman Holdings (ASX:HVN) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 19% over the last three months. As most would know, fundamentals are what usually guide market price movements over the long-term, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. Particularly, we will be paying attention to 
 ROE today.
ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Harvey Norman Holdings is:
8.4% = AU$380m ÷ AU$4.5b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).
The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every A$1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn A$0.08 in profit.
So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or "retains" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
When you first look at it, Harvey Norman Holdings' ROE doesn't look that attractive. However, its ROE is similar to the industry average of 8.4%, so we won't completely dismiss the company. On the other hand, Harvey Norman Holdings reported a moderate 7.9% net income growth over the past five years. Given the slightly low ROE, it is likely that there could be some other aspects that are driving this growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.
We then performed a comparison between Harvey Norman Holdings' net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 7.9% in the same 5-year period.
Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is HVN fairly valued? This
 has everything you need to know.
The high three-year median payout ratio of 56% (or a retention ratio of 44%) for Harvey Norman Holdings suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of its income to its shareholders.
Additionally, Harvey Norman Holdings has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 75% over the next three years. Still, forecasts suggest that Harvey Norman Holdings' future ROE will rise to 11% even though the the company's payout ratio is expected to rise. We presume that there could some other characteristics of the business that could be driving the anticipated growth in the company's ROE.
In total, it does look like Harvey Norman Holdings has some positive aspects to its business. That is, quite an impressive growth in earnings. However, the low profit retention means that the company's earnings growth could have been higher, had it been reinvesting a higher portion of its profits. The latest industry analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to maintain its current growth rate. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?
