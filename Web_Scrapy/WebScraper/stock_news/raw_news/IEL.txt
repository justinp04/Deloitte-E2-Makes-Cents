Returns On Capital At IDP Education (ASX:IEL) Paint A Concerning Picture

If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing 
 on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's 
 of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So while 
 (
) has a high ROCE right now, lets see what we can decipher from how returns are changing.
For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for IDP Education, this is the formula:
0.23 = AU$203m รท (AU$1.1b - AU$260m) 
.
So, 
 That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 8.6% earned by companies in a similar industry.
In the above chart we have measured IDP Education's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our

On the surface, the trend of ROCE at IDP Education doesn't inspire confidence. To be more specific, while the ROCE is still high, it's fallen from 44% where it was five years ago. Although, given both revenue and the amount of assets employed in the business have increased, it could suggest the company is investing in growth, and the extra capital has led to a short-term reduction in ROCE. And if the increased capital generates additional returns, the business, and thus shareholders, will benefit in the long run.
On a side note, IDP Education has done well to pay down its current liabilities to 23% of total assets. That could partly explain why the ROCE has dropped. What's more, this can reduce some aspects of risk to the business because now the company's suppliers or short-term creditors are funding less of its operations. Some would claim this reduces the business' efficiency at generating ROCE since it is now funding more of the operations with its own money.
Even though returns on capital have fallen in the short term, we find it promising that revenue and capital employed have both increased for IDP Education. And the stock has done incredibly well with a 155% return over the last five years, so long term investors are no doubt ecstatic with that result. So should these growth trends continue, we'd be optimistic on the stock going forward.
