Returns On Capital At IDP Education (ASX:IEL) Paint A Concerning Picture 2023-08-04T23:15:24.000Z

If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing 
 on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's 
 of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So while 
 (
) has a high ROCE right now, lets see what we can decipher from how returns are changing.
For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for IDP Education, this is the formula:
0.23 = AU$203m ÷ (AU$1.1b - AU$260m) 
.
So, 
 That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 8.6% earned by companies in a similar industry.
In the above chart we have measured IDP Education's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our 
 
.
On the surface, the trend of ROCE at IDP Education doesn't inspire confidence. To be more specific, while the ROCE is still high, it's fallen from 44% where it was five years ago. Although, given both revenue and the amount of assets employed in the business have increased, it could suggest the company is investing in growth, and the extra capital has led to a short-term reduction in ROCE. And if the increased capital generates additional returns, the business, and thus shareholders, will benefit in the long run.
On a side note, IDP Education has done well to pay down its current liabilities to 23% of total assets. That could partly explain why the ROCE has dropped. What's more, this can reduce some aspects of risk to the business because now the company's suppliers or short-term creditors are funding less of its operations. Some would claim this reduces the business' efficiency at generating ROCE since it is now funding more of the operations with its own money.
Even though returns on capital have fallen in the short term, we find it promising that revenue and capital employed have both increased for IDP Education. And the stock has done incredibly well with a 155% return over the last five years, so long term investors are no doubt ecstatic with that result. So should these growth trends continue, we'd be optimistic on the stock going forward.

Could The Market Be Wrong About IDP Education Limited (ASX:IEL) Given Its Attractive Financial Prospects? 2023-08-19T00:03:11.000Z

With its stock down 16% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard IDP Education (ASX:IEL). However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Specifically, we decided to study 
 ROE in this article.
Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.
The 
 is:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for IDP Education is:
27% = AU$134m ÷ AU$497m (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).
The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each A$1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made A$0.27 in profit.
So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or "retains", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
To begin with, IDP Education has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 7.3% which is quite remarkable. This likely paved the way for the modest 13% net income growth seen by IDP Education over the past five years.
Next, on comparing IDP Education's net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 12% over the last few years.
Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for IEL? You can find out in
The high three-year median payout ratio of 63% (or a retention ratio of 37%) for IDP Education suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of its income to its shareholders.
Besides, IDP Education has been paying dividends over a period of seven years. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 71% of its profits over the next three years. Still, forecasts suggest that IDP Education's future ROE will rise to 36% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.
On the whole, we feel that IDP Education's performance has been quite good. Especially the high ROE, Which has contributed to the impressive growth seen in earnings. Despite the company reinvesting only a small portion of its profits, it still has managed to grow its earnings so that is appreciable. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

IDP Education (ASX:IEL) Is Increasing Its Dividend To A$0.20 2023-08-30T20:12:17.000Z

 (
) will increase its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 28th of September to A$0.20. This makes the dividend yield about the same as the industry average at 1.6%.
We aren't too impressed by dividend yields unless they can be sustained over time. Prior to this announcement, IDP Education was paying out 77% of earnings and more than 75% of free cash flows. This indicates that the company is more focused on returning cash to shareholders than growing the business, but we don't think that there are necessarily signs that the dividend might be unsustainable.
Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 77.3% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along the course it has been charting recently, our estimates show the payout ratio being 48% which brings it into quite a comfortable range.
Even in its relatively short history, the company has reduced the dividend at least once. Due to this, we are a little bit cautious about the dividend consistency over a full economic cycle. Since 2016, the annual payment back then was A$0.055, compared to the most recent full-year payment of A$0.41. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 33% per annum over that time. Dividends have grown rapidly over this time, but with cuts in the past we are not certain that this stock will be a reliable source of income in the future.
With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share is growing. It's encouraging to see that IDP Education has been growing its earnings per share at 21% a year over the past five years. Fast growing earnings are great, but this can rarely be sustained without some reinvestment into the business, which IDP Education hasn't been doing.
Overall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think IDP Education will make a great income stock. In general, the distributions are a little bit higher than we would like, but we can't ignore the fact the quickly growing earnings gives this stock great potential in the future. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.
It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Earnings growth generally bodes well for the future value of company dividend payments. See if the 15 IDP Education analysts we track are forecasting continued growth with our

Income Investors Should Know That IDP Education Limited (ASX:IEL) Goes Ex-Dividend Soon 2023-08-31T20:19:36.000Z

Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see 
 (
) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 3 days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Thus, you can purchase IDP Education's shares before the 4th of September in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 28th of September.
The company's next dividend payment will be AU$0.20 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed AU$0.41 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, IDP Education stock has a trailing yield of around 1.7% on the current share price of A$24.63. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to investigate whether IDP Education can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow.
Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. It paid out 77% of its earnings as dividends last year, which is not unreasonable, but limits reinvestment in the business and leaves the dividend vulnerable to a business downturn. We'd be concerned if earnings began to decline. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Dividends consumed 73% of the company's free cash flow last year, which is within a normal range for most dividend-paying organisations.
It's positive to see that IDP Education's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.
Click 
Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. That's why it's comforting to see IDP Education's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 21% per annum for the past five years. Earnings per share are growing at a rapid rate, yet the company is paying out more than three-quarters of its earnings.
Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the last seven years, IDP Education has lifted its dividend by approximately 33% a year on average. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years.
Is IDP Education worth buying for its dividend? It's good to see earnings are growing, since all of the best dividend stocks grow their earnings meaningfully over the long run. However, we'd also note that IDP Education is paying out more than half of its earnings and cash flow as profits, which could limit the dividend growth if earnings growth slows. In summary, while it has some positive characteristics, we're not inclined to race out and buy IDP Education today.

Estimating The Intrinsic Value Of IDP Education Limited (ASX:IEL) 2023-10-15T23:49:06.000Z

Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of IDP Education Limited (
) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.
We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the 
 may be something of interest to you.
We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:
 = AU$2.4b
The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.1%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$388m× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.1%– 2.0%) = AU$9.7b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$9.7b÷ ( 1 + 6.1%)
= AU$5.3b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is AU$7.7b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of AU$22.5, the company appears about fair value at a 19% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.
The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at IDP Education as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.820. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For IDP Education, we've compiled three relevant elements you should further examine:

We Ran A Stock Scan For Earnings Growth And IDP Education (ASX:IEL) Passed With Ease 2023-10-30T03:50:11.000Z

The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.
In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like 
 (
), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.
The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. It certainly is nice to see that IDP Education has managed to grow EPS by 27% per year over three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away satisfied.
Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. The good news is that IDP Education is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 2.4 percentage points to 22%, over the last year. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.
In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.

It's said that there's no smoke without fire. For investors, insider buying is often the smoke that indicates which stocks could set the market alight. That's because insider buying often indicates that those closest to the company have confidence that the share price will perform well. However, insiders are sometimes wrong, and we don't know the exact thinking behind their acquisitions.
Not only did IDP Education insiders refrain from selling stock during the year, but they also spent AU$132k buying it. This is a good look for the company as it paints an optimistic picture for the future.
It's commendable to see that insiders have been buying shares in IDP Education, but there is more evidence of shareholder friendly management. Specifically, the CEO is paid quite reasonably for a company of this size. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to IDP Education, with market caps between AU$3.2b and AU$10b, is around AU$3.5m.
IDP Education's CEO took home a total compensation package of AU$1.6m in the year prior to June 2023. First impressions seem to indicate a compensation policy that is favourable to shareholders. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when it's reasonable, that gives a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.
For growth investors, IDP Education's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. And that's not the only positive either. We have both insider buying and reasonable and remuneration to consider. All in all, this stock is worth the time to delve deeper into the details.

At AU$23.51, Is IDP Education Limited (ASX:IEL) Worth Looking At Closely? 2023-11-13T05:56:04.000Z

IDP Education Limited (
), is not the largest company out there, but it saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the ASX. With many analysts covering the mid-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s examine IDP Education’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity.
According to my valuation model, IDP Education seems to be fairly priced at around 14% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy IDP Education today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth A$27.30, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since IDP Education’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.
Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. IDP Education's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 71%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.
 IEL’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?
 If you’ve been keeping an eye on IEL, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

Institutional investors may adopt severe steps after IDP Education Limited's (ASX:IEL) latest 7.2% drop adds to a year losses 2023-11-27T21:47:01.000Z

A look at the shareholders of IDP Education Limited (
) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 71% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
And institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's share price fell by 7.2% last week. This set of investors may especially be concerned about the current loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 25% for shareholders. Often called “market movers", institutions wield significant power in influencing the price dynamics of any stock. As a result, if the decline continues, institutional investors may be pressured to sell IDP Education which might hurt individual investors.
Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of IDP Education, beginning with the chart below.
Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.
We can see that IDP Education does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at IDP Education's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.
Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. IDP Education is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that Bangarra Group is the largest shareholder with 10% of shares outstanding. The second and third largest shareholders are Challenger Limited and State Street Global Advisors, Inc., with an equal amount of shares to their name at 6.3%.
We also observed that the top 9 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.
I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.
Our information suggests that IDP Education Limited insiders own under 1% of the company. It's a big company, so even a small proportional interest can create alignment between the board and shareholders. In this case insiders own AU$6.5m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking 
The general public-- including retail investors -- own 29% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

Investing in IDP Education (ASX:IEL) five years ago would have delivered you a 114% gain 2023-12-29T00:09:27.000Z

When you buy shares in a company, it's worth keeping in mind the possibility that it could fail, and you could lose your money. But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. Long term 
 (ASX:IEL) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 104% in five years. Then again, the 8.3% share price decline hasn't been so fun for shareholders.
So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.
While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).
Over half a decade, IDP Education managed to grow its earnings per share at 21% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 15% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.
The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).
We like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. This 
 interactive report on IDP Education's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.
It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for IDP Education the TSR over the last 5 years was 114%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!
IDP Education shareholders are down 25% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 12%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 16%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. Investors who like to make money usually check up on insider purchases, such as the price paid, and total amount bought.

IDP Education (ASX:IEL) Could Be Struggling To Allocate Capital 2024-01-12T00:27:09.000Z

Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics. Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing 
 on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing 
 of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Having said that, while the ROCE is currently high for 
 (ASX:IEL), we aren't jumping out of our chairs because returns are decreasing.
If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for IDP Education, this is the formula:
0.25 = AU$221m ÷ (AU$1.2b - AU$351m) 
.
Therefore, 
 In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Consumer Services industry average of 7.2%.
In the above chart we have measured IDP Education's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering IDP Education here for 
On the surface, the trend of ROCE at IDP Education doesn't inspire confidence. Historically returns on capital were even higher at 44%, but they have dropped over the last five years. However, given capital employed and revenue have both increased it appears that the business is currently pursuing growth, at the consequence of short term returns. If these investments prove successful, this can bode very well for long term stock performance.
On a related note, IDP Education has decreased its current liabilities to 28% of total assets. So we could link some of this to the decrease in ROCE. Effectively this means their suppliers or short-term creditors are funding less of the business, which reduces some elements of risk. Since the business is basically funding more of its operations with it's own money, you could argue this has made the business less efficient at generating ROCE.
Even though returns on capital have fallen in the short term, we find it promising that revenue and capital employed have both increased for IDP Education. And the stock has followed suit returning a meaningful 94% to shareholders over the last five years. So while the underlying trends could already be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.
IDP Education could be trading at an attractive price in other respects, so you might find our

IDP Education Limited's (ASX:IEL) Stock Has Been Sliding But Fundamentals Look Strong: Is The Market Wrong? 2024-01-26T02:52:03.000Z

With its stock down 9.6% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard IDP Education (ASX:IEL). However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. In this article, we decided to focus on 
 ROE.
Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for IDP Education is:
29% = AU$149m ÷ AU$517m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).
The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every A$1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn A$0.29 in profit.
We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or "retain", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.
First thing first, we like that IDP Education has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 4.9% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. This probably laid the groundwork for IDP Education's moderate 18% net income growth seen over the past five years.
As a next step, we compared IDP Education's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 18% in the same period.
The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for IEL? You can find out in
IDP Education has a significant three-year median payout ratio of 63%, meaning that it is left with only 37% to reinvest into its business. This implies that the company has been able to achieve decent earnings growth despite returning most of its profits to shareholders.
Moreover, IDP Education is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of seven years of paying a dividend. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 75%. Regardless, the future ROE for IDP Education is predicted to rise to 37% despite there being not much change expected in its payout ratio.
On the whole, we feel that IDP Education's performance has been quite good. In particular, its high ROE is quite noteworthy and also the probable explanation behind its considerable earnings growth. Yet, the company is retaining a small portion of its profits. Which means that the company has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's not too bad. We also studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that the company's earnings growth is expected be similar to its current growth rate. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

IDP Education (ASX:IEL) Will Pay A Larger Dividend Than Last Year At A$0.25 2024-02-21T22:55:30.000Z

The board of 
 (
) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend by 19% on the 27th of March to A$0.25, up from last year's comparable payment of A$0.21. The payment will take the dividend yield to 2.1%, which is in line with the average for the industry.
Unless the payments are sustainable, the dividend yield doesn't mean too much. The last dividend made up a very large portion of earnings and also represented 93% of free cash flows. This is usually an indication that the focus of the company is returning cash to shareholders rather than reinvesting it for growth.
The next year is set to see EPS grow by 56.2%. Assuming the dividend continues along the course it has been charting recently, our estimates show the payout ratio being 55% which brings it into quite a comfortable range.
Looking back, IDP Education's dividend hasn't been particularly consistent. If the company cuts once, it definitely isn't argument against the possibility of it cutting in the future. Since 2017, the annual payment back then was A$0.055, compared to the most recent full-year payment of A$0.41. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 33% over that duration. IDP Education has grown distributions at a rapid rate despite cutting the dividend at least once in the past. Companies that cut once often cut again, so we would be cautious about buying this stock solely for the dividend income.
With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share is growing, which could point to a growing dividend in the future. We are encouraged to see that IDP Education has grown earnings per share at 19% per year over the past five years. The payout ratio is very much on the higher end, which could mean that the growth rate will slow down in the future, and that could flow through to the dividend as well.
Overall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think IDP Education will make a great income stock. Strong earnings growth means IDP Education has the potential to be a good dividend stock in the future, despite the current payments being at elevated levels. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.
It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Earnings growth generally bodes well for the future value of company dividend payments. See if the 15 IDP Education analysts we track are forecasting continued growth with our

Should Income Investors Look At IDP Education Limited (ASX:IEL) Before Its Ex-Dividend? 2024-03-02T23:11:13.000Z

Some investors rely on dividends for growing their wealth, and if you're one of those dividend sleuths, you might be intrigued to know that 
 (
) is about to go ex-dividend in just four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Accordingly, IDP Education investors that purchase the stock on or after the 7th of March will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 27th of March.
The company's upcoming dividend is AU$0.25 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of AU$0.41 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, IDP Education has a trailing yield of 2.1% on the current stock price of AU$19.22. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing.
If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. It paid out 77% of its earnings as dividends last year, which is not unreasonable, but limits reinvestment in the business and leaves the dividend vulnerable to a business downturn. It could become a concern if earnings started to decline. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether IDP Education generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. It paid out 93% of its free cash flow in the form of dividends last year, which is outside the comfort zone for most businesses. Companies usually need cash more than they need earnings - expenses don't pay themselves - so it's not great to see it paying out so much of its cash flow.
While IDP Education's dividends were covered by the company's reported profits, cash is somewhat more important, so it's not great to see that the company didn't generate enough cash to pay its dividend. Cash is king, as they say, and were IDP Education to repeatedly pay dividends that aren't well covered by cashflow, we would consider this a warning sign.
Click 
Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. It's encouraging to see IDP Education has grown its earnings rapidly, up 23% a year for the past five years. Earnings have been growing quickly, but we're concerned dividend payments consumed most of the company's cash flow over the past year.
Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the past eight years, IDP Education has increased its dividend at approximately 29% a year on average. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.
Is IDP Education an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Earnings per share growth is a positive, and the company's payout ratio looks normal. However, we note IDP Education paid out a much higher percentage of its free cash flow, which makes us uncomfortable. To summarise, IDP Education looks okay on this analysis, although it doesn't appear a stand-out opportunity.

IDP Education Limited (ASX:IEL) Shares Could Be 34% Below Their Intrinsic Value Estimate 2024-03-24T22:16:14.000Z

Does the March share price for IDP Education Limited (
) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.
We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the 
 may be something of interest to you.
We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:
 = AU$2.2b
The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.3%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$414m× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.3%– 2.2%) = AU$10b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$10b÷ ( 1 + 6.3%)
= AU$5.6b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is AU$7.8b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of AU$18.5, the company appears quite undervalued at a 34% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.
We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at IDP Education as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.889. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For IDP Education, we've compiled three important items you should consider:

At AU$16.44, Is IDP Education Limited (ASX:IEL) Worth Looking At Closely? 2024-04-22T01:01:58.000Z

While IDP Education Limited (
) might not have the largest market cap around , it saw significant share price movement during recent months on the ASX, rising to highs of AU$22.06 and falling to the lows of AU$16.03. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether IDP Education's current trading price of AU$16.44 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at IDP Education’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.
Great news for investors – IDP Education is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to our valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is A$24.63, but it is currently trading at AU$16.44 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because IDP Education’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.
Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. IDP Education's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 52%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.
 Since IEL is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.
 If you’ve been keeping an eye on IEL for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy IEL. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed buy.

The one-year underlying earnings growth at IDP Education (ASX:IEL) is promising, but the shareholders are still in the red over that time 2024-06-06T01:23:26.000Z

Investors can approximate the average market return by buying an index fund. Active investors aim to buy stocks that vastly outperform the market - but in the process, they risk under-performance. That downside risk was realized by 
 (
) shareholders over the last year, as the share price declined 32%. That's disappointing when you consider the market returned 13%. To make matters worse, the returns over three years have also been really disappointing (the share price is 30% lower than three years ago). Furthermore, it's down 16% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders.
Given the past week has been tough on shareholders, let's investigate the fundamentals and see what we can learn.
While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.
Even though the IDP Education share price is down over the year, its EPS actually improved. It could be that the share price was previously over-hyped.
It's fair to say that the share price does not seem to be reflecting the EPS growth. So it's well worth checking out some other metrics, too.
IDP Education's revenue is actually up 18% over the last year. Since the fundamental metrics don't readily explain the share price drop, there might be an opportunity if the market has overreacted.
You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).
It's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. This 
 
 should help you form a view on IDP Education
IDP Education shareholders are down 30% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 13%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 1.8% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. Investors who like to make money usually check up on insider purchases, such as the price paid, and total amount bought.

IDP Education (ASX:IEL) Is Reinvesting At Lower Rates Of Return 2024-06-22T23:42:26.000Z

If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing 
 on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing 
 of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So when we looked at 
 (
), they do have a high ROCE, but we weren't exactly elated from how returns are trending.
If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for IDP Education:
0.25 = AU$246m ÷ (AU$1.3b - AU$289m) 
.
So, 
 In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Consumer Services industry average of 7.5%.
Above you can see how the current ROCE for IDP Education compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can 
 for 
When we looked at the ROCE trend at IDP Education, we didn't gain much confidence. While it's comforting that the ROCE is high, five years ago it was 39%. Although, given both revenue and the amount of assets employed in the business have increased, it could suggest the company is investing in growth, and the extra capital has led to a short-term reduction in ROCE. If these investments prove successful, this can bode very well for long term stock performance.
On a related note, IDP Education has decreased its current liabilities to 23% of total assets. That could partly explain why the ROCE has dropped. What's more, this can reduce some aspects of risk to the business because now the company's suppliers or short-term creditors are funding less of its operations. Since the business is basically funding more of its operations with it's own money, you could argue this has made the business less efficient at generating ROCE.
In summary, despite lower returns in the short term, we're encouraged to see that IDP Education is reinvesting for growth and has higher sales as a result. These growth trends haven't led to growth returns though, since the stock has fallen 13% over the last five years. As a result, we'd recommend researching this stock further to uncover what other fundamentals of the business can show us.

IDP Education Limited (ASX:IEL) Stock Has Shown Weakness Lately But Financials Look Strong: Should Prospective Shareholders Make The Leap? 2024-07-12T05:01:56.000Z

IDP Education (ASX:IEL) has had a rough three months with its share price down 13%. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Specifically, we decided to study 
 ROE in this article.
ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.
The 
 is:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for IDP Education is:
30% = AU$164m ÷ AU$550m (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).
The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every A$1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of A$0.30.
Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or "retain", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
First thing first, we like that IDP Education has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 6.2% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. So, the substantial 22% net income growth seen by IDP Education over the past five years isn't overly surprising.
Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that IDP Education's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 14% in the same period, which is great to see.
Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is IEL fairly valued? This
 has everything you need to know.
IDP Education has a significant three-year median payout ratio of 72%, meaning the company only retains 28% of its income. This implies that the company has been able to achieve high earnings growth despite returning most of its profits to shareholders.
Besides, IDP Education has been paying dividends over a period of eight years. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 71%. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 32%.
Overall, we are quite pleased with IDP Education's performance. We are particularly impressed by the considerable earnings growth posted by the company, which was likely backed by its high ROE. While the company is paying out most of its earnings as dividends, it has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's probably a good sign. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

Returns On Capital At IDP Education (ASX:IEL) Paint A Concerning Picture 2023-08-04T23:15:24.000Z

If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing 
 on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's 
 of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So while 
 (
) has a high ROCE right now, lets see what we can decipher from how returns are changing.
For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for IDP Education, this is the formula:
0.23 = AU$203m ÷ (AU$1.1b - AU$260m) 
.
So, 
 That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 8.6% earned by companies in a similar industry.
In the above chart we have measured IDP Education's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our 
 
.
On the surface, the trend of ROCE at IDP Education doesn't inspire confidence. To be more specific, while the ROCE is still high, it's fallen from 44% where it was five years ago. Although, given both revenue and the amount of assets employed in the business have increased, it could suggest the company is investing in growth, and the extra capital has led to a short-term reduction in ROCE. And if the increased capital generates additional returns, the business, and thus shareholders, will benefit in the long run.
On a side note, IDP Education has done well to pay down its current liabilities to 23% of total assets. That could partly explain why the ROCE has dropped. What's more, this can reduce some aspects of risk to the business because now the company's suppliers or short-term creditors are funding less of its operations. Some would claim this reduces the business' efficiency at generating ROCE since it is now funding more of the operations with its own money.
Even though returns on capital have fallen in the short term, we find it promising that revenue and capital employed have both increased for IDP Education. And the stock has done incredibly well with a 155% return over the last five years, so long term investors are no doubt ecstatic with that result. So should these growth trends continue, we'd be optimistic on the stock going forward.

Could The Market Be Wrong About IDP Education Limited (ASX:IEL) Given Its Attractive Financial Prospects? 2023-08-19T00:03:11.000Z

With its stock down 16% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard IDP Education (ASX:IEL). However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Specifically, we decided to study 
 ROE in this article.
Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.
The 
 is:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for IDP Education is:
27% = AU$134m ÷ AU$497m (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).
The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each A$1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made A$0.27 in profit.
So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or "retains", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
To begin with, IDP Education has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 7.3% which is quite remarkable. This likely paved the way for the modest 13% net income growth seen by IDP Education over the past five years.
Next, on comparing IDP Education's net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 12% over the last few years.
Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for IEL? You can find out in
The high three-year median payout ratio of 63% (or a retention ratio of 37%) for IDP Education suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of its income to its shareholders.
Besides, IDP Education has been paying dividends over a period of seven years. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 71% of its profits over the next three years. Still, forecasts suggest that IDP Education's future ROE will rise to 36% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.
On the whole, we feel that IDP Education's performance has been quite good. Especially the high ROE, Which has contributed to the impressive growth seen in earnings. Despite the company reinvesting only a small portion of its profits, it still has managed to grow its earnings so that is appreciable. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

IDP Education (ASX:IEL) Is Increasing Its Dividend To A$0.20 2023-08-30T20:12:17.000Z

 (
) will increase its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 28th of September to A$0.20. This makes the dividend yield about the same as the industry average at 1.6%.
We aren't too impressed by dividend yields unless they can be sustained over time. Prior to this announcement, IDP Education was paying out 77% of earnings and more than 75% of free cash flows. This indicates that the company is more focused on returning cash to shareholders than growing the business, but we don't think that there are necessarily signs that the dividend might be unsustainable.
Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 77.3% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along the course it has been charting recently, our estimates show the payout ratio being 48% which brings it into quite a comfortable range.
Even in its relatively short history, the company has reduced the dividend at least once. Due to this, we are a little bit cautious about the dividend consistency over a full economic cycle. Since 2016, the annual payment back then was A$0.055, compared to the most recent full-year payment of A$0.41. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 33% per annum over that time. Dividends have grown rapidly over this time, but with cuts in the past we are not certain that this stock will be a reliable source of income in the future.
With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share is growing. It's encouraging to see that IDP Education has been growing its earnings per share at 21% a year over the past five years. Fast growing earnings are great, but this can rarely be sustained without some reinvestment into the business, which IDP Education hasn't been doing.
Overall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think IDP Education will make a great income stock. In general, the distributions are a little bit higher than we would like, but we can't ignore the fact the quickly growing earnings gives this stock great potential in the future. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.
It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Earnings growth generally bodes well for the future value of company dividend payments. See if the 15 IDP Education analysts we track are forecasting continued growth with our

Income Investors Should Know That IDP Education Limited (ASX:IEL) Goes Ex-Dividend Soon 2023-08-31T20:19:36.000Z

Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see 
 (
) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 3 days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Thus, you can purchase IDP Education's shares before the 4th of September in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 28th of September.
The company's next dividend payment will be AU$0.20 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed AU$0.41 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, IDP Education stock has a trailing yield of around 1.7% on the current share price of A$24.63. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to investigate whether IDP Education can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow.
Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. It paid out 77% of its earnings as dividends last year, which is not unreasonable, but limits reinvestment in the business and leaves the dividend vulnerable to a business downturn. We'd be concerned if earnings began to decline. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Dividends consumed 73% of the company's free cash flow last year, which is within a normal range for most dividend-paying organisations.
It's positive to see that IDP Education's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.
Click 
Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. That's why it's comforting to see IDP Education's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 21% per annum for the past five years. Earnings per share are growing at a rapid rate, yet the company is paying out more than three-quarters of its earnings.
Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the last seven years, IDP Education has lifted its dividend by approximately 33% a year on average. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years.
Is IDP Education worth buying for its dividend? It's good to see earnings are growing, since all of the best dividend stocks grow their earnings meaningfully over the long run. However, we'd also note that IDP Education is paying out more than half of its earnings and cash flow as profits, which could limit the dividend growth if earnings growth slows. In summary, while it has some positive characteristics, we're not inclined to race out and buy IDP Education today.

Estimating The Intrinsic Value Of IDP Education Limited (ASX:IEL) 2023-10-15T23:49:06.000Z

Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of IDP Education Limited (
) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.
We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the 
 may be something of interest to you.
We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:
 = AU$2.4b
The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.1%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$388m× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.1%– 2.0%) = AU$9.7b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$9.7b÷ ( 1 + 6.1%)
= AU$5.3b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is AU$7.7b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of AU$22.5, the company appears about fair value at a 19% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.
The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at IDP Education as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.820. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For IDP Education, we've compiled three relevant elements you should further examine:

We Ran A Stock Scan For Earnings Growth And IDP Education (ASX:IEL) Passed With Ease 2023-10-30T03:50:11.000Z

The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.
In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like 
 (
), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.
The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. It certainly is nice to see that IDP Education has managed to grow EPS by 27% per year over three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away satisfied.
Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. The good news is that IDP Education is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 2.4 percentage points to 22%, over the last year. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.
In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.

It's said that there's no smoke without fire. For investors, insider buying is often the smoke that indicates which stocks could set the market alight. That's because insider buying often indicates that those closest to the company have confidence that the share price will perform well. However, insiders are sometimes wrong, and we don't know the exact thinking behind their acquisitions.
Not only did IDP Education insiders refrain from selling stock during the year, but they also spent AU$132k buying it. This is a good look for the company as it paints an optimistic picture for the future.
It's commendable to see that insiders have been buying shares in IDP Education, but there is more evidence of shareholder friendly management. Specifically, the CEO is paid quite reasonably for a company of this size. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to IDP Education, with market caps between AU$3.2b and AU$10b, is around AU$3.5m.
IDP Education's CEO took home a total compensation package of AU$1.6m in the year prior to June 2023. First impressions seem to indicate a compensation policy that is favourable to shareholders. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when it's reasonable, that gives a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.
For growth investors, IDP Education's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. And that's not the only positive either. We have both insider buying and reasonable and remuneration to consider. All in all, this stock is worth the time to delve deeper into the details.

At AU$23.51, Is IDP Education Limited (ASX:IEL) Worth Looking At Closely? 2023-11-13T05:56:04.000Z

IDP Education Limited (
), is not the largest company out there, but it saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the ASX. With many analysts covering the mid-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s examine IDP Education’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity.
According to my valuation model, IDP Education seems to be fairly priced at around 14% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy IDP Education today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth A$27.30, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since IDP Education’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.
Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. IDP Education's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 71%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.
 IEL’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?
 If you’ve been keeping an eye on IEL, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

Institutional investors may adopt severe steps after IDP Education Limited's (ASX:IEL) latest 7.2% drop adds to a year losses 2023-11-27T21:47:01.000Z

A look at the shareholders of IDP Education Limited (
) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 71% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
And institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's share price fell by 7.2% last week. This set of investors may especially be concerned about the current loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 25% for shareholders. Often called “market movers", institutions wield significant power in influencing the price dynamics of any stock. As a result, if the decline continues, institutional investors may be pressured to sell IDP Education which might hurt individual investors.
Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of IDP Education, beginning with the chart below.
Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.
We can see that IDP Education does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at IDP Education's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.
Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. IDP Education is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that Bangarra Group is the largest shareholder with 10% of shares outstanding. The second and third largest shareholders are Challenger Limited and State Street Global Advisors, Inc., with an equal amount of shares to their name at 6.3%.
We also observed that the top 9 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.
I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.
Our information suggests that IDP Education Limited insiders own under 1% of the company. It's a big company, so even a small proportional interest can create alignment between the board and shareholders. In this case insiders own AU$6.5m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking 
The general public-- including retail investors -- own 29% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

Investing in IDP Education (ASX:IEL) five years ago would have delivered you a 114% gain 2023-12-29T00:09:27.000Z

When you buy shares in a company, it's worth keeping in mind the possibility that it could fail, and you could lose your money. But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. Long term 
 (ASX:IEL) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 104% in five years. Then again, the 8.3% share price decline hasn't been so fun for shareholders.
So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.
While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).
Over half a decade, IDP Education managed to grow its earnings per share at 21% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 15% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.
The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).
We like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. This 
 interactive report on IDP Education's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.
It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for IDP Education the TSR over the last 5 years was 114%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!
IDP Education shareholders are down 25% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 12%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 16%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. Investors who like to make money usually check up on insider purchases, such as the price paid, and total amount bought.

IDP Education (ASX:IEL) Could Be Struggling To Allocate Capital 2024-01-12T00:27:09.000Z

Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics. Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing 
 on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing 
 of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Having said that, while the ROCE is currently high for 
 (ASX:IEL), we aren't jumping out of our chairs because returns are decreasing.
If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for IDP Education, this is the formula:
0.25 = AU$221m ÷ (AU$1.2b - AU$351m) 
.
Therefore, 
 In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Consumer Services industry average of 7.2%.
In the above chart we have measured IDP Education's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering IDP Education here for 
On the surface, the trend of ROCE at IDP Education doesn't inspire confidence. Historically returns on capital were even higher at 44%, but they have dropped over the last five years. However, given capital employed and revenue have both increased it appears that the business is currently pursuing growth, at the consequence of short term returns. If these investments prove successful, this can bode very well for long term stock performance.
On a related note, IDP Education has decreased its current liabilities to 28% of total assets. So we could link some of this to the decrease in ROCE. Effectively this means their suppliers or short-term creditors are funding less of the business, which reduces some elements of risk. Since the business is basically funding more of its operations with it's own money, you could argue this has made the business less efficient at generating ROCE.
Even though returns on capital have fallen in the short term, we find it promising that revenue and capital employed have both increased for IDP Education. And the stock has followed suit returning a meaningful 94% to shareholders over the last five years. So while the underlying trends could already be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.
IDP Education could be trading at an attractive price in other respects, so you might find our

IDP Education Limited's (ASX:IEL) Stock Has Been Sliding But Fundamentals Look Strong: Is The Market Wrong? 2024-01-26T02:52:03.000Z

With its stock down 9.6% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard IDP Education (ASX:IEL). However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. In this article, we decided to focus on 
 ROE.
Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for IDP Education is:
29% = AU$149m ÷ AU$517m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).
The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every A$1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn A$0.29 in profit.
We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or "retain", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.
First thing first, we like that IDP Education has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 4.9% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. This probably laid the groundwork for IDP Education's moderate 18% net income growth seen over the past five years.
As a next step, we compared IDP Education's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 18% in the same period.
The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for IEL? You can find out in
IDP Education has a significant three-year median payout ratio of 63%, meaning that it is left with only 37% to reinvest into its business. This implies that the company has been able to achieve decent earnings growth despite returning most of its profits to shareholders.
Moreover, IDP Education is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of seven years of paying a dividend. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 75%. Regardless, the future ROE for IDP Education is predicted to rise to 37% despite there being not much change expected in its payout ratio.
On the whole, we feel that IDP Education's performance has been quite good. In particular, its high ROE is quite noteworthy and also the probable explanation behind its considerable earnings growth. Yet, the company is retaining a small portion of its profits. Which means that the company has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's not too bad. We also studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that the company's earnings growth is expected be similar to its current growth rate. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

IDP Education (ASX:IEL) Will Pay A Larger Dividend Than Last Year At A$0.25 2024-02-21T22:55:30.000Z

The board of 
 (
) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend by 19% on the 27th of March to A$0.25, up from last year's comparable payment of A$0.21. The payment will take the dividend yield to 2.1%, which is in line with the average for the industry.
Unless the payments are sustainable, the dividend yield doesn't mean too much. The last dividend made up a very large portion of earnings and also represented 93% of free cash flows. This is usually an indication that the focus of the company is returning cash to shareholders rather than reinvesting it for growth.
The next year is set to see EPS grow by 56.2%. Assuming the dividend continues along the course it has been charting recently, our estimates show the payout ratio being 55% which brings it into quite a comfortable range.
Looking back, IDP Education's dividend hasn't been particularly consistent. If the company cuts once, it definitely isn't argument against the possibility of it cutting in the future. Since 2017, the annual payment back then was A$0.055, compared to the most recent full-year payment of A$0.41. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 33% over that duration. IDP Education has grown distributions at a rapid rate despite cutting the dividend at least once in the past. Companies that cut once often cut again, so we would be cautious about buying this stock solely for the dividend income.
With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share is growing, which could point to a growing dividend in the future. We are encouraged to see that IDP Education has grown earnings per share at 19% per year over the past five years. The payout ratio is very much on the higher end, which could mean that the growth rate will slow down in the future, and that could flow through to the dividend as well.
Overall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think IDP Education will make a great income stock. Strong earnings growth means IDP Education has the potential to be a good dividend stock in the future, despite the current payments being at elevated levels. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.
It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Earnings growth generally bodes well for the future value of company dividend payments. See if the 15 IDP Education analysts we track are forecasting continued growth with our

Should Income Investors Look At IDP Education Limited (ASX:IEL) Before Its Ex-Dividend? 2024-03-02T23:11:13.000Z

Some investors rely on dividends for growing their wealth, and if you're one of those dividend sleuths, you might be intrigued to know that 
 (
) is about to go ex-dividend in just four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Accordingly, IDP Education investors that purchase the stock on or after the 7th of March will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 27th of March.
The company's upcoming dividend is AU$0.25 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of AU$0.41 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, IDP Education has a trailing yield of 2.1% on the current stock price of AU$19.22. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing.
If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. It paid out 77% of its earnings as dividends last year, which is not unreasonable, but limits reinvestment in the business and leaves the dividend vulnerable to a business downturn. It could become a concern if earnings started to decline. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether IDP Education generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. It paid out 93% of its free cash flow in the form of dividends last year, which is outside the comfort zone for most businesses. Companies usually need cash more than they need earnings - expenses don't pay themselves - so it's not great to see it paying out so much of its cash flow.
While IDP Education's dividends were covered by the company's reported profits, cash is somewhat more important, so it's not great to see that the company didn't generate enough cash to pay its dividend. Cash is king, as they say, and were IDP Education to repeatedly pay dividends that aren't well covered by cashflow, we would consider this a warning sign.
Click 
Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. It's encouraging to see IDP Education has grown its earnings rapidly, up 23% a year for the past five years. Earnings have been growing quickly, but we're concerned dividend payments consumed most of the company's cash flow over the past year.
Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the past eight years, IDP Education has increased its dividend at approximately 29% a year on average. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.
Is IDP Education an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Earnings per share growth is a positive, and the company's payout ratio looks normal. However, we note IDP Education paid out a much higher percentage of its free cash flow, which makes us uncomfortable. To summarise, IDP Education looks okay on this analysis, although it doesn't appear a stand-out opportunity.

IDP Education Limited (ASX:IEL) Shares Could Be 34% Below Their Intrinsic Value Estimate 2024-03-24T22:16:14.000Z

Does the March share price for IDP Education Limited (
) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.
We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the 
 may be something of interest to you.
We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:
 = AU$2.2b
The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.3%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$414m× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.3%– 2.2%) = AU$10b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$10b÷ ( 1 + 6.3%)
= AU$5.6b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is AU$7.8b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of AU$18.5, the company appears quite undervalued at a 34% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.
We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at IDP Education as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.889. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For IDP Education, we've compiled three important items you should consider:

At AU$16.44, Is IDP Education Limited (ASX:IEL) Worth Looking At Closely? 2024-04-22T01:01:58.000Z

While IDP Education Limited (
) might not have the largest market cap around , it saw significant share price movement during recent months on the ASX, rising to highs of AU$22.06 and falling to the lows of AU$16.03. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether IDP Education's current trading price of AU$16.44 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at IDP Education’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.
Great news for investors – IDP Education is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to our valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is A$24.63, but it is currently trading at AU$16.44 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because IDP Education’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.
Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. IDP Education's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 52%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.
 Since IEL is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.
 If you’ve been keeping an eye on IEL for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy IEL. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed buy.

The one-year underlying earnings growth at IDP Education (ASX:IEL) is promising, but the shareholders are still in the red over that time 2024-06-06T01:23:26.000Z

Investors can approximate the average market return by buying an index fund. Active investors aim to buy stocks that vastly outperform the market - but in the process, they risk under-performance. That downside risk was realized by 
 (
) shareholders over the last year, as the share price declined 32%. That's disappointing when you consider the market returned 13%. To make matters worse, the returns over three years have also been really disappointing (the share price is 30% lower than three years ago). Furthermore, it's down 16% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders.
Given the past week has been tough on shareholders, let's investigate the fundamentals and see what we can learn.
While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.
Even though the IDP Education share price is down over the year, its EPS actually improved. It could be that the share price was previously over-hyped.
It's fair to say that the share price does not seem to be reflecting the EPS growth. So it's well worth checking out some other metrics, too.
IDP Education's revenue is actually up 18% over the last year. Since the fundamental metrics don't readily explain the share price drop, there might be an opportunity if the market has overreacted.
You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).
It's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. This 
 
 should help you form a view on IDP Education
IDP Education shareholders are down 30% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 13%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 1.8% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. Investors who like to make money usually check up on insider purchases, such as the price paid, and total amount bought.

IDP Education (ASX:IEL) Is Reinvesting At Lower Rates Of Return 2024-06-22T23:42:26.000Z

If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing 
 on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing 
 of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So when we looked at 
 (
), they do have a high ROCE, but we weren't exactly elated from how returns are trending.
If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for IDP Education:
0.25 = AU$246m ÷ (AU$1.3b - AU$289m) 
.
So, 
 In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Consumer Services industry average of 7.5%.
Above you can see how the current ROCE for IDP Education compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can 
 for 
When we looked at the ROCE trend at IDP Education, we didn't gain much confidence. While it's comforting that the ROCE is high, five years ago it was 39%. Although, given both revenue and the amount of assets employed in the business have increased, it could suggest the company is investing in growth, and the extra capital has led to a short-term reduction in ROCE. If these investments prove successful, this can bode very well for long term stock performance.
On a related note, IDP Education has decreased its current liabilities to 23% of total assets. That could partly explain why the ROCE has dropped. What's more, this can reduce some aspects of risk to the business because now the company's suppliers or short-term creditors are funding less of its operations. Since the business is basically funding more of its operations with it's own money, you could argue this has made the business less efficient at generating ROCE.
In summary, despite lower returns in the short term, we're encouraged to see that IDP Education is reinvesting for growth and has higher sales as a result. These growth trends haven't led to growth returns though, since the stock has fallen 13% over the last five years. As a result, we'd recommend researching this stock further to uncover what other fundamentals of the business can show us.

IDP Education Limited (ASX:IEL) Stock Has Shown Weakness Lately But Financials Look Strong: Should Prospective Shareholders Make The Leap? 2024-07-12T05:01:56.000Z

IDP Education (ASX:IEL) has had a rough three months with its share price down 13%. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Specifically, we decided to study 
 ROE in this article.
ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.
The 
 is:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for IDP Education is:
30% = AU$164m ÷ AU$550m (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).
The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every A$1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of A$0.30.
Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or "retain", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
First thing first, we like that IDP Education has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 6.2% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. So, the substantial 22% net income growth seen by IDP Education over the past five years isn't overly surprising.
Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that IDP Education's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 14% in the same period, which is great to see.
Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is IEL fairly valued? This
 has everything you need to know.
IDP Education has a significant three-year median payout ratio of 72%, meaning the company only retains 28% of its income. This implies that the company has been able to achieve high earnings growth despite returning most of its profits to shareholders.
Besides, IDP Education has been paying dividends over a period of eight years. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 71%. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 32%.
Overall, we are quite pleased with IDP Education's performance. We are particularly impressed by the considerable earnings growth posted by the company, which was likely backed by its high ROE. While the company is paying out most of its earnings as dividends, it has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's probably a good sign. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?
