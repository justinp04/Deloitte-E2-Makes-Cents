Is IGO Limited (ASX:IGO) Trading At A 33% Discount? 2023-08-29T05:52:31.000Z

Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of IGO Limited (
) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.
Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the 
.
We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:
 = AU$6.7b
We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.7%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$941m× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.7%– 2.0%) = AU$17b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$17b÷ ( 1 + 7.7%)
= AU$8.0b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is AU$15b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of AU$12.9, the company appears quite undervalued at a 33% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.
We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at IGO as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.145. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For IGO, we've put together three important aspects you should look at:

IGO (ASX:IGO) Is Paying Out A Larger Dividend Than Last Year 2023-09-02T22:11:24.000Z

 (
) will increase its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 28th of September to A$0.60. The payment will take the dividend yield to 6.4%, which is in line with the average for the industry.
We aren't too impressed by dividend yields unless they can be sustained over time. Prior to this announcement, IGO's dividend made up quite a large proportion of earnings but only 61% of free cash flows. This leaves plenty of cash for reinvestment into the business.
Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 107.0% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along the course it has been charting recently, our estimates show the payout ratio being 60% which brings it into quite a comfortable range.
Although the company has a long dividend history, it has been cut at least once in the last 10 years. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from A$0.02 total annually to A$0.88. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 46% a year over that time. It is great to see strong growth in the dividend payments, but cuts are concerning as it may indicate the payout policy is too ambitious.
With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share is growing, which could point to a growing dividend in the future. IGO has impressed us by growing EPS at 52% per year over the past five years. Earnings per share is growing nicely, but the company is paying out most of its earnings as dividends. This might be sustainable, but we wonder why IGO is not retaining those earnings to reinvest in growth.
Overall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think IGO will make a great income stock. The company is generating plenty of cash, which could maintain the dividend for a while, but the track record hasn't been great. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.
Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 
 that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas? Try our

Institutional investors may adopt severe steps after IGO Limited's (ASX:IGO) latest 8.3% drop adds to a year losses 2023-09-27T03:38:26.000Z

If you want to know who really controls IGO Limited (
), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 51% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).
And institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's share price fell by 8.3% last week. This set of investors may especially be concerned about the current loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 9.6% for shareholders. Often called “market movers", institutions wield significant power in influencing the price dynamics of any stock. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell IGO, which might have negative implications on individual investors.
Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of IGO, beginning with the chart below.
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
IGO already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see IGO's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in IGO. Yandal Investments Pty Ltd is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.9% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.7% and 7.6%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.
A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 11 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.
While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of IGO Limited in their own names. We do note, however, it is possible insiders have an indirect interest through a private company or other corporate structure. It is a pretty big company, so it would be possible for board members to own a meaningful interest in the company, without owning much of a proportional interest. In this case, they own around AU$23m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably, recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can 
The general public-- including retail investors -- own 38% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.
It seems that Private Companies own 11%, of the IGO stock. It might be worth looking deeper into this. If related parties, such as insiders, have an interest in one of these private companies, that should be disclosed in the annual report. Private companies may also have a strategic interest in the company.
It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand IGO better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the

IGO Limited's (ASX:IGO) Fundamentals Look Pretty Strong: Could The Market Be Wrong About The Stock? 2023-10-25T04:50:38.000Z

IGO (ASX:IGO) has had a rough three months with its share price down 24%. But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. Particularly, we will be paying attention to 
 ROE today.
Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.
The 
 is:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for IGO is:
14% = AU$549m ÷ AU$3.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).
The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every A$1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated A$0.14 in profit.
So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or "retain", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.
To start with, IGO's ROE looks acceptable. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 10%. Probably as a result of this, IGO was able to see an impressive net income growth of 52% over the last five years. We believe that there might also be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.
As a next step, we compared IGO's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 23%.
The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is IGO fairly valued? This
 has everything you need to know.
The high three-year median payout ratio of 58% (implying that it keeps only 42% of profits) for IGO suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of the earnings to its shareholders.
Besides, IGO has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 39% over the next three years. The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 19% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio.
Overall, we are quite pleased with IGO's performance. Especially the high ROE, Which has contributed to the impressive growth seen in earnings. Despite the company reinvesting only a small portion of its profits, it still has managed to grow its earnings so that is appreciable. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

Investing in IGO (ASX:IGO) five years ago would have delivered you a 166% gain 2023-11-09T00:12:09.000Z

While 
 (
) shareholders are probably generally happy, the stock hasn't had particularly good run recently, with the share price falling 30% in the last quarter. But in stark contrast, the returns over the last half decade have impressed. In fact, the share price is 131% higher today. Generally speaking the long term returns will give you a better idea of business quality than short periods can. Ultimately business performance will determine whether the stock price continues the positive long term trend. Unfortunately not all shareholders will have held it for the long term, so spare a thought for those caught in the 42% decline over the last twelve months.
With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.
While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.
During five years of share price growth, IGO achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 52% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 18% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.
The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).
It's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of IGO's 
.
When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between 
 (TSR) and 
. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for IGO the TSR over the last 5 years was 166%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the 
 shareholder return.
Investors in IGO had a tough year, with a total loss of 39% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 3.9%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 22% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the

IGO is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this

Australian lithium output cuts seen on price slump 2024-01-23T05:31:12.000Z

*
Lithium downturn seen shorter term than structural nickel glut
*
Miners have cash cushion due to 2022 price surge
*
Customer pushback might cause production curtailments
By Melanie Burton
MELBOURNE, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Australian lithium producers may be set to track the nickel industry in project curtailments and delays this reporting season, analysts say, given slower than expected electric vehicle (EV) sales, but the jolt is expected to be less severe.
Both sectors are contending with a sharp drop in raw materials prices because of the EV slowdown, but lithium is expected to snap back faster because its oversupply is seen as short term.
Nickel miners have come under pressure because of a surge in Indonesian supply that has hammered prices and triggered a spate of writedowns, reflecting a shift in market structure that could last as long as three years, according to First Quantum.
"If you have a prolonged period of depressed pricing then there is the potential to see additional capacity curtailments and or delays, or deferrals of new projects and capacity," said analyst Reg Spencer of Canaccord in Sydney.
"(But) the energy transition has not gone away, it’s just a period of slower demand growth," he added.
Core Lithium on Jan. 5 announced job cuts and suspended mining at its Finiss operations in the Northern Territory while Liontown Resources had to return to market to restructure its debt on Monday which sent its shares tumbling more than a quarter.
After a six-fold surge in prices from late 2021, lithium miners like Pilbara Minerals have built up a cash cushion that offers protection as prices reverse course, said Glyn Lawcock of Barrenjoey. Pilbara reports on Wednesday.
But even cash rich miners may seek to cut production of lithium ore spodumene if their customers want less, he added, since chemicals makers are facing a glut of existing inventories for a product with only a six-month shelf life.
"We're looking to see whether there's any signs of customers saying, well, we don't need as much spodumene right now because we're just not ready to convert it," he said.
The world's largest low-cost lithium mine, Greenbushes in Western Australia, has mothballed production before and IGO Ltd in September flagged cuts could be on the table.
The joint venture between China's Tianqi Lithium, IGO and Albemarle produced 1.49 million tonnes of spodumene in the 2022-2023 financial year.
Tianqi and IGO also own the Kwinana Lithium Hydroxide Refinery which has been running well below capacity.
Mining services billionaire Chris Ellison's Mineral Resources operates three lithium mines. It reports on Thursday.
Mt Marion, which it half owns with Ganfeng Lithium has capacity of 600,000 tonnes of spodumene.
It has a half share in the Wodgina mine with Albemarle, which has capacity for up to 750,000 tonnes of spodumene and its recently acquired Bald Hill which can produce 150,000 tonnes.
IGO, which has flagged a further writedown at its Cosmos nickel project, will be closely watched for lithium developments and its plan to develop a battery chemicals plant near Perth when it reports under new CEO Ivan Vella on Jan. 31. (Reporting by Melanie Burton; Editing by Stephen Coates)

IGO Limited (ASX:IGO) is definitely on the radar of institutional investors who own 50% of the company 2024-04-05T20:17:59.000Z

To get a sense of who is truly in control of IGO Limited (
), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 50% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.
Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.
Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about IGO.
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
IGO already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at IGO's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.
IGO is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Yandal Investments Pty. Ltd. with 8.9% of shares outstanding. With 8.7% and 6.1% of the shares outstanding respectively, Fidelity International Ltd and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.
Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 14 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.
Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of IGO Limited. But they may have an indirect interest through a corporate structure that we haven't picked up on. It's a big company, so even a small proportional interest can create alignment between the board and shareholders. In this case insiders own AU$15m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking 
With a 39% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over IGO. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.
We can see that Private Companies own 11%, of the shares on issue. Private companies may be related parties. Sometimes insiders have an interest in a public company through a holding in a private company, rather than in their own capacity as an individual. While it's hard to draw any broad stroke conclusions, it is worth noting as an area for further research.
It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand IGO better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 
 you should know about.
If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check

Amidst a cautiously optimistic backdrop in the Australian market, with the ASX200 poised for growth following positive global cues and key economic data on the horizon, investors are keenly watching how different sectors respond. In this environment, understanding what constitutes a strong dividend stock becomes crucial, especially considering current fluctuations in commodity prices and broader economic indicators.
Here we highlight a subset of our preferred stocks from the screener.
 ★★★★☆☆
 IGO Limited is an Australian exploration and mining company specializing in metals critical for clean energy, with a market capitalization of approximately A$5.88 billion.
 IGO Limited generates revenue primarily through its Nova Operation and Forrestania Operation, which collectively brought in A$903.40 million.
 7.1%
IGO's current trading value is significantly below our fair value estimate, suggesting potential undervaluation. Despite a decade of increasing dividends, the sustainability is concerning with a high payout ratio of 185% and dividends not well covered by earnings. Recent financials show a decline in net income from A$612.3 million to A$288.3 million year-over-year and lower profit margins compared to last year. However, IGO's dividend yield remains competitive at 7.07%, ranking in the top quartile in Australia, supported by a reasonable cash payout ratio of 39.7%.
 ★★★★★☆
 Nick Scali Limited operates in the sourcing and retailing of household furniture and related accessories across Australia and New Zealand, with a market capitalization of approximately A$1.18 billion.
 Nick Scali Limited generates its revenue primarily through the retailing of furniture, which amounted to A$450.45 million.
 4.8%
Nick Scali Limited, despite a challenging financial period with sales dropping from A$283.91 million to A$226.63 million and net income decreasing from A$60.57 million to A$43.01 million year-over-year, maintains a stable dividend history over the past decade with recent payments covered adequately by earnings and cash flows, showing payout ratios of 67.9% and 43.4%, respectively. The company's dividend yield stands at 4.8%, which is modest compared to the top Australian dividend payers but is supported by consistent payouts and recent strategic activities including follow-on equity offerings totaling A$110 million and merger discussions, suggesting potential for future stability and growth in shareholder returns.
 ★★★★☆☆
 New Hope Corporation Limited, with a market cap of A$3.96 billion, is engaged in the exploration, development, production, and processing of coal, along with oil and gas properties.
 New Hope Corporation Limited generates A$1.88 billion from coal mining in NSW and A$48.15 million from coal mining and related activities in QLD.
 9.2%
New Hope Corporation experienced a significant drop in sales and net income for the half year ended January 31, 2024, with revenues falling to A$862.95 million from A$1.59 billion and net income decreasing to A$251.67 million from A$668.61 million year-over-year. Despite this downturn, the company maintains a high dividend yield of 9.19%, which ranks in the top 25% of Australian dividend payers. However, its dividends have shown volatility over the past decade and are currently not well-covered by cash flows, given a high cash payout ratio of 90.2%. This scenario raises concerns about the sustainability of future dividend payments without an improvement in financial performance or cash flow management.

 ★★★★☆☆
 IGO Limited is an Australian exploration and mining company specializing in metals critical for clean energy, with a market capitalization of approximately A$6.08 billion.

Despite this, the company maintains a dividend yield of 6.84%, which is high compared to the market average but is poorly supported by earnings, given a payout ratio of 185%. While cash flows cover dividends reasonably well with a cash payout ratio of 39.7%, IGO's dividend history has been volatile over the past decade, reflecting inconsistency in payments despite an overall increase in dividend amounts during this period.
 ★★★★☆☆
 Macquarie Group Limited is a global provider of diversified financial services, operating across Australia, the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia Pacific with a market capitalization of approximately A$70.86 billion.

Despite a decade of increasing dividends, the payments have been volatile, showing inconsistency. Currently, dividends are well-covered by earnings with a payout ratio of 69.8%, and forecasts suggest this will improve slightly to 63% in three years. However, concerns arise from Macquarie's low allowance for bad loans at 44% and a significant portion of liabilities funded through higher-risk external borrowing.
 ★★★★☆☆
 New Hope Corporation Limited, with a market cap of A$4.18 billion, is engaged in the exploration, development, production, and processing of coal and oil and gas properties.

However, its dividends have been marked by volatility over the past decade and are currently not well-supported by cash flows, with a high cash payout ratio of 90.2%.

ASX Dividend Stocks: IGO And Two Others For Your Consideration 2024-06-19T19:05:50.000Z

Over the past year, the Australian market has seen a modest increase of 6.2%, despite recent stagnation with a flat performance over the last week.

However, its dividends have shown volatility over the past decade and are currently not well covered by earnings, with a payout ratio of 185%. Despite this, dividends are reasonably supported by cash flows due to a lower cash payout ratio of 39.7%. Earnings are projected to grow by 23.05% annually, but recent one-off items and declining profit margins raise concerns about the sustainability and reliability of future dividends.

Steering Clear Of Vulcan Steel On The ASX And Exploring One Better Dividend Stock Option 2024-07-07T19:05:47.000Z

Dividend growth is a key indicator of a company's financial health and its ability to sustain and increase payouts to shareholders. However, not every stock that offers dividends is an attractive investment, especially if its dividend history shows signs of decline. In this article, we will explore two Australian stocks: one that presents a promising dividend option and another, Vulcan Steel, which has experienced diminishing dividends, signaling potential caution for investors seeking reliable income streams.
Let's dive into one of the prime choices out of the screener and one to possibly skip over.

 IGO Limited generates revenue primarily through its Nova Operation and Forrestania Operation, totaling approximately A$903.4 million.
 9.3%
IGO Limited, despite a high dividend yield of 9.27%, faces challenges with its sustainability, as the payout ratio stands at 185%, indicating that dividends are not well covered by earnings.

IGO Limited (ASX:IGO) Analysts Just Cut Their EPS Forecasts Substantially 2024-07-31T20:00:18.000Z

One thing we could say about the analysts on 
 (
) - they aren't optimistic, having just made a major negative revision to their near-term (statutory) forecasts for the organization. Both revenue and earnings per share (EPS) estimates were cut sharply as analysts factored in the latest outlook for the business, concluding that they were too optimistic previously.
Following the downgrade, the consensus from 14 analysts covering IGO is for revenues of AU$544m in 2025, implying a stressful 41% decline in sales compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to rise 6.8% to AU$0.32. Previously, the analysts had been modelling revenues of AU$663m and earnings per share (EPS) of AU$0.35 in 2025. It looks like analyst sentiment has declined substantially, with a substantial drop in revenue estimates and a considerable drop in earnings per share numbers as well.
It'll come as no surprise then, to learn that the analysts have cut their price target 7.9% to AU$6.37.
Looking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. We would highlight that sales are expected to reverse, with a forecast 41% annualised revenue decline to the end of 2025. That is a notable change from historical growth of 6.6% over the last five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the industry are forecast to see their revenue decline 0.4% annually for the foreseeable future. So it's pretty clear that IGO's revenues are expected to shrink faster than the wider industry.
The most important thing to take away is that analysts cut their earnings per share estimates, expecting a clear decline in business conditions. Unfortunately they also cut their revenue estimates for this year, and they expect sales to lag the wider market. That said, earnings per share are more important for creating value for shareholders. With a serious cut to this year's expectations and a falling price target, we wouldn't be surprised if investors were becoming wary of IGO.
Still, the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. We have estimates - from multiple IGO analysts - going out to 2027, and you can 
Of course, seeing company management 
 in a stock can be just as useful as knowing whether analysts are downgrading their estimates. So you may also wish to search this
