IGO (ASX:IGO) Is Paying Out A Larger Dividend Than Last Year

 (
) will increase its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 28th of September to A$0.60. The payment will take the dividend yield to 6.4%, which is in line with the average for the industry.
We aren't too impressed by dividend yields unless they can be sustained over time. Prior to this announcement, IGO's dividend made up quite a large proportion of earnings but only 61% of free cash flows. This leaves plenty of cash for reinvestment into the business.
Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 107.0% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along the course it has been charting recently, our estimates show the payout ratio being 60% which brings it into quite a comfortable range.
Although the company has a long dividend history, it has been cut at least once in the last 10 years. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from A$0.02 total annually to A$0.88. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 46% a year over that time. It is great to see strong growth in the dividend payments, but cuts are concerning as it may indicate the payout policy is too ambitious.
With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share is growing, which could point to a growing dividend in the future. IGO has impressed us by growing EPS at 52% per year over the past five years. Earnings per share is growing nicely, but the company is paying out most of its earnings as dividends. This might be sustainable, but we wonder why IGO is not retaining those earnings to reinvest in growth.
Overall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think IGO will make a great income stock. The company is generating plenty of cash, which could maintain the dividend for a while, but the track record hasn't been great. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.
Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 
 that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas? Try our

Is IGO Limited (ASX:IGO) Trading At A 33% Discount?

Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of IGO Limited (
) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.
Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the 
.
We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:
 = AU$6.7b
We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.7%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$941m× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.7%– 2.0%) = AU$17b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$17b÷ ( 1 + 7.7%)
= AU$8.0b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is AU$15b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of AU$12.9, the company appears quite undervalued at a 33% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.
We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at IGO as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.145. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For IGO, we've put together three important aspects you should look at:

3 High-Yielding ASX Dividend Stocks With Yields From 3% To 9.9%

The Australian stock market experienced a downturn this week, with the ASX200 closing down 0.81% and all sectors finishing in the red. This recent volatility highlights the importance of considering stable, high-yielding dividend stocks as part of a diversified investment strategy, especially in times when market recalibrations impact broader economic sentiments.
Let's dive into some prime choices out of from the screener.
 ★★★★☆☆
 IGO Limited is an Australian exploration and mining company specializing in metals critical for clean energy, with a market capitalization of A$4.47 billion.
 IGO Limited generates revenue primarily through its Nova Operation and Forrestania Operation, which collectively contributed A$903.40 million in the latest reporting period.
 9.3%
IGO offers a high dividend yield at 9.31%, ranking in the top 25% of Australian dividend payers. However, its sustainability is questionable with a payout ratio of 185%, indicating dividends are not well covered by earnings. Dividend reliability has been compromised by volatility and undercoverage over the past decade, despite an increase in payments during this period. Recent appointments on the board suggest a strengthening in governance which might impact future financial stability and dividend policies.
 ★★★★☆☆
 Kina Securities Limited, operating in Papua New Guinea, offers a range of services including commercial banking, financial and fund administration, investment management, and share brokerage with a market capitalization of A$281.68 million.
 Kina Securities Limited generates revenue primarily through its Wealth Management and Banking & Finance segments, totaling PGK 37.76 million and PGK 356.68 million respectively.
 10%
Kina Securities offers a high dividend yield of 9.98%, placing it among the top 25% of Australian dividend payers. However, its dividend history is marked by instability, with payments fluctuating significantly over its 8-year dividend-paying tenure. Currently, dividends are supported by earnings with a payout ratio of 70%, but projections show this coverage may decrease to 45.5% in three years. Additionally, the company faces challenges with a high bad loans ratio at 6.4%.
 ★★★★☆☆
 Macquarie Group Limited operates as a diversified financial services provider across regions including Australia, the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia Pacific, with a market capitalization of approximately A$76.41 billion.
 Macquarie Group Limited generates revenue through five primary segments: Macquarie Capital at A$2.61 billion, Macquarie Asset Management at A$3.75 billion, Banking and Financial Services at A$3.21 billion, Commodities and Global Markets at A$6.32 billion, and Corporate at A$0.99 billion.
 3%
Macquarie Group's recent involvement in potential acquisitions, such as the renewable energy platform O2 Power and ventures in healthcare, underscores its strategic diversification. Despite a volatile dividend history over the past decade, current dividends are supported by earnings with a 69.8% payout ratio. However, its dividend yield of 3.05% is lower than the top quartile of Australian dividend stocks at 6.28%. Additionally, 60% of its funding comes from higher-risk external borrowing sources, posing potential risks to financial stability.
