Incitec Pivot's (ASX:IPL) investors will be pleased with their notable 58% return over the last three years

By buying an index fund, you can roughly match the market return with ease. But if you buy good businesses at attractive prices, your portfolio returns could exceed the average market return. For example, the 
 (
) share price is up 37% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 19% (not including dividends).
With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.
To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.
Incitec Pivot was able to grow its EPS at 59% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is higher than the 11% average annual increase in the share price. So one could reasonably conclude that the market has cooled on the stock. This cautious sentiment is reflected in its (fairly low) P/E ratio of 6.78.
The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).
We're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of 
.
When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between 
 (TSR) and 
. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Incitec Pivot the TSR over the last 3 years was 58%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!
Investors in Incitec Pivot had a tough year, with a total loss of 13% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 7.6%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 1.2% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered

Investors Will Want Incitec Pivot's (ASX:IPL) Growth In ROCE To Persist

What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing 
 on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's 
 of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. So on that note, 
 (
) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.
For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Incitec Pivot, this is the formula:
0.14 = AU$1.2b รท (AU$10b - AU$1.4b) 
.
Therefore, 
 In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Chemicals industry average of 8.7% it's much better.
In the above chart we have measured Incitec Pivot's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Incitec Pivot 
 for 
We like the trends that we're seeing from Incitec Pivot. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 14%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 31%. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Incitec Pivot thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.
All in all, it's terrific to see that Incitec Pivot is reaping the rewards from prior investments and is growing its capital base. Given the stock has declined 21% in the last five years, this could be a good investment if the valuation and other metrics are also appealing. That being the case, research into the company's current valuation metrics and future prospects seems fitting.

Incitec Pivot's (ASX:IPL) Dividend Will Be Reduced To A$0.05

 (
) dividend is being reduced from last year's payment covering the same period to A$0.05 on the 19th of December. This means the annual payment is 5.0% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry.
While it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable. Based on the last payment, the company wasn't making enough to cover what it was paying to shareholders. This situation certainly isn't ideal, and could place significant strain on the balance sheet if it continues.
Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 60.2%. Under the assumption that the dividend will continue along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 69% which would be quite comfortable going to take the dividend forward.
The company has a long dividend track record, but it doesn't look great with cuts in the past. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from A$0.092 total annually to A$0.15. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 5.0% per annum over that time. We have seen cuts in the past, so while the growth looks promising we would be a little bit cautious about its track record.
Growing earnings per share could be a mitigating factor when considering the past fluctuations in the dividend. Earnings have grown at around 2.6% a year for the past five years, which isn't massive but still better than seeing them shrink. The company is paying out a lot of its profits, even though it is growing those profits pretty slowly. As they say in finance, 'past performance is not indicative of future performance', but we are not confident a company with limited earnings growth and a high payout ratio will be a star dividend-payer over the next decade.
Overall, the dividend looks like it may have been a bit high, which explains why it has now been cut. The payments are bit high to be considered sustainable, and the track record isn't the best. We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.
Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. Just as an example, we've come across

Why It Might Not Make Sense To Buy Incitec Pivot Limited (ASX:IPL) For Its Upcoming Dividend

Readers hoping to buy 
 (
) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Meaning, you will need to purchase Incitec Pivot's shares before the 4th of December to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 19th of December.
The company's next dividend payment will be AU$0.05 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of AU$0.15 per share. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Incitec Pivot has a trailing yield of approximately 5.2% on its current stock price of A$2.91. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. As a result, readers should always check whether Incitec Pivot has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut.
Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Last year, Incitec Pivot paid out 105% of its income as dividends, which is above a level that we're comfortable with, especially if the company needs to reinvest in its business. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Over the last year, it paid out dividends equivalent to 255% of what it generated in free cash flow, a disturbingly high percentage. Unless there were something in the business we're not grasping, this could signal a risk that the dividend may have to be cut in the future.
Cash is slightly more important than profit from a dividend perspective, but given Incitec Pivot's payments were not well covered by either earnings or cash flow, we are concerned about the sustainability of this dividend.
Click 
Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. This is why it's a relief to see Incitec Pivot earnings per share are up 2.6% per annum over the last five years. With limited earnings growth and paying out a concerningly high percentage of its earnings, the prospects of future dividend growth don't look so bright here.
Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Incitec Pivot has delivered 5.0% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.
Is Incitec Pivot an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? The dividends are not well covered by either income or free cash flow, although at least earnings per share are slowly increasing. Bottom line: Incitec Pivot has some unfortunate characteristics that we think could lead to sub-optimal outcomes for dividend investors.
So if you're still interested in Incitec Pivot despite it's poor dividend qualities, you should be well informed on some of the risks facing this stock. To that end, you should learn about the

Australia's Incitec Pivot names new chief executive

(Reuters) - Incitec Pivot said on Tuesday Mauro Neves de Moraes will join the Australian fertilizer maker as its chief executive officer and managing director, effective Jan. 22, 2024.

Is Incitec Pivot Limited (ASX:IPL) Trading At A 40% Discount?

Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Incitec Pivot Limited (ASX:IPL) as an investment opportunity by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.
Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the 
.
We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:
 = AU$3.8b
The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.6%.
= FCF
 ร (1 + g) รท (r โ g) = AU$555mร (1 + 2.1%) รท (7.6%โ 2.1%) = AU$10b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$10bรท ( 1 + 7.6%)
= AU$5.0b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is AU$8.7b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of AU$2.7, the company appears quite good value at a 40% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.
Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Incitec Pivot as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.097. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Incitec Pivot, there are three essential factors you should explore:

Incitec Pivot Limited's (ASX:IPL) Fundamentals Look Pretty Strong: Could The Market Be Wrong About The Stock?

With its stock down 9.6% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard Incitec Pivot (ASX:IPL). However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. In this article, we decided to focus on Incitec Pivot's ROE.
Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.
The 
 is:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) รท Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Incitec Pivot is:
4.3% = AU$277m รท AU$6.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).
The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every A$1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated A$0.04 in profit.
So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or "retain", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.
At first glance, Incitec Pivot's ROE doesn't look very promising. Yet, a closer study shows that the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 5.3%. Looking at Incitec Pivot's exceptional 35% five-year net income growth in particular, we are definitely impressed. Given the slightly low ROE, it is likely that there could be some other aspects that are driving this growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.
As a next step, we compared Incitec Pivot's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 14%.
Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. Itโs important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for IPL? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report.
Incitec Pivot has a significant three-year median payout ratio of 81%, meaning the company only retains 19% of its income. This implies that the company has been able to achieve high earnings growth despite returning most of its profits to shareholders.
Besides, Incitec Pivot has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 48% over the next three years. The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 6.3% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio.
Overall, we feel that Incitec Pivot certainly does have some positive factors to consider. That is, quite an impressive growth in earnings. However, the low profit retention means that the company's earnings growth could have been higher, had it been reinvesting a higher portion of its profits. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

Incitec Pivot (ASX:IPL) shareholders have endured a 10% loss from investing in the stock a year ago

It's easy to match the overall market return by buying an index fund. But if you buy individual stocks, you can do both better or worse than that. Investors in 
 (
) have tasted that bitter downside in the last year, as the share price dropped 22%. That falls noticeably short of the market return of around 7.1%. The silver lining (for longer term investors) is that the stock is still 1.9% higher than it was three years ago. Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 11% in the last 90 days.
So let's have a look and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.
While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.
Unfortunately Incitec Pivot reported an EPS drop of 57% for the last year. This fall in the EPS is significantly worse than the 22% the share price fall. It may have been that the weak EPS was not as bad as some had feared.
The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).
Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of 
.
As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Incitec Pivot the TSR over the last 1 year was -10%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!
Investors in Incitec Pivot had a tough year, with a total loss of 10% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 7.1%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 1.2% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Incitec Pivot better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified 
 that you should be aware of.

RBC: Incitec Pivot explosives business booms; fertilizer sale talks continue

Investing.com - Incitec Pivot Ltd (ASX:IPL) has announced its H1 2024 results. The headline EBIT reached $249m, surpassing RBC's prediction of $207m and the consensus estimate of $206m. However, comparing these figures directly with market estimates is challenging due to the impact of restructuring, one-offs, and discontinued operations. The company declared an ordinary dividend of 4.3 cents per share, supplemented by a special dividend of 10.2 cents per share.
Key Insights:
โข Future Outlook: The company maintains a positive outlook for FY24, with Dyno Nobel's earnings outlook remaining unchanged. Dyno Nobel Asia Pacific (DNA) anticipates EBIT growth in the mid-to-high single digits, while Dyno Nobel Americas (DNAP) expects to surpass its previous record earnings with the recontracting process nearing completion.
โข Fertilizer Sale Update: Advanced negotiations with PT Pupuk Kalimantan Timur for a cash consideration are ongoing. However, there is no guarantee of reaching an agreement or concluding a sale. As a result, the anticipated buyback of up to $900m remains on hold.
โข Fertilizer: The Fertilizer sector reported an EBIT of $10m, down 91% YoY, with margins falling by 9%. Despite increased margins and market growth in its Distribution business and a reduction in gas costs from FY23, risks persist. An impairment cost of $408m after tax was also included as an individually material item (IMI (LON:IMI)).
โข Dyno Nobel Asia Pacific: The sector posted an EBIT of $108m, up 36% YoY, with margins improving by 4%. The EBIT increase was driven by successful recontracting, BMA expansion, growth in technology, and opportunities in EMEA through the Titonobel business.
โข Dyno Nobel Americas: The Americas sector reported an EBIT of $154m, down 61% YoY, with margins decreasing by 14%. However, growth in Metals and Chile, improved pricing, and cost maintenance contributed to margin improvements. The result also benefited from an increase in manufacturing reliability and the WALA offtake agreement.

Individual investors account for 52% of Incitec Pivot Limited's (ASX:IPL) ownership, while institutions account for 39%

To get a sense of who is truly in control of Incitec Pivot Limited (
), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that individual investors own the lion's share in the company with 52% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).
Meanwhile, institutions make up 39% of the companyโs shareholders. Insiders often own a large chunk of younger, smaller, companies while huge companies tend to have institutions as shareholders.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Incitec Pivot.
Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.
We can see that Incitec Pivot does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Incitec Pivot's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
It would appear that 8.9% of Incitec Pivot shares are controlled by hedge funds. That's interesting, because hedge funds can be quite active and activist. Many look for medium term catalysts that will drive the share price higher. Our data shows that Janchor Partners Limited is the largest shareholder with 8.9% of shares outstanding. With 6.1% and 5.1% of the shares outstanding respectively, Orbis Investment Management Limited and The Vanguard Group, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.
On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.
While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.
Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Incitec Pivot Limited in their own names. It's a big company, so even a small proportional interest can create alignment between the board and shareholders. In this case insiders own AU$6.9m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking 
The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a substantial 52% stake in Incitec Pivot, suggesting it is a fairly popular stock. This level of ownership gives investors from the wider public some power to sway key policy decisions such as board composition, executive compensation, and the dividend payout ratio.

Incitec Pivot's (ASX:IPL) Shareholders Will Receive A Smaller Dividend Than Last Year

 (
) has announced that on 4th of July, it will be paying a dividend ofA$0.043, which a reduction from last year's comparable dividend. The yield is still above the industry average at 5.0%.
If the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. Incitec Pivot isn't generating any profits, and it is paying out a very high proportion of the cash it is earning. These payout levels would generally be quite difficult to keep up.
Earnings per share is forecast to rise exponentially over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we could see the payout ratio reach 426%, which is on the unsustainable side.
The company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years. The dividend has gone from an annual total of A$0.092 in 2014 to the most recent total annual payment of A$0.15. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 5.0% a year over that time. We like to see dividends have grown at a reasonable rate, but with at least one substantial cut in the payments, we're not certain this dividend stock would be ideal for someone intending to live on the income.
Given that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. We are encouraged to see that Incitec Pivot has grown earnings per share at 7.0% per year over the past five years. It's not an ideal situation that the company isn't turning a profit but the growth recently is a positive sign. Assuming the company can post positive net income numbers soon, it could has the potential to be a decent dividend payer.
In summary, dividends being cut isn't ideal, however it can bring the payment into a more sustainable range. The track record isn't great, and the payments are a bit high to be considered sustainable. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.
It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. As an example, we've identified

Incitec Pivot Limited's (ASX:IPL) Intrinsic Value Is Potentially 95% Above Its Share Price

How far off is Incitec Pivot Limited (
) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!
We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the 
.
We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:
 = AU$3.9b
The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.3%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.3%.
= FCF
 ร (1 + g) รท (r โ g) = AU$684mร (1 + 2.3%) รท (7.3%โ 2.3%) = AU$14b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$14bรท ( 1 + 7.3%)
= AU$6.9b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is AU$11b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of AU$2.9, the company appears quite good value at a 49% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.
Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Incitec Pivot as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.096. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

Incitec Pivot's (ASX:IPL) Dividend Is Being Reduced To A$0.043

 (
) has announced that on 4th of July, it will be paying a dividend ofA$0.043, which a reduction from last year's comparable dividend. The yield is still above the industry average at 5.0%.
If the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. Incitec Pivot is unprofitable despite paying a dividend, and it is paying out 336% of its free cash flow. These payout levels would generally be quite difficult to keep up.
Over the next year, EPS is forecast to grow rapidly. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio could reach 462%, which is unsustainable.
Although the company has a long dividend history, it has been cut at least once in the last 10 years. Since 2014, the annual payment back then was A$0.092, compared to the most recent full-year payment of A$0.15. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 5.0% per annum over that time. A reasonable rate of dividend growth is good to see, but we're wary that the dividend history is not as solid as we'd like, having been cut at least once.
With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share is growing, which could point to a growing dividend in the future. Incitec Pivot has impressed us by growing EPS at 7.0% per year over the past five years. Even though the company isn't making a profit, strong earnings growth could turn that around in the near future. Assuming the company can post positive net income numbers soon, it could has the potential to be a decent dividend payer.
In summary, dividends being cut isn't ideal, however it can bring the payment into a more sustainable range. The track record isn't great, and the payments are a bit high to be considered sustainable. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.
Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. For example, we've picked out
