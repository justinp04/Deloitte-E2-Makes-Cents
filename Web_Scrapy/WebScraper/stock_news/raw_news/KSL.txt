Kina Securities' (ASX:KSL) investors will be pleased with their decent 31% return over the last five years 2023-08-22T21:00:54.000Z

Ideally, your overall portfolio should beat the market average. But the main game is to find enough winners to more than offset the losers At this point some shareholders may be questioning their investment in 
 (
), since the last five years saw the share price fall 21%.
Now let's have a look at the company's fundamentals, and see if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.
To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.
While the share price declined over five years, Kina Securities actually managed to 
 EPS by an average of 24% per year. Given the share price reaction, one might suspect that EPS is not a good guide to the business performance during the period (perhaps due to a one-off loss or gain). Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.
Generally speaking we'd expect to see stronger share price increases on the back of sustained EPS growth, but other metrics may hold a clue to why the share price performance is relatively modest.
We note that the dividend has remained healthy, so that wouldn't really explain the share price drop. It's not immediately clear to us why the stock price is down but further research might provide some answers.

We know that Kina Securities has improved its bottom line lately, but what does the future have in store? So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Kina Securities will

It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Kina Securities the TSR over the last 5 years was 31%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!
Kina Securities shareholders are up 1.6% for the year (even including dividends). But that was short of the market average. If we look back over five years, the returns are even better, coming in at 6% per year for five years. It's quite possible the business continues to execute with prowess, even as the share price gains are slowing. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Investing in Kina Securities (ASX:KSL) three years ago would have delivered you a 17% gain 2024-01-29T22:04:55.000Z

For many investors, the main point of stock picking is to generate higher returns than the overall market. But in any portfolio, there are likely to be some stocks that fall short of that benchmark. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term 
 (
) shareholders, since the share price is down 17% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 28%.
So let's have a look and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.
There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.
Although the share price is down over three years, Kina Securities actually managed to grow EPS by 2.3% per year in that time. This is quite a puzzle, and suggests there might be something temporarily buoying the share price. Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.
It's pretty reasonable to suspect the market was previously to bullish on the stock, and has since moderated expectations. But it's possible a look at other metrics will be enlightening.
Given the healthiness of the dividend payments, we doubt that they've concerned the market. It's good to see that Kina Securities has increased its revenue over the last three years. But it's not clear to us why the share price is down. It might be worth diving deeper into the fundamentals, lest an opportunity goes begging.

As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Kina Securities, it has a TSR of 17% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the 
 shareholder return.
It's nice to see that Kina Securities shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 23% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 7% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

In order to justify the effort of selecting individual stocks, it's worth striving to beat the returns from a market index fund. But every investor is virtually certain to have both over-performing and under-performing stocks. So we wouldn't blame long term 
 (
) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 30% over a half decade.
Now let's have a look at the company's fundamentals, and see if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.
There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.
While the share price declined over five years, Kina Securities actually managed to 
 EPS by an average of 4.5% per year. Given the share price reaction, one might suspect that EPS is not a good guide to the business performance during the period (perhaps due to a one-off loss or gain). Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.
Based on these numbers, we'd venture that the market may have been over-optimistic about forecast growth, half a decade ago. Having said that, we might get a better idea of what's going on with the stock by looking at other metrics.
The steady dividend doesn't really explain why the share price is down. It's not immediately clear to us why the stock price is down but further research might provide some answers.

As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Kina Securities the TSR over the last 5 years was 22%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!
We're pleased to report that Kina Securities shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 43% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 4%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Kina Securities better, we need to consider many other factors.

3 High-Yielding ASX Dividend Stocks With Yields From 3% To 9.9% 2024-07-21T19:08:24.000Z

The Australian stock market experienced a downturn this week, with the ASX200 closing down 0.81% and all sectors finishing in the red. This recent volatility highlights the importance of considering stable, high-yielding dividend stocks as part of a diversified investment strategy, especially in times when market recalibrations impact broader economic sentiments.
Let's dive into some prime choices out of from the screener.
 ★★★★☆☆
 IGO Limited is an Australian exploration and mining company specializing in metals critical for clean energy, with a market capitalization of A$4.47 billion.
 IGO Limited generates revenue primarily through its Nova Operation and Forrestania Operation, which collectively contributed A$903.40 million in the latest reporting period.
 9.3%
IGO offers a high dividend yield at 9.31%, ranking in the top 25% of Australian dividend payers. However, its sustainability is questionable with a payout ratio of 185%, indicating dividends are not well covered by earnings. Dividend reliability has been compromised by volatility and undercoverage over the past decade, despite an increase in payments during this period. Recent appointments on the board suggest a strengthening in governance which might impact future financial stability and dividend policies.
 ★★★★☆☆
 Kina Securities Limited, operating in Papua New Guinea, offers a range of services including commercial banking, financial and fund administration, investment management, and share brokerage with a market capitalization of A$281.68 million.
 Kina Securities Limited generates revenue primarily through its Wealth Management and Banking & Finance segments, totaling PGK 37.76 million and PGK 356.68 million respectively.
 10%
Kina Securities offers a high dividend yield of 9.98%, placing it among the top 25% of Australian dividend payers. However, its dividend history is marked by instability, with payments fluctuating significantly over its 8-year dividend-paying tenure. Currently, dividends are supported by earnings with a payout ratio of 70%, but projections show this coverage may decrease to 45.5% in three years. Additionally, the company faces challenges with a high bad loans ratio at 6.4%.
 ★★★★☆☆
 Macquarie Group Limited operates as a diversified financial services provider across regions including Australia, the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia Pacific, with a market capitalization of approximately A$76.41 billion.
 Macquarie Group Limited generates revenue through five primary segments: Macquarie Capital at A$2.61 billion, Macquarie Asset Management at A$3.75 billion, Banking and Financial Services at A$3.21 billion, Commodities and Global Markets at A$6.32 billion, and Corporate at A$0.99 billion.
 3%
Macquarie Group's recent involvement in potential acquisitions, such as the renewable energy platform O2 Power and ventures in healthcare, underscores its strategic diversification. Despite a volatile dividend history over the past decade, current dividends are supported by earnings with a 69.8% payout ratio. However, its dividend yield of 3.05% is lower than the top quartile of Australian dividend stocks at 6.28%. Additionally, 60% of its funding comes from higher-risk external borrowing sources, posing potential risks to financial stability.
