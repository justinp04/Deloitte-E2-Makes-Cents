Lendlease Group Earnings Missed Analyst Estimates: Here's What Analysts Are Forecasting Now

 (
) came out with its annual results last week, and we wanted to see how the business is performing and what industry forecasters think of the company following this report. Revenues of AU$10b beat expectations by 8.6%. Unfortunately statutory earnings per share (EPS) fell well short of the mark, turning in a loss of AU$0.34 compared to previous analyst expectations of a profit. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year.
Taking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for Lendlease Group from nine analysts is for revenues of AU$10.7b in 2024. If met, it would imply a credible 2.9% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Lendlease Group is also expected to turn profitable, with statutory earnings of AU$0.81 per share. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of AU$11.4b and earnings per share (EPS) of AU$0.74 in 2024. If anything, the analysts look to have become slightly more optimistic overall; while they decreased their revenue forecasts, EPS predictions increased and ultimately earnings are more important.
There's been no real change to the average price target of AU$9.37, with the lower revenue and higher earnings forecasts not expected to meaningfully impact the company's valuation over a longer timeframe. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. There are some variant perceptions on Lendlease Group, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at AU$14.45 and the most bearish at AU$7.05 per share. This is a fairly broad spread of estimates, suggesting that analysts are forecasting a wide range of possible outcomes for the business.
Of course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the 
 itself. For example, we noticed that Lendlease Group's rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with revenues forecast to exhibit 2.9% growth to the end of 2024 on an annualised basis. That is well above its historical decline of 13% a year over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to see their revenue grow 11% per year. Although Lendlease Group's revenues are expected to improve, it seems that the analysts are still bearish on the business, forecasting it to grow slower than the broader industry.
The biggest takeaway for us is the consensus earnings per share upgrade, which suggests a clear improvement in sentiment around Lendlease Group's earnings potential next year. Unfortunately, they also downgraded their revenue estimates, and our data indicates underperformance compared to the wider industry. Even so, earnings per share are more important to the intrinsic value of the business. Even so, earnings are more important to the intrinsic value of the business. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.
With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for Lendlease Group going out to 2026, and you can

Lendlease Group Insiders Added AU$2.1m Of Stock To Their Holdings

Generally, when a single insider buys stock, it is usually not a big deal. However, when several insiders are buying, like in the case of 
 (
), it sends a favourable message to the company's shareholders.
While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.
In the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Independent Non Executive Chairman of the Board Michael Ullmer bought AU$396k worth of shares at a price of AU$7.93 per share. That means that even when the share price was higher than AU$7.13 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. We always take careful note of the price insiders pay when purchasing shares. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock if insiders have bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price.
In the last twelve months Lendlease Group insiders were buying shares, but not selling. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!

Over the last quarter, Lendlease Group insiders have spent a meaningful amount on shares. In total, insiders bought AU$379k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any sales whatsoever. That shows some optimism about the company's future.
Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Insiders own 0.2% of Lendlease Group shares, worth about AU$10m, according to our data. We do generally prefer see higher levels of insider ownership.
It is good to see recent purchasing. We also take confidence from the longer term picture of insider transactions. But we don't feel the same about the fact the company is making losses. Insiders likely see value in Lendlease Group shares, given these transactions (along with notable insider ownership of the company). Of course,

Lendlease Group (ASX:LLC) shareholders have endured a 58% loss from investing in the stock five years ago

We think intelligent long term investing is the way to go. But along the way some stocks are going to perform badly. For example the 
 (
) share price dropped 62% over five years. That is extremely sub-optimal, to say the least. Furthermore, it's down 22% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders.
Since shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns.
Lendlease Group isn't currently profitable, so most analysts would look to revenue growth to get an idea of how fast the underlying business is growing. When a company doesn't make profits, we'd generally expect to see good revenue growth. As you can imagine, fast revenue growth, when maintained, often leads to fast profit growth.
In the last five years Lendlease Group saw its revenue shrink by 13% per year. That's definitely a weaker result than most pre-profit companies report. It seems appropriate, then, that the share price slid about 10% annually during that time. It's fair to say most investors don't like to invest in loss making companies with falling revenue. This looks like a really risky stock to buy, at a glance.
The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).
It's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Lendlease Group will 
.
As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Lendlease Group the TSR over the last 5 years was -58%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the 
 shareholder return.
Lendlease Group shareholders are down 16% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 8.2%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Unfortunately, longer term shareholders are suffering worse, given the loss of 10% doled out over the last five years. We'd need to see some sustained improvements in the key metrics before we could muster much enthusiasm. It is all well and good that insiders have been buying shares, but we suggest you

An Intrinsic Calculation For Lendlease Group (ASX:LLC) Suggests It's 45% Undervalued

Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Lendlease Group (
) as an investment opportunity by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.
We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the 
.
We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:
 = AU$3.1b
We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.8%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$733m× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.8%– 2.0%) = AU$11b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$11b÷ ( 1 + 8.8%)
= AU$4.7b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is AU$7.8b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of AU$6.3, the company appears quite undervalued at a 45% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.
Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Lendlease Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.365. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For Lendlease Group, there are three important elements you should consider:

Lendlease, Google end development deals for $15 billion San Francisco Bay Area projects

By Himanshi Akhand
(Reuters) -Lendlease Group and Alphabet's Google are mutually ending development services deals for four master-planned districts worth $15 billion in the San Francisco Bay Area, the Australian company said on Friday, as developers continue to exit California's real estate market.
Lendlease bagged the contract from Google in 2019 to develop the residential and retail space in Sunnyvale, San Jose and Mountain View, which could ultimately bring around 15,000 new housing units to the region.
California's commercial real estate market is one of the hardest hit globally as remote working has reduced the demand for office space amid declining property values, with companies like Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield, owner of one of San Francisco's biggest shopping centres, also walking away.
Under the project, Lendlease was to develop up to 15 million square feet of residential, retail and hospitality space and Google would develop office space.
"We've been optimizing our real estate investments in the Bay Area, and part of that work is looking at a variety of options to move our development projects forward and deliver on our housing commitment," said Alexa Arena, senior director of development at Google.
As of June-end, 12,900 of the planned housing units were approved for development in San Jose and Mountain View, according to Google.
A spokesperson said the company is still looking to work with both developers and capital partners to move the Bay Area developments forward.
Earlier this year, Lendlease also paused its 47-storey Hayes Point project in central San Francisco, its largest investment in the Americas, looking to line up tenants or find a co-investor.
Lendlease said it will remove the San Francisco Bay project, which was expected to commence construction in fiscal 2026, from its development pipeline.
"While market expectations for the project had deflated over the past ~12-18 months, the change is negative for medium term (FY26-28) earnings," analysts at UBS said.
Lendlease retained its forecast for fiscal 2024, with core operating return on equity at the lower end of its 8%-10% range.

Is Lendlease Group (ASX:LLC) Potentially Undervalued?

Lendlease Group (
), is not the largest company out there, but it saw significant share price movement during recent months on the ASX, rising to highs of AU$8.48 and falling to the lows of AU$6.12. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Lendlease Group's current trading price of AU$6.70 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Lendlease Group’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.
Great news for investors – Lendlease Group is still trading at a fairly cheap price. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is A$11.05, but it is currently trading at AU$6.70 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. What’s more interesting is that, Lendlease Group’s share price is theoretically quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to move to its intrinsic value, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.
Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with a relatively muted revenue growth of 0.2% expected over the next couple of years, growth doesn’t seem like a key driver for a buy decision for Lendlease Group, at least in the short term.
 Even though growth is relatively muted, since LLC is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.
 If you’ve been keeping an eye on LLC for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy LLC. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed buy.

Following a 8.3% decline over last year, recent gains may please Lendlease Group (ASX:LLC) institutional owners

To get a sense of who is truly in control of Lendlease Group (
), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 53% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
Institutional investors would probably welcome last week's 6.0% increase in share prices after a year of 8.3% losses as a sign that returns are likely to begin trending higher.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Lendlease Group.
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Lendlease Group. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Lendlease Group, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.
Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Lendlease Group. Aware Super Pty Ltd is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.7% of shares outstanding. State Street Global Advisors, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.2% of common stock, and Orbis Investment Management Limited holds about 6.3% of the company stock.
A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 24 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.
Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.
Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Lendlease Group. It's a big company, so even a small proportional interest can create alignment between the board and shareholders. In this case insiders own AU$9.9m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking 
The general public-- including retail investors -- own 46% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.
I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Google, Lendlease axe plans for $15 billion development in Bay Area

Alphabet’s Google has scrapped a development deal 
 space in California’s Silicon Valley.
Google and Australian developer Lendlease “mutually reached” a decision to end their San Francisco Bay Project for four master-planned districts in the cities of San Jose, Sunnyvale and Mountain View, Lendlease 
.
“The decision to end these agreements followed a comprehensive review by Google of its real estate investments, and a determination by both organizations that the existing agreements are no longer mutually beneficial given current market conditions,” Lendlease said in a statement.
A Google spokesperson told CNN on Saturday that it is still looking to deliver on its housing commitment but Lendlease would not be its exclusive developer. The tech giant said it is broadening its relationships and will work with both developers and capital partners to move the Bay Area developments forward. The spokesperson added that Google will continue to advance mixed-use entitlements and invest in infrastructure.
“As we’ve shared before, we’ve been optimizing our real estate investments in the Bay Area, and part of that work is looking at a variety of options to move our development projects forward and deliver on our housing commitment,” Alexa Arena, Google’s senior director of development, said Friday in a statement. “We appreciate Lendlease and the work the team has done to get us to this point.”

The announcement comes amid a period of deep cost-cutting and layoffs for Google and during a time when commercial real estate is faltering.

“Our goal is to help communities succeed over the long term, and make sure that everyone has access to opportunity, whether or not they work in tech,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai

Results: Lendlease Group Delivered A Surprise Loss And Now Analysts Have New Forecasts

It's been a mediocre week for 
 (
) shareholders, with the stock dropping 15% to AU$6.20 in the week since its latest half-year results. Revenues came in well ahead of expectations at AU$4.8b, although statutory earnings per share fell badly short. Lendlease Group reported a loss of AU$0.20 per share, whereas the analysts had previously expected a profit. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results.
Taking into account the latest results, the consensus forecast from Lendlease Group's nine analysts is for revenues of AU$10.9b in 2024. This reflects a credible 7.3% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Earnings are expected to improve, with Lendlease Group forecast to report a statutory profit of AU$0.67 per share. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of AU$10.4b and earnings per share (EPS) of AU$0.82 in 2024. So it's pretty clear the analysts have mixed opinions on Lendlease Group after the latest results; even though they upped their revenue numbers, it came at the cost of a substantial drop in per-share earnings expectations.
The analysts also cut Lendlease Group's price target 11% to AU$7.98, implying that lower forecast earnings are expected to have a more negative impact than can be offset by the increase in revenue. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. There are some variant perceptions on Lendlease Group, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at AU$13.30 and the most bearish at AU$7.00 per share. This is a fairly broad spread of estimates, suggesting that analysts are forecasting a wide range of possible outcomes for the business.
Of course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the 
 itself. For example, we noticed that Lendlease Group's rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with revenues forecast to exhibit 15% growth to the end of 2024 on an annualised basis. That is well above its historical decline of 10% a year over the past five years. Compare this against analyst estimates for the broader industry, which suggest that (in aggregate) industry revenues are expected to grow 7.5% annually. So it looks like Lendlease Group is expected to grow faster than its competitors, at least for a while.
The most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results. Pleasantly, they also upgraded their revenue estimates, and their forecasts suggest the business is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. The consensus price target fell measurably, with the analysts seemingly not reassured by the latest results, leading to a lower estimate of Lendlease Group's future valuation.
Keeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider. We have forecasts for Lendlease Group going out to 2026, and you can 
However, before you get too enthused, we've discovered 
 that you should be aware of.

Lendlease Group's Dividend Analysis

Lendlease Group (
) recently announced a 
 of $0.07 per share, payable on 2024-03-13, with the ex-dividend date set for 2024-02-23. As investors look forward to this upcoming payment, the spotlight also shines on the company's dividend history, yield, and growth rates. Using the data from GuruFocus, let's look into Lendlease Group's dividend performance and assess its sustainability.
Lendlease's business comprises three segments: development, investments, and construction. Development accounted for more than half of EBITDA in 2020, and the future pipeline is so large it cannot be funded from its own balance sheet. The group is selling stakes in mature projects to its funds management clients. This sacrifices development profit, in return for management fees, reduced risk, and capital to accelerate new projects in the pipeline. Construction generates large revenues but slim margins. This business is retained to preserve expertise and scale for the development business. Lendlease sold its engineering and services business during the pandemic, but retains some risks, notably the Melbourne Metro project. It is also reducing its exposure to retirement living.
Lendlease Group has maintained a consistent 
 record since 2020. Dividends are currently distributed on a bi-annually basis. Below is a chart showing annual 
 for tracking historical trends.
As of today, Lendlease Group currently has a 12-month 
 of 2.25% and a 12-month 
 of 2.46%. This suggests an expectation of increased dividend payments over the next 12 months.
Over the past three years, Lendlease Group's annual

Based on Lendlease Group's dividend yield and five-year growth rate, the

To assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The 
 provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-06-30, Lendlease Group's dividend payout ratio is 0.00.
Lendlease Group's

To ensure the sustainability of dividends, a company must have robust growth metrics. Lendlease Group's

Revenue is the lifeblood of any company, and Lendlease Group's

The past three years for Lendlease Group (ASX:LLC) investors has not been profitable

In order to justify the effort of selecting individual stocks, it's worth striving to beat the returns from a market index fund. But the risk of stock picking is that you will likely buy under-performing companies. We regret to report that long term 
 (
) shareholders have had that experience, with the share price dropping 50% in three years, versus a market return of about 28%. Furthermore, it's down 12% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders.
So let's have a look and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.
Because Lendlease Group made a loss in the last twelve months, we think the market is probably more focussed on revenue and revenue growth, at least for now. Shareholders of unprofitable companies usually desire strong revenue growth. Some companies are willing to postpone profitability to grow revenue faster, but in that case one would hope for good top-line growth to make up for the lack of earnings.
In the last three years, Lendlease Group saw its revenue grow by 3.9% per year, compound. That's not a very high growth rate considering it doesn't make profits. It's likely this weak growth has contributed to an annualised return of 15% for the last three years. It can be well worth keeping an eye on growth stocks that disappoint the market, because sometimes they re-accelerate. After all, growing a business isn't easy, and the process will not always be smooth.
The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).
It's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Lendlease Group will 
.
As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Lendlease Group the TSR over the last 3 years was -48%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!
Investors in Lendlease Group had a tough year, with a total loss of 7.3% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 17%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. However, the loss over the last year isn't as bad as the 7% per annum loss investors have suffered over the last half decade. We'd need to see some sustained improvements in the key metrics before we could muster much enthusiasm. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 
 you should know about.

20 Biggest Real Estate and Property Companies in Australia, 2024

In this article, we will be covering the biggest real estate and property companies in Australia in 2024. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 
.
The national median home value in Australia was 
 to be at a record high of $774,000 in April. This price has increased by 6.6% since 2023. Due to soaring interest rates, the purchasing power of Australians has been cut by almost 35% to 40%. Due to stubbornly persisting inflation, no interest cuts have been expected for 2024 although two cuts had been forecasted early this year.
Although home buyers in Australia continue to be concerned about high interest rates, a fear of missing out prevails among buyers who have been pushed out of the market for long. More certainty related to the interest rates will determine how the buyers who await potential rate reductions will return to the market. On May 8, realestate.com.au 
 that the Australian property price growth might slow down since the Reserve Bank held the cash rate at its 12-year high of 4.35%. Amidst stronger-than-expected inflation in March, the optimism regarding an early interest rate cut has diminished. Since further rate hikes can also be undertaken due to inflation, slower price growth has been predicted through the winter months.
Although the number of homes going up for sale typically declines following Easter, 2024 has been different as scheduled auctions have gone up as compared to 2023. During the week from May 6 to May 12, 2,548 homes were scheduled for auction across the country which depicts a 43% increase from 1 year ago. Victoria records 1,158 homes for auction, up 55% year-over-year. New South Wales follows with 906 scheduled auctions, up 38% from a year ago.
Regardless of the high listings in Victoria and New South Wales, the same housing volumes have not been witnessed in South Australia and Western Australia which has driven high prices. Simultaneously, house prices have climbed 20% in Perth and 14% in Adelaide year-over-year while the housing stock remains low. Therefore, the Australian real estate market currently faces issues related to housing affordability and shortage while the interest rate scenario is not completely certain. You can also take a look at the

Lendlease Group (ASX:LLC) Shares Could Be 46% Below Their Intrinsic Value Estimate

How far off is Lendlease Group (
) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.
Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the 
.
We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:
 = AU$2.6b
After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 9.4%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$896m× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (9.4%– 2.2%) = AU$13b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$13b÷ ( 1 + 9.4%)
= AU$5.1b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is AU$7.7b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of AU$6.2, the company appears quite undervalued at a 46% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.
The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Lendlease Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.583. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to "what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For Lendlease Group, we've put together three pertinent factors you should further research:

Lendlease Quits International Construction to Free $2.98 Billion

The Australian real-estate developer plans to exit international construction amid what it called a prolonged market downturn, freeing $2.98 billion for capital returns, debt reduction and local growth.
================================================================================

With 54% ownership, Lendlease Group (ASX:LLC) boasts of strong institutional backing

To get a sense of who is truly in control of Lendlease Group (
), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 54% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).
Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.
Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Lendlease Group, beginning with the chart below.
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Lendlease Group. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Lendlease Group's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.
Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Lendlease Group is not owned by hedge funds. Aware Super Pty Ltd is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.7% of shares outstanding. With 7.2% and 6.3% of the shares outstanding respectively, State Street Global Advisors, Inc. and Orbis Investment Management Limited are the second and third largest shareholders.
A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 11 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.
Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.
Our information suggests that Lendlease Group insiders own under 1% of the company. However, it's possible that insiders might have an indirect interest through a more complex structure. It's a big company, so even a small proportional interest can create alignment between the board and shareholders. In this case insiders own AU$9.4m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking 
The general public-- including retail investors -- own 41% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.
We can see that Private Companies own 4.2%, of the shares on issue. It might be worth looking deeper into this. If related parties, such as insiders, have an interest in one of these private companies, that should be disclosed in the annual report. Private companies may also have a strategic interest in the company.
It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Lendlease Group better, we need to consider many other factors. Be aware that

Is There Now An Opportunity In Lendlease Group (ASX:LLC)?

Lendlease Group (
), might not be a large cap stock, but it saw significant share price movement during recent months on the ASX, rising to highs of AU$6.56 and falling to the lows of AU$5.37. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Lendlease Group's current trading price of AU$5.41 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Lendlease Group’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.
The stock is currently trading at AU$5.41 on the share market, which means it is overvalued by 28% compared to our intrinsic value of A$4.22. This means that the opportunity to buy Lendlease Group at a good price has disappeared! Furthermore, Lendlease Group’s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. If you believe the share price should eventually reach its true value, a low beta could suggest it is unlikely to rapidly do so anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range.
Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Though in the case of Lendlease Group, it is expected to deliver a highly negative revenue growth over the next few years, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. It appears that risk of future uncertainty is high, at least in the near term.
 If you believe LLC is currently trading above its value, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. Given the risk from a negative growth outlook, this could be the right time to reduce your total portfolio risk. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.
 If you’ve been keeping tabs on LLC for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. Its price has risen beyond its true value, on top of a negative future outlook. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management. Should the price fall in the future, will you be well-informed enough to buy?
So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 
 you should know about.

Lendlease to sell US East Coast construction business to Consigli

Construction company Lendlease Group has confirmed terms with Consigli Construction for the sale of its US East Coast construction operations.
The deal, which is subject to customary due diligence and finalisation of documents, will see Consigli acquiring about 45 of Lendlease's ongoing, contracted, and preconstruction projects.
The majority of Lendlease’s US construction workforce is expected to transition to Consigli because of the sale.
As detailed during Lendlease's Strategy Update on 27 May 2024, this sale aligns with the company’s goal of divesting its construction operations in the US and UK within the next 18 months.
The decision is anticipated to lead to the impairment of related goodwill and deferred tax assets.
It is further expected to reduce Lendlease’s risk profile.
Lendlease CEO Tony Lombardo said: “Today’s announcement represents another step to simplify Lendlease to create a more focussed company for security holders. It’s the culmination of more than 12 months’ work refining our US construction activities to focus on the US East Coast where we have a clear competitive advantage.
“The sale represents a great outcome for both our people, the majority of whom will move across to Consigli, and for our customers.”
The specific terms of the contract are being kept confidential until the completion of the transaction, which is expected in the first half (H1) of financial year 2025.
Last year, Lendlease, in a joint venture with Birmingham City Council, 
 for the £1.9bn ($2.41bn) revitalisation of the Smithfield Market site in Birmingham's city centre, UK.
The plan features 1.3 million square feet of retail and workspace, homes, and two public squares - a Festival Square and Market Square.

Bullish Lendlease Group Insiders Loaded Up On AU$1.55m Of Stock

Usually, when one insider buys stock, it might not be a monumental event. But when multiple insiders are buying like they did in the case of 
 (
), that sends out a positive message to the company's shareholders.
Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.
The Independent Non-Executive Director David Craig made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for AU$450k worth of shares at a price of AU$5.41 each. We do like to see buying, but this purchase was made at well below the current price of AU$6.12. Because the shares were purchased at a lower price, this particular buy doesn't tell us much about how insiders feel about the current share price.
Happily, we note that in the last year insiders paid AU$1.5m for 250.13k shares. But insiders sold 83.13k shares worth AU$450k. Overall, Lendlease Group insiders were net buyers during the last year. They paid about AU$6.19 on average. These transactions suggest that insiders have considered the current price attractive. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!
Lendlease Group is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find 
 this 
 
At Lendlease Group,over the last quarter, we have observed quite a lot more insider buying than insider selling. Insiders spent AU$832k on shares. On the other hand, Independent Non-Executive Director David Craig netted AU$450k by selling. The buying outweighs the selling, which suggests that insiders may believe the company will do well in the future.
I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders.
