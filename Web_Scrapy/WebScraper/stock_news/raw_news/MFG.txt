Institutions along with retail investors who hold considerable shares inMagellan Financial Group Limited (ASX:MFG) come under pressure; lose 5.9% of holdings value 2023-09-01T01:31:36.000Z

A look at the shareholders of Magellan Financial Group Limited (
) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 51% to be precise, is retail investors. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
Following a 5.9% decrease in the stock price last week, retail investors suffered the most losses, but institutions who own 43% stock also took a hit.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Magellan Financial Group.
Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.
Magellan Financial Group already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Magellan Financial Group, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.
Hedge funds don't have many shares in Magellan Financial Group. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.2% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 4.9% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.7% by the third-largest shareholder.
A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.
Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
We can see that insiders own shares in Magellan Financial Group Limited. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth AU$50m. Most would see this as a real positive. If you would like to explore the question of insider alignment, you can 
The general public -- including retail investors -- own 51% of Magellan Financial Group. This level of ownership gives investors from the wider public some power to sway key policy decisions such as board composition, executive compensation, and the dividend payout ratio.
It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Magellan Financial Group better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted 
 you should be aware of, and 1 of them is significant.
If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check

Australia's Magellan plunges as fund manager sees decline in assets managed for 8th month 2023-10-06T03:33:37.000Z

(Reuters) - Shares of Australian fund manager Magellan Financial Group fell over 17% on Friday to hit a more than decade low, as its assets under management declined for an eighth consecutive month.
The declines in funds managed, mainly in global equities strategy, come at a time when global equity markets are going through a period of volatility as central banks maintain their hawkish stance.
U.S. economic data has been mixed lately, though markets have been especially wary that signs of resilience could justify the Federal Reserve holding interest rates elevated for longer or even hike them further.
Magellan's total funds under management (FUM) have declined to A$35.0 billion ($22.31 billion) as at September 29, an A$4.0 billion decline since the end of August, with global equities seeing the biggest exodus, declining to A$15.3 billion from A$18.6 billion.
The fund manager's shares hit A$7.270, their lowest since May 2013, and marked their worst intraday daily loss since December 2021.
The Sydney-based firm was the biggest loser in the ASX 200 benchmark index, with more than 4.5 million shares changing hands, over four times the 30-day average volume of 1 million.
Magellan's net outflows for September were A$2.0 billion, with institutional outflows making up the most of it with A$1.7 billion outflows.
Its total FUM has declined for eight out of nine months this year, and is down 22.7% from the end of last year.

Investors in Magellan Financial Group (ASX:MFG) have unfortunately lost 86% over the last three years 2023-10-16T02:15:59.000Z

As an investor, mistakes are inevitable. But you want to avoid the really big losses like the plague. So take a moment to sympathize with the long term shareholders of 
 (
), who have seen the share price tank a massive 89% over a three year period. That might cause some serious doubts about the merits of the initial decision to buy the stock, to put it mildly. And over the last year the share price fell 38%, so we doubt many shareholders are delighted. Even worse, it's down 28% in about a month, which isn't fun at all. We really feel for shareholders in this scenario. It's a good reminder of the importance of diversification, and it's worth keeping in mind there's more to life than money, anyway.
Since shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns.
To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.
Magellan Financial Group saw its EPS decline at a compound rate of 23% per year, over the last three years. This reduction in EPS is slower than the 52% annual reduction in the share price. So it's likely that the EPS decline has disappointed the market, leaving investors hesitant to buy. This increased caution is also evident in the rather low P/E ratio, which is sitting at 6.78.
The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).
Dive deeper into Magellan Financial Group's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Magellan Financial Group's 
.
When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between 
 (TSR) and 
. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Magellan Financial Group, it has a TSR of -86% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!
Magellan Financial Group shareholders are down 30% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 8.2%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 10% per year over five years. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should "buy when there is blood on the streets", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted 
 you should be aware of, and 1 of them doesn't sit too well with us.

Executive Chairman of Magellan Financial Group Andrew Formica Buys More Stock 2023-11-04T22:00:23.000Z

Potential 
 (
) shareholders may wish to note that the Executive Chairman, Andrew Formica, recently bought AU$250k worth of stock, paying AU$6.24 for each share. However, it only increased shareholding by a small percentage, and it wasn't a huge purchase by absolute value, either.
Notably, that recent purchase by Andrew Formica is the biggest insider purchase of Magellan Financial Group shares that we've seen in the last year. Even though the purchase was made at a significantly lower price than the recent price (AU$6.95), we still think insider buying is a positive. While it does suggest insiders consider the stock undervalued at lower prices, this transaction doesn't tell us much about what they think of current prices.
Magellan Financial Group insiders may have bought shares in the last year, but they didn't sell any. They paid about AU$3.84 on average. It is certainly positive to see that insiders have invested their own money in the company. However, we do note that they were buying at significantly lower prices than today's share price. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!
There are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. So if that suits your style you could check each stock one by one or you could take a look at this 
 
Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It appears that Magellan Financial Group insiders own 3.1% of the company, worth about AU$40m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.
It is good to see recent purchasing. And an analysis of the transactions over the last year also gives us confidence. When combined with notable insider ownership, these factors suggest Magellan Financial Group insiders are well aligned, and that they may think the share price is too low. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Be aware that

Institutions own 40% of Magellan Financial Group Limited (ASX:MFG) shares but individual investors control 54% of the company 2024-02-08T01:50:31.000Z

To get a sense of who is truly in control of Magellan Financial Group Limited (
), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are individual investors with 54% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
Institutions, on the other hand, account for 40% of the company's stockholders. Institutions often own shares in more established companies, while it's not unusual to see insiders own a fair bit of smaller companies.
Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Magellan Financial Group, beginning with the chart below.
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
Magellan Financial Group already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Magellan Financial Group's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.
We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Magellan Financial Group. The company's largest shareholder is BlackRock, Inc., with ownership of 8.2%. With 4.9% and 4.7% of the shares outstanding respectively, UBS Asset Management AG and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.
Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.
While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.
Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Magellan Financial Group Limited. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth AU$52m. Most would see this as a real positive. If you would like to explore the question of insider alignment, you can 
The general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, collectively holds 54% of Magellan Financial Group shares. With this amount of ownership, retail investors can collectively play a role in decisions that affect shareholder returns, such as dividend policies and the appointment of directors. They can also exercise the power to vote on acquisitions or mergers that may not improve profitability.
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted 
 you should be aware of, and 1 of them can't be ignored.

We Wouldn't Be Too Quick To Buy Magellan Financial Group Limited (ASX:MFG) Before It Goes Ex-Dividend 2024-02-17T22:35:50.000Z

 (
) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next two days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Magellan Financial Group's shares before the 20th of February to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 6th of March.
The company's next dividend payment will be AU$0.294 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of AU$0.59 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Magellan Financial Group stock has a trailing yield of around 6.2% on the current share price of AU$9.42. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Magellan Financial Group's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing.
If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Magellan Financial Group is paying out an acceptable 58% of its profit, a common payout level among most companies.
When a company paid out less in dividends than it earned in profit, this generally suggests its dividend is affordable. The lower the % of its profit that it pays out, the greater the margin of safety for the dividend if the business enters a downturn.
Click 
Companies that aren't growing their earnings can still be valuable, but it is even more important to assess the sustainability of the dividend if it looks like the company will struggle to grow. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. With that in mind, we're not enthused to see that Magellan Financial Group's earnings per share have remained effectively flat over the past five years. It's better than seeing them drop, certainly, but over the long term, all of the best dividend stocks are able to meaningfully grow their earnings per share.
Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Magellan Financial Group has lifted its dividend by approximately 19% a year on average.
Is Magellan Financial Group an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Earnings per share have not grown at all, and the company pays out a bit over half its profits to shareholders. These characteristics don't generally lead to outstanding dividend performance, and investors may not be happy with the results of owning this stock for its dividend.
With that in mind though, if the poor dividend characteristics of Magellan Financial Group don't faze you, it's worth being mindful of the risks involved with this business. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 
 (of which 1 is potentially serious!) you should know about.
Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's

Magellan Financial Group Ltd's Dividend Analysis 2024-02-19T10:08:19.000Z

Magellan Financial Group Ltd (
) recently announced a 
 of $0.29 per share, payable on 2024-03-06, with the ex-dividend date set for 2024-02-20. As investors look forward to this upcoming payment, the spotlight also shines on the company's dividend history, yield, and growth rates. Using the data from GuruFocus, let's look into Magellan Financial Group Ltd's dividend performance and assess its sustainability.
Magellan Financial Group is an Australia-based niche funds manager. Established in 2006, the firm specializes in the management of equity and infrastructure funds for domestic retail and institutional investors. Magellan has historically been particularly successful in winning mandates from global institutional investors. Current FUM is split across global equities, infrastructure and Australian equities.
Magellan Financial Group Ltd has maintained a consistent 
 record since 2019. Dividends are currently distributed on a bi-annual basis. Below is a chart showing annual 
 for tracking historical trends.
As of today, Magellan Financial Group Ltd currently has a 12-month 
 of 8.77% and a 12-month 
 of 5.91%. This suggests an expectation of decreased dividend payments over the next 12 months.
Over the past three years, Magellan Financial Group Ltd's annual 
 was -17.20%. Extended to a five-year horizon, this rate increased to 6.40% per year. And over the past decade, Magellan Financial Group Ltd's annual dividends per share growth rate stands at an impressive 28.30%.
Based on Magellan Financial Group Ltd's dividend yield and five-year growth rate, the 
 of Magellan Financial Group Ltd stock as of today is approximately 11.96%.
To assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The 
 provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-06-30, Magellan Financial Group Ltd's dividend payout ratio is 1.16, which may suggest that the company's dividend may not be sustainable.
Magellan Financial Group Ltd's 
, offers an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers. GuruFocus ranks Magellan Financial Group Ltd's profitability 4 out of 10 as of 2023-06-30, suggesting the dividend may not be sustainable. The company has reported positive 
 for each year over the past decade, further solidifying its high profitability.
To ensure the sustainability of dividends, a company must have robust growth metrics. Magellan Financial Group Ltd's 
 of 4 out of 10 suggests that the company has poor growth prospects and thus, the dividend may not be sustainable.
Revenue is the lifeblood of any company, and Magellan Financial Group Ltd's 
, combined with the 
, indicates a strong revenue model. Magellan Financial Group Ltd's revenue has increased by approximately -15.10% per year on average, a rate that underperforms than approximately 73.53% of global competitors.
The company's 
 showcases its capability to grow its earnings, a critical component for sustaining dividends in the long run. During the past three years, Magellan Financial Group Ltd's earnings increased by approximately -26.60% per year on average, a rate that underperforms than approximately 80.09% of global competitors.
Lastly, the company's 
 of -6.50%, which underperforms than approximately 80.06% of global competitors.
In conclusion, while Magellan Financial Group Ltd offers an attractive dividend yield and has a history of consistent dividend payments, the company's negative growth rates and low profitability rank raise concerns about the sustainability of its dividends. The high dividend payout ratio further intensifies these concerns, suggesting that Magellan Financial Group may need to reassess its dividend policy in alignment with its earnings and growth prospects. Investors should closely monitor the company's financial health and future earnings reports to make informed decisions regarding their investment in Magellan Financial Group Ltd.

Magellan Financial Group (ASX:MFG) earnings and shareholder returns have been trending downwards for the last three years, but the stock increases 7.8% this past week 2024-03-24T22:00:32.000Z

 (
) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 20% in the last month. But that is meagre solace in the face of the shocking decline over three years. In that time the share price has melted like a snowball in the desert, down 77%. So we're relieved for long term holders to see a bit of uplift. Only time will tell if the company can sustain the turnaround.
While the stock has risen 7.8% in the past week but long term shareholders are still in the red, let's see what the fundamentals can tell us.
To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.
Magellan Financial Group saw its EPS decline at a compound rate of 20% per year, over the last three years. This reduction in EPS is slower than the 39% annual reduction in the share price. So it's likely that the EPS decline has disappointed the market, leaving investors hesitant to buy. The less favorable sentiment is reflected in its current P/E ratio of 9.20.
The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).
We consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of 
.
When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between 
 (TSR) and 
. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Magellan Financial Group, it has a TSR of -70% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the 
 shareholder return.
We're pleased to report that Magellan Financial Group shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 39% over one year. That's including the dividend. Notably the five-year annualised TSR loss of 10% per year compares very unfavourably with the recent share price performance. We generally put more weight on the long term performance over the short term, but the recent improvement could hint at a (positive) inflection point within the business. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should learn about the

Pleasing Signs As A Number Of Insiders Buy Magellan Financial Group Stock 2024-04-21T22:18:36.000Z

It is usually uneventful when a single insider buys stock. However, When quite a few insiders buy shares, as it happened in 
 (
) case, it's fantastic news for shareholders.
While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.
In the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Executive Chairman Andrew Formica bought AU$250k worth of shares at a price of AU$6.24 per share. We do like to see buying, but this purchase was made at well below the current price of AU$8.72. Because it occurred at a lower valuation, it doesn't tell us much about whether insiders might find today's price attractive.
While Magellan Financial Group insiders bought shares during the last year, they didn't sell. They paid about AU$4.21 on average. We don't deny that it is nice to see insiders buying stock in the company. But we must note that the investments were made at well below today's share price. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!
There are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. So if that suits your style you could check each stock one by one or you could take a look at this 
 
There was some insider buying at Magellan Financial Group over the last quarter. Independent Non-Executive Director Deborah Page shelled out AU$50k for shares in that time. It's great to see that insiders are only buying, not selling. But in this case the amount purchased means the recent transaction may not be very meaningful on its own.
Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Magellan Financial Group insiders own about AU$50m worth of shares. That equates to 3.2% of the company. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.
It is good to see the recent insider purchase. And an analysis of the transactions over the last year also gives us confidence. Given that insiders also own a fair bit of Magellan Financial Group we think they are probably pretty confident of a bright future. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Magellan Financial Group. Case in point: We've spotted

While institutions own 41% of Magellan Financial Group Limited (ASX:MFG), individual investors are its largest shareholders with 53% ownership 2024-07-17T02:46:39.000Z

Institutions along with retail investors who hold considerable shares inMagellan Financial Group Limited (ASX:MFG) come under pressure; lose 5.9% of holdings value 2023-09-01T01:31:36.000Z

A look at the shareholders of Magellan Financial Group Limited (
) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 51% to be precise, is retail investors. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
Following a 5.9% decrease in the stock price last week, retail investors suffered the most losses, but institutions who own 43% stock also took a hit.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Magellan Financial Group.
Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.
Magellan Financial Group already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Magellan Financial Group, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.
Hedge funds don't have many shares in Magellan Financial Group. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.2% of shares outstanding.
