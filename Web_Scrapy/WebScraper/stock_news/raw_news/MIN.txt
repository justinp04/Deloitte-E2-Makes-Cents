Are Investors Undervaluing Mineral Resources Limited (ASX:MIN) By 35%?

Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Mineral Resources Limited (
) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.
Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the 
 may be something of interest to you.
We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:
 = AU$5.6b
The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.3%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.3%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$1.9b× (1 + 2.3%) ÷ (8.3%– 2.3%) = AU$32b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$32b÷ ( 1 + 8.3%)
= AU$14b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is AU$20b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of AU$66.5, the company appears quite undervalued at a 35% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.
We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Mineral Resources as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.317. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to "what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For Mineral Resources, we've put together three fundamental factors you should explore:
PS. Simply Wall St updates its DCF calculation for every Australian stock every day, so if you want to find the intrinsic value of any other stock just

Are Investors Undervaluing Mineral Resources Limited (ASX:MIN) By 35%?

Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Mineral Resources Limited (
) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.
Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the 
 may be something of interest to you.
We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:
 = AU$5.6b
The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.3%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.3%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$1.9b× (1 + 2.3%) ÷ (8.3%– 2.3%) = AU$32b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$32b÷ ( 1 + 8.3%)
= AU$14b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is AU$20b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of AU$66.5, the company appears quite undervalued at a 35% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.
We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Mineral Resources as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.317. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to "what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For Mineral Resources, we've put together three fundamental factors you should explore:

ASX Stocks Estimated To Be Below Intrinsic Value In June 2024

As the Australian market shows modest gains with the ASX200 closing up 0.1% this week, investor focus may shift towards sectors that have underperformed or outperformed, such as Materials and IT respectively. In such a mixed economic landscape, identifying stocks that are potentially undervalued becomes crucial, especially when considering long-term growth prospects in fluctuating markets.
Let's uncover some gems from our specialized screener
 Mineral Resources Limited is a mining services company operating in Australia, Asia, and internationally, with a market capitalization of approximately A$10.52 billion.

Despite this growth potential and a forecasted high return on equity of 25.8%, concerns arise from its profit margins dropping to 7.9% from last year’s 16.3%, coupled with inadequate coverage of interest payments by earnings.

The company's revenue and earnings are expected to grow at 37.8% and 36.69% per year respectively, significantly outperforming the Australian market averages of 5.4% and 13.8%. However, investor caution may be warranted due to recent significant insider selling and shareholder dilution over the past year.
 Viva Energy Group Limited is an energy company operating in Australia, Singapore, and Papua New Guinea with a market capitalization of approximately A$5.00 billion.
 The company generates revenue through three primary segments: Convenience & Mobility at A$10.10 billion, Commercial & Industrial at A$16.64 billion, and Energy & Infrastructure at A$7.32 billion.

Viva Energy Group, priced at A$3.15, is considered undervalued by 17.1%, with a fair value estimated at A$3.8 based on discounted cash flow analysis. Despite recent index changes and not being covered well by earnings or cash flows, its dividend stands at 4.51%.
