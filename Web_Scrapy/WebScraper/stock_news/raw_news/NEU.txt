Neuren Phase 2 trial shows significant improvements in Phelan-McDermid syndrome 2023-12-18T11:00:00.000Z

, 
 /PRNewswire/ -- Neuren Pharmaceuticals (ASX: NEU) today announced top-line results from its Phase 2 clinical trial of NNZ-2591 in children with Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS). Significant improvement was observed by both clinicians and caregivers from treatment, across multiple efficacy measures. Improvements were consistently seen across many of the core PMS characteristics. PMS has severe quality of life impacts for those living with the syndrome, as well as parents and siblings. There are no approved treatments for PMS despite its severely debilitating impact.
Neuren CEO 
 commented "The strength and consistency of these results has exceeded our expectations and gives us high confidence as we strive to accelerate the development of a potential first therapy to address the overwhelming unmet medical need of PMS.  We are very grateful to all the people at the trial sites in 
 and in the PMS community who enabled this groundbreaking trial to be completed successfully."
Elizabeth Berry-Kravis, MD, PhD, Professor Department of Pediatrics at 
 Medical Center in 
 and an Investigator in the study, commented: "Although the Phase 2 trial was an open label study, I am very encouraged that both clinicians and caregivers observed pervasive improvements across multiple, clinically important features of PMS including communication, cognition, learning, socialisation and behaviour.  Improvements typically considered clinically meaningful were achieved in the clinician rated CGI-I as well as the caregiver rated CIC. I look forward to seeing this program advance to the next stage of development for the PMS community".
The open label Phase 2 trial in up to 20 children aged 3 to 12 years at four hospitals in 
 examined safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy over 13 weeks of treatment with NNZ2591. NNZ-2591 was administered to all subjects as an oral liquid dose twice daily, with escalation in two stages up to the target dose of 12 mg/kg during the first 6 weeks of treatment, subject to independent review of safety and tolerability data. The study commenced with at least 4 weeks of screening and observation to thoroughly examine baseline characteristics prior to treatment, followed by the treatment period of 13 weeks. A follow-up assessment was made 2 weeks after the end of treatment. 23 children were screened, 5 failed screening and 18 entered the study. The mean age was 8.6 years.
The primary endpoints of this first trial in children were safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics. Secondary endpoints included 14 efficacy measures assessed by clinicians and by caregivers. Efficacy measures included global measures assessing overall change, measures assessing specific symptom areas and measures assessing quality of life.
NNZ-2591 was well tolerated and demonstrated a good safety profile. Most Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) were mild to moderate. There was only one Serious TEAE (gastroenteritis), which was not related to study drug and occurred during the safety follow-up period after end of treatment. Three subjects discontinued due to TEAEs, two testing positive for COVID-19 and one due to seizures that were not related to study drug. No clinically significant changes in laboratory values, electrocardiogram (ECG) or other safety parameters were observed during treatment.
Improvement from baseline on overall/total scores was statistically significant (Wilcoxon signed rank test p<0.05) for 10 out of 14 efficacy endpoints.
The results for the global measures rated by both clinicians and caregivers showed a level of improvement typically considered clinically meaningful. 16 out of 18 children showed improvement measured by the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I), an assessment by the clinician of the child's overall status compared with baseline. The mean CGI-I score was 2.4. 10 children received a score of either 1 ("very much improved") or 2 ("much improved").
15 out of 18 children showed improvement measured by the Caregiver Overall Impression of Change (CIC), an assessment by the caregiver of the child's overall status compared with baseline. The mean CIC score was 2.7.  Seven children received a score of either 1 ("very much improved") or 2 ("much improved").
Neuren is also conducting Phase 2 clinical trials of NNZ-2591 in children with three other neurodevelopmental disorders – Pitt Hopkins syndrome, Angelman syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome. Top-line results from the Pitt Hopkins syndrome trial are expected in Q2 2024. All four programs have been granted Orphan Drug designation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are being developed under Investigational New Drug (IND) applications. Each syndrome is a seriously debilitating neurological disorder that emerges in early childhood and has no or limited approved treatment options.
Detailed results are available in the full announcement: 
Phelan-McDermid syndrome is caused by a deletion or other change in the 22q13 region of chromosome 22, which includes the 
 gene, or a mutation of the gene. PMS is also known as 22q13 deletion syndrome. The 
gene codes for the shank3 protein, which supports the structure of synapses between nerve cells in the brain. It is estimated that between 1 in 8,000 and 1 in 15,000 people have PMS. There are no medications, drugs, or therapies specifically for PMS, which has an overwhelming unmet medical need.
PMS has severe quality of life impacts on those living with it, as well as on parents and siblings. The most common characteristics are moderate to severe developmental and intellectual impairment and developmental delay, delayed or absent speech, symptoms of autism, low muscle tone, motor delays, mild to severe epilepsy, difficulties with toilet training and problems with eating.
Further information about PMS is available at: 
Neuren is developing new drug therapies to treat multiple serious neurological disorders that emerge in early childhood and have no or limited approved treatment options. Recognising the urgent unmet need, all programs have been granted "orphan drug" designation in 
. Orphan drug designation provides incentives to encourage development of therapies for rare and serious diseases.
DAYBUE™ (trofinetide) is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of Rett syndrome in adult and pediatric patients two years of age and older. Neuren has granted an exclusive worldwide licence to Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. for the development and commercialisation of trofinetide.
Neuren's second drug candidate, NNZ-2591 is in Phase 2 development for each of Phelan-McDermid syndrome, Angelman syndrome, Pitt Hopkins syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome.

An Intrinsic Calculation For Neuren Pharmaceuticals Limited (ASX:NEU) Suggests It's 44% Undervalued 2023-12-26T21:15:45.000Z

Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Neuren Pharmaceuticals Limited (ASX:NEU) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!
Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the 
 may be something of interest to you.
We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:
 = AU$1.4b
After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.1%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$289m× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.1%– 2.1%) = AU$7.4b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$7.4b÷ ( 1 + 6.1%)
= AU$4.1b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is AU$5.5b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of AU$24.0, the company appears quite undervalued at a 44% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.
We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Neuren Pharmaceuticals as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to "what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For Neuren Pharmaceuticals, we've compiled three fundamental aspects you should look at:

Are Robust Financials Driving The Recent Rally In Neuren Pharmaceuticals Limited's (ASX:NEU) Stock? 2024-03-01T22:21:22.000Z

Most readers would already be aware that Neuren Pharmaceuticals' (ASX:NEU) stock increased significantly by 22% over the past three months. Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on 
 ROE.
Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Neuren Pharmaceuticals is:
77% = AU$157m ÷ AU$205m (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).
The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every A$1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated A$0.77 in profit.
So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or "retains" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.
Firstly, we acknowledge that Neuren Pharmaceuticals has a significantly high ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 21% the company's ROE is quite impressive. As a result, Neuren Pharmaceuticals' exceptional 77% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise.
We then compared Neuren Pharmaceuticals' net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 34% in the same 5-year period.
Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. If you're wondering about Neuren Pharmaceuticals''s valuation, check out 
, as compared to its industry.
Neuren Pharmaceuticals doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.
On the whole, we feel that Neuren Pharmaceuticals' performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

Neuren Phase 2 trial shows significant improvements in Pitt Hopkins syndrome 2024-05-27T10:00:00.000Z

, 
 /PRNewswire/ -- Neuren Pharmaceuticals (ASX: NEU) today announced top-line results from its Phase 2 clinical trial of NNZ-2591 in children with Pitt Hopkins syndrome (PTHS). Statistically significant improvement from baseline was observed by both clinicians and caregivers from treatment, across all 4 efficacy measures that were specifically designed to assess the core characteristics of PTHS. There are no approved treatments for PTHS despite its severely debilitating impact on the lives of patients, as well as their parents and siblings.
Neuren CEO 
 commented "We are very excited about the results of this first clinical trial in Pitt Hopkins patients. This underserved community has such urgent unmet need and we can now continue towards our goal of developing a first approved treatment. We are very grateful to the people in the Pitt Hopkins community and at the trial sites in 
 who enabled the successful completion of this extremely challenging, but groundbreaking trial."
, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Neurology and Pediatrics at the 
, and Director, Brain Development Research Program was an investigator in the trial. Dr Sherr commented: "I am optimistic about the results in the PTHS specific measures. The mechanism of action of NNZ-2591 supports this response seen in PTHS and its potential in other highly impactful neurodevelopmental disorders."
Dr. 
, Neuren Vice President of Clinical Development commented: "The consistent results on the PTHS specific assessments affirm the need for syndrome specific measurements in severe neurodevelopmental disorders where measures that were developed for broader populations may not be as appropriate. Neuren appreciates the collaboration of Dr. 
, Associate Professor at the 
 (an investigator in the trial), the Pitt-Hopkins Research Foundation, and others who contributed to the development of these important measures."
The open label Phase 2 trial in 16 children aged 3 to 17 years (mean age 9 years) at five hospitals in 
 examined safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy over 13 weeks of treatment with NNZ-2591. NNZ-2591 was administered to all subjects as an oral liquid dose twice daily, with escalation in two stages up to the target dose of 12 mg/kg during the first 6 weeks of treatment, subject to independent review of safety and tolerability data. The study commenced with at least 4 weeks of screening and observation to thoroughly define baseline characteristics prior to treatment, followed by the treatment period of 13 weeks. A follow-up assessment was made 2 weeks after the end of treatment.
The primary endpoints of this first trial in children with PTHS were safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics. Secondary endpoints included four efficacy measures specifically designed for PTHS assessed by clinicians and by caregivers, as well as ten efficacy measures that were not designed for use in PTHS but have been used in other neurodevelopmental conditions.
NNZ-2591 was well tolerated and demonstrated a good safety profile. All Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) were mild to moderate and most were considered not related to study drug. There were no Serious TEAEs and no meaningful trends in laboratory values, electrocardiogram (ECG) or other safety parameters were observed during treatment. 
11 subjects completed the trial. One subject discontinued because they were unable to complete the safety monitoring procedures required by the study protocol. Four subjects discontinued due to TEAEs, all of which resolved.  For two of those subjects the TEAEs (COVID-19 and mild vomiting/diarrhea/lethargy) were considered not related to study drug and for two subjects the TEAEs (moderate constipation/self-injury/abdominal distention/fatigue and mild sleep disorder/constipation) were considered related to study drug.
The mean improvement from baseline was statistically significant (Wilcoxon signed rank test p<0.05) for each of the four efficacy measures that were specifically designed for Pitt Hopkins syndrome, whether calculated for the subjects that completed the study (n=11), or including discontinued subjects (n=15).
Changes from baseline were not statistically significant for the efficacy measures that were not designed for use in PTHS but have been used in other neurodevelopmental conditions.
The results for the global measures rated by both clinicians and caregivers showed a level of improvement considered clinically meaningful. 9 out of 11 children that completed the trial showed improvement measured by the PTHS Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I), an assessment by the clinician of the child's overall status compared with baseline. The mean CGI-I score was 2.6. Five children received a score of either 1 ("very much improved") or 2 ("much improved").
8 out of 11 children that completed the trial showed improvement measured by the PTHS Caregiver Overall Impression of Change (CIC), an assessment by the caregiver of the child's overall status compared with baseline. The mean CIC score was 3.0. Four children received a score of 2 ("much improved"). 
6 out of 11 children that completed the trial showed improvement measured by the PTHS Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S), an assessment by the clinician of the child's overall severity of illness, compared with the assessment at baseline. The CGI-S score improved from 6 to 5 for 3 children and from 5 to 4 for 3 children.
8 out of 11 children that completed the trial showed improvement measured by the Caregiver Top 3 Concerns overall score, an individualised assessment by the caregiver of their child's most concerning symptoms. Language/Communication was the most commonly chosen concern.
Detailed results are available in the full announcement and investor presentation:
Pitt Hopkins syndrome (PTHS) is a neurodevelopmental condition caused by the loss of one copy or a mutation of the TCF4 gene on chromosome 18. The incidence of PTHS has been estimated at between 1 in 34,000 and 1 in 41,000 people. Characteristics of PTHS are a range of developmental delay with moderate-to-severe intellectual disability and behavioral differences, hyperventilation and/or breath-holding while awake, seizures, gastrointestinal issues, lack of speech, sleep disturbance, stereotypic hand movements and distinctive facial features. Some individuals with PTHS are diagnosed with autism.  Further information about PTHS is available at:

Are Investors Undervaluing Neuren Pharmaceuticals Limited (ASX:NEU) By 46%? 2024-06-03T22:06:37.000Z

In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Neuren Pharmaceuticals Limited (
) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.
Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the 
.
We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period.

We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:
 = AU$1.3b
We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.3%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 5.9%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$225m× (1 + 2.3%) ÷ (5.9%– 2.3%) = AU$6.3b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$6.3b÷ ( 1 + 5.9%)
= AU$3.5b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is AU$4.8b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of AU$20.3, the company appears quite good value at a 46% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.
Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance.

The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to "what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?
