Is New Hope Corporation Limited's (ASX:NHC) Stock's Recent Performance Being Led By Its Attractive Financial Prospects? 2023-09-26T20:55:25.000Z

New Hope's (ASX:NHC) stock is up by a considerable 28% over the past three months. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Particularly, we will be paying attention to 
 ROE today.
Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for New Hope is:
43% = AU$1.1b ÷ AU$2.5b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).
The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every A$1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn A$0.43 in profit.
So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or "retains", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.
First thing first, we like that New Hope has an impressive ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 24% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Under the circumstances, New Hope's considerable five year net income growth of 48% was to be expected.
We then compared New Hope's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 38% in the same 5-year period.
Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for NHC? You can find out in
New Hope's three-year median payout ratio is a pretty moderate 40%, meaning the company retains 60% of its income. So it seems that New Hope is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees impressive growth in its earnings (discussed above) and pays a dividend that's well covered.
Besides, New Hope has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 58% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected increase in the payout ratio explains the expected decline in the company's ROE to 19%, over the same period.
On the whole, we feel that New Hope's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future.

Investing in New Hope (ASX:NHC) three years ago would have delivered you a 598% gain 2023-10-12T03:32:16.000Z

For us, stock picking is in large part the hunt for the truly magnificent stocks. Not every pick can be a winner, but when you pick the right stock, you 
 win big. For example, the 
 (
) share price is up a whopping 420% in the last three years, a handsome return for long term holders. It's also good to see the share price up 34% over the last quarter. This could be related to the recent financial results, released recently - you can catch up on the most recent data by reading 
.
So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.
To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.
During three years of share price growth, New Hope moved from a loss to profitability. That kind of transition can be an inflection point that justifies a strong share price gain, just as we have seen here.
The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).
It's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of New Hope's 
.
It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for New Hope the TSR over the last 3 years was 598%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the 
 shareholder return.
New Hope provided a TSR of 11% over the year (including dividends). That's fairly close to the broader market return. It has to be noted that the recent return falls short of the 22% shareholders have gained each year, over half a decade. More recently, the share price growth has slowed. But it has to be said the overall picture is one of good long term and short term performance. Arguably that makes New Hope a stock worth watching. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified 
 that you should be aware of.
New Hope is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this

Insider Stock Buying Reaches AU$7.04m On New Hope 2023-11-22T21:10:36.000Z

Quite a few insiders have dramatically grown their holdings in 
 (
) over the past 12 months. An insider's optimism about the company's prospects is a positive sign.
While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.
In the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Non-Executive Chairman Robert Millner bought AU$1.7m worth of shares at a price of AU$5.62 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, even at a higher price than the current share price (being AU$5.30). It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock if insiders have bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price.
New Hope insiders may have bought shares in the last year, but they didn't sell any. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!
There are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. So if that suits your style you could check each stock one by one or you could take a look at this 
 
It's good to see that New Hope insiders have made notable investments in the company's shares. In total, insiders bought AU$1.3m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any sales whatsoever. This could be interpreted as suggesting a positive outlook.
I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It appears that New Hope insiders own 1.5% of the company, worth about AU$66m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.
The recent insider purchases are heartening. We also take confidence from the longer term picture of insider transactions. Insiders likely see value in New Hope shares, given these transactions (along with notable insider ownership of the company). While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. To help with this, we've discovered 
 (1 shouldn't be ignored!) that you ought to be aware of before buying any shares in New Hope.

Here's Why New Hope (ASX:NHC) Has Caught The Eye Of Investors 2024-01-17T23:23:32.000Z

Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. But as Peter Lynch said in 
, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.
In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like 
 (ASX:NHC), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.
New Hope has undergone a massive growth in earnings per share over the last three years. So much so that this three year growth rate wouldn't be a fair assessment of the company's future. As a result, we'll zoom in on growth over the last year, instead. Over the last year, New Hope increased its EPS from AU$1.18 to AU$1.29. That's a fair increase of 8.9%.
It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. The music to the ears of New Hope shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 56% to 59% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.
In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.
While we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for New Hope?
Insider interest in a company always sparks a bit of intrigue and many investors are on the lookout for companies where insiders are putting their money where their mouth is. That's because insider buying often indicates that those closest to the company have confidence that the share price will perform well. However, small purchases are not always indicative of conviction, and insiders don't always get it right.
It's pleasing to note that insiders spent AU$7.0m buying New Hope shares, over the last year, without reporting any share sales whatsoever. Buying like that is a fantastic look for the company and should rouse the market in anticipation for the future. It is also worth noting that it was Non-Executive Chairman Robert Millner who made the biggest single purchase, worth AU$1.7m, paying AU$5.62 per share.
On top of the insider buying, it's good to see that New Hope insiders have a valuable investment in the business. To be specific, they have AU$65m worth of shares. That's a lot of money, and no small incentive to work hard. Despite being just 1.5% of the company, the value of that investment is enough to show insiders have plenty riding on the venture.
While insiders already own a significant amount of shares, and they have been buying more, the good news for ordinary shareholders does not stop there. That's because New Hope's CEO, Rob Bishop, is paid at a relatively modest level when compared to other CEOs for companies of this size. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to New Hope, with market caps between AU$3.1b and AU$9.8b, is around AU$3.4m.
The New Hope CEO received AU$2.5m in compensation for the year ending July 2023. That seems pretty reasonable, especially given it's below the median for similar sized companies. While the level of CEO compensation shouldn't be the biggest factor in how the company is viewed, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.
One positive for New Hope is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. On top of that, we've seen insiders buying shares 
. These factors alone make the company an interesting prospect for your watchlist, as well as continuing research. It's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

A Look At The Intrinsic Value Of New Hope Corporation Limited (ASX:NHC) 2024-02-01T00:46:04.000Z

In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of New Hope Corporation Limited (
) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.
Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the 
.
We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:
 = AU$2.5b
After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.5%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$294m× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.5%– 2.1%) = AU$5.5b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$5.5b÷ ( 1 + 7.5%)
= AU$2.7b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is AU$5.1b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of AU$5.4, the company appears about fair value at a 11% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.
Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at New Hope as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.091. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For New Hope, there are three essential elements you should assess:

Public companies among New Hope Corporation Limited's (ASX:NHC) largest stockholders and were hit after last week's 10% price drop 2024-02-19T20:01:43.000Z

To get a sense of who is truly in control of New Hope Corporation Limited (
), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 39% stake, public companies possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.
And following last week's 10% decline in share price, public companies suffered the most losses.
Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about New Hope.
Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.
As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in New Hope. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of New Hope, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.
New Hope is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Washington H. Soul Pattinson and Company Limited with 39% of shares outstanding. JPMorgan Chase & Co, Brokerage and Securities Investments is the second largest shareholder owning 5.5% of common stock, and The Vanguard Group, Inc. holds about 2.9% of the company stock.
On looking further, we found that 50% of the shares are owned by the top 4 shareholders. In other words, these shareholders have a meaningful say in the decisions of the company.
Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
We can see that insiders own shares in New Hope Corporation Limited. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth AU$58m. Most would see this as a real positive. If you would like to explore the question of insider alignment, you can 
With a 39% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over New Hope. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.
We can see that public companies hold 39% of the New Hope shares on issue. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified

New Hope Corporation Limited's (ASX:NHC) Stock Has Been Sliding But Fundamentals Look Strong: Is The Market Wrong? 2024-03-04T22:05:03.000Z

New Hope (ASX:NHC) has had a rough month with its share price down 12%. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Specifically, we decided to study 
 ROE in this article.
Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.
The 
 is:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for New Hope is:
43% = AU$1.1b ÷ AU$2.5b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).
The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every A$1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated A$0.43 in profit.
We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or "retains", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
First thing first, we like that New Hope has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 15% which is quite remarkable. As a result, New Hope's exceptional 48% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise.
Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that New Hope's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 31% in the same period, which is great to see.
The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to 
, relative to its industry.
New Hope's three-year median payout ratio is a pretty moderate 40%, meaning the company retains 60% of its income. So it seems that New Hope is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees impressive growth in its earnings (discussed above) and pays a dividend that's well covered.
Additionally, New Hope has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 56% over the next three years. Consequently, the higher expected payout ratio explains the decline in the company's expected ROE (to 17%) over the same period.
In total, we are pretty happy with New Hope's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. That being so, according to the latest industry analyst forecasts, the company's earnings are expected to shrink in the future.

New Hope (ASX:NHC) Is Paying Out Less In Dividends Than Last Year 2024-03-21T20:04:24.000Z

 (
) is reducing its dividend from last year's comparable payment to A$0.17 on the 1st of May. Despite the cut, the dividend yield of 9.5% will still be comparable to other companies in the industry.
Unless the payments are sustainable, the dividend yield doesn't mean too much. New Hope was earning enough to cover the previous dividend, but it was paying out quite a large proportion of its free cash flows. By paying out so much of its cash flows, this could indicate that the company has limited opportunities for investment and growth.
EPS is set to fall by 34.5% over the next 12 months. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we believe the payout ratio could reach 109%, which could put the dividend under pressure if earnings don't start to improve.
Although the company has a long dividend history, it has been cut at least once in the last 10 years. The dividend has gone from an annual total of A$0.16 in 2014 to the most recent total annual payment of A$0.43. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 10% over that duration. Dividends have grown rapidly over this time, but with cuts in the past we are not certain that this stock will be a reliable source of income in the future.
With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share is growing. It's encouraging to see that New Hope has been growing its earnings per share at 29% a year over the past five years. The company's earnings per share has grown rapidly in recent years, and it has a good balance between reinvesting and paying dividends to shareholders, so we think that New Hope could prove to be a strong dividend payer.
Overall, the dividend looks like it may have been a bit high, which explains why it has now been cut. The company hasn't been paying a very consistent dividend over time, despite only paying out a small portion of earnings. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.
Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. Just as an example, we've come across 
 you should be aware of, and 1 of them can't be ignored. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas? Try our

Non-Executive Director of New Hope Picks Up 1.7% More Stock 2024-03-26T20:07:54.000Z

Investors who take an interest in 
 (
) should definitely note that the Non-Executive Director, Thomas Charles Millner, recently paid AU$4.69 per share to buy AU$469k worth of the stock. While that's a very decent purchase to our minds, it was proportionally a bit modest, boosting their holding by just 1.7%.
In the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Non-Executive Chairman Robert Millner bought AU$1.7m worth of shares at a price of AU$5.62 per share. That means that even when the share price was higher than AU$4.35 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock if insiders have bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price.
New Hope insiders may have bought shares in the last year, but they didn't sell any. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!
New Hope is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this 
 
Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It appears that New Hope insiders own 1.5% of the company, worth about AU$54m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.
It is good to see recent purchasing. And an analysis of the transactions over the last year also gives us confidence. Given that insiders also own a fair bit of New Hope we think they are probably pretty confident of a bright future. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 
 (of which 1 is significant!) you should know about.

New Hope Corp Ltd's Dividend Analysis 2024-04-15T11:04:42.000Z

New Hope Corp Ltd (
) recently announced a 
 of $0.17 per share, payable on 2024-05-01, with the ex-dividend date set for 2024-04-15. As investors look forward to this upcoming payment, the spotlight also shines on the company's dividend history, yield, and growth rates. Using the data from GuruFocus, let's look into New Hope Corp Ltd's dividend performance and assess its sustainability.
New Hope Corp Ltd is an Australian thermal coal miner with significant operations and assets. The company boasts two main mining operations: the wholly-owned New Acland coal mine in Queensland and the 80%-owned Bengalla coal mine in New South Wales. New Hope Corp Ltd is on track to substantially increase its annual production of salable thermal coal, aiming to reach around 13 million metric tons by fiscal 2028, a considerable jump from the 7.5 million metric tons expected in fiscal 2023. The company's coal production primarily serves the seaborne thermal coal export markets, with reserves at New Acland and Bengalla supporting operations for many decades. Additionally, New Hope Corp Ltd holds undeveloped coal resources in Queensland and a 20% stake in the Malabar-Maxwell metallurgical coal mine, which commenced production in 2023.
New Hope Corp Ltd has established a reliable track record of 
 since 2021, distributing dividends bi-annually. This consistent payout is a crucial factor for income-focused investors. Below is a chart showing the annual 
 for tracking historical trends.
As of today, New Hope Corp Ltd's 12-month 
 stands at 10.51%, with a 12-month 
 of 6.97%, indicating a projected decrease in dividend payments over the next year. Over the past three years, New Hope Corp Ltd's annual 
 was 59.60%, which slowed to 25.80% per year when extended to a five-year period. However, over the past decade, the company's annual dividends per share growth rate has been an impressive 11.90%.
Considering New Hope Corp Ltd's dividend yield and five-year growth rate, the 
 for the stock is approximately 33.11% as of today.
The sustainability of New Hope Corp Ltd's dividend is often gauged by its

Despite shrinking by AU$135m in the past week, New Hope (ASX:NHC) shareholders are still up 430% over 3 years 2024-04-17T20:01:42.000Z

It might seem bad, but the worst that can happen when you buy a stock (without leverage) is that its share price goes to zero. But if you buy shares in a really great company, you can 
 than double your money. To wit, the 
 (
) share price has flown 274% in the last three years. How nice for those who held the stock! The last week saw the share price soften some 3.3%.
While this past week has detracted from the company's three-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment.
To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.
New Hope became profitable within the last three years. Given the importance of this milestone, it's not overly surprising that the share price has increased strongly.
The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).
It's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of 
.
When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between 
 (TSR) and 
. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, New Hope's TSR for the last 3 years was 430%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the 
 shareholder return.
New Hope shareholders are down 3.7% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 8.4%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 22% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted 
 you should be aware of, and 1 of them makes us a bit uncomfortable.

Unveiling 3 Premier Dividend Stocks Yielding Over 5.1% 2024-04-24T05:02:51.000Z

As global markets show signs of vitality, with the US tech giants rallying and positive expectations for the ASX200, investors are keenly awaiting domestic economic cues from upcoming inflation data that could influence future interest rate decisions. Amidst these broader market movements, understanding the attributes of strong dividend stocks becomes crucial, especially in a landscape where economic indicators and corporate actions might sway investor sentiment.
Let's uncover some gems from our specialized screener.
 ★★★★☆☆
 New Hope Corporation Limited, operating in the energy sector, focuses on the exploration, development, production, and processing of coal and oil and gas properties with a market capitalization of approximately A$3.82 billion.
 New Hope Corporation Limited generates revenue primarily from its coal mining activities in New South Wales and Queensland, totaling approximately A$1.88 billion and A$0.05 billion respectively.
 9.5%
New Hope Corporation Limited, with a dividend yield of 9.51%, offers an attractive rate in the top 25% for Australian dividend stocks. Despite this, its dividends raise sustainability concerns; they are not well-covered by cash flows, evidenced by a high cash payout ratio of 90.2%. Financially, the company saw a significant drop in net income and revenue in the half-year report ending January 2024, with earnings per share also declining from A$0.775 to A$0.298. While trading at 45.2% below estimated fair value suggests potential upside, inconsistent dividends over the past decade and forecasted earnings decline could concern investors looking for stable returns.
 ★★★★☆☆
 NRW Holdings Limited is an Australian company offering diversified contract services to the resources and infrastructure sectors, with a market capitalization of approximately A$1.29 billion.
 NRW Holdings Limited generates its revenue primarily from three segments: Mining (A$1.49 billion), MET (A$739.07 million), and Civil (A$593.62 million).
 5.1%
NRW Holdings Limited, with a recent dividend of A$0.065, shows an unstable dividend history but has seen a 10-year increase in payouts. The company's dividends are reasonably covered by both earnings and cash flows, with payout ratios of 74% and 68.6% respectively. Despite a low yield of 5.11% compared to the market's top quartile at 6.24%, NRW trades at good value relative to peers and is forecasted to grow earnings by approximately 14.05% annually. Recent financials indicate a year-on-year growth in sales and net income as of December 2023.
 ★★★★☆☆
 Lycopodium Limited, with a market cap of A$464.56 million, offers engineering and project delivery services across the resources, infrastructure, and industrial processes sectors.
 Lycopodium Limited generates revenue primarily from its involvement in the process industries sector, totaling A$11.85 million.
 7.0%
Lycopodium Limited offers a dividend yield of 7.01%, ranking it in the top 25% for dividends within the Australian market. Despite this, its dividend sustainability is questionable, with a high cash payout ratio of 244.7% and earnings not sufficiently covering dividend payments. Recent financials show robust year-over-year earnings growth of 79.9%, with reaffirmed revenue guidance around A$345 million and NPAT between A$46 million to A$50 million for FY2024, signaling continued strong performance. However, significant insider selling over the past three months could raise concerns about its future prospects.

In this context, dividend stocks can offer investors potential stability and regular income streams, qualities that are particularly appealing in times of market fluctuation and sector-specific volatility.

Despite a decade of increasing dividends, the payments have been volatile, showing inconsistency. Currently, dividends are well-covered by earnings with a payout ratio of 69.8%, and forecasts suggest this will improve slightly to 63% in three years. However, concerns arise from Macquarie's low allowance for bad loans at 44% and a significant portion of liabilities funded through higher-risk external borrowing.

ASX Dividend Stocks: IGO And Two Others For Your Consideration 2024-06-19T19:05:50.000Z

Over the past year, the Australian market has seen a modest increase of 6.2%, despite recent stagnation with a flat performance over the last week. In this context, stocks like IGO that offer dividends can be particularly appealing to investors looking for steady income in addition to potential market growth.
We're going to check out a few of the best picks from our screener tool.
 ★★★★☆☆
 IGO Limited is an Australian exploration and mining company specializing in metals critical for clean energy, with a market capitalization of approximately A$4.53 billion.
 IGO Limited generates revenue primarily from its Nova Operation and Forrestania Operation, totaling approximately A$903.40 million.
 9.2%
IGO offers a high dividend yield at 9.18%, placing it in the top 25% of Australian dividend payers. However, its dividends have shown volatility over the past decade and are currently not well covered by earnings, with a payout ratio of 185%. Despite this, dividends are reasonably supported by cash flows due to a lower cash payout ratio of 39.7%. Earnings are projected to grow by 23.05% annually, but recent one-off items and declining profit margins raise concerns about the sustainability and reliability of future dividends.
 ★★★★☆☆
 Macquarie Group Limited, operating globally, offers a range of financial services across sectors with a market capitalization of approximately A$72.20 billion.
 Macquarie Group Limited generates revenue through various segments, including Macquarie Capital at A$2.61 billion, Macquarie Asset Management at A$3.75 billion, Banking and Financial Services at A$3.21 billion, and Commodities and Global Markets at A$6.32 billion.
 3.2%
Macquarie Group's dividend yield at 3.24% is modest compared to the market's top quartile, and its history of dividend payments has been inconsistent, with significant fluctuations over the past decade.

However, its dividend sustainability is questionable; while the payout ratio stands at a moderate 48.4%, indicating earnings coverage, both earnings forecasts predict a decline and high cash payout ratio (90.2%) suggests dividends aren't well-supported by cash flows, reflecting potential risk in continuity and growth of payouts.

Exploring ASX Dividend Stocks: Avoiding Lottery And Highlighting One Superior Option 2024-07-02T19:06:14.000Z

In the pursuit of reliable dividend income from ASX-listed companies, investors should be cautious about high payout ratios. While a generous dividend can be appealing, it's essential to verify if these payouts are supported by the company's earnings. A high payout ratio may indicate that dividends are not sustainable over time, potentially leading to financial difficulties for the company, as seen with some firms like Lottery.
Here's a peek at one of the choices from the screener and one that may be safer to dodge.
 ★★★★☆☆
 New Hope Corporation Limited, with a market cap of A$4.37 billion, is engaged in the exploration, development, production, and processing of coal and oil and gas properties.
 The company generates revenue primarily from its coal mining operations in New South Wales and Queensland, totaling A$1.93 billion.
 8.3%
New Hope's dividend yield of 8.32% ranks in the top quartile of Australian dividend payers, offering an attractive return compared to the market average of 6.59%. However, its dividends are not well supported by cash flows, with a high cash payout ratio of 90.2%, indicating potential sustainability issues despite a more moderate earnings payout ratio at 48.4%. Recent board changes could influence future financial strategies, but historically, dividend payments have been volatile and unreliable over the past decade.
 ★☆☆☆☆☆
 The Lottery Corporation Limited operates in the lottery and keno sectors within Australia, with a market capitalization of approximately A$11.11 billion.
 The company generates revenue primarily through its lotteries and keno segments, totaling approximately A$3.20 billion and A$279.70 million respectively.
 2.8%
Lottery's recent initiation of dividends, with a yield of 2.81%, falls below the top quartile benchmark of 6.59% in the Australian market, making it less attractive for those seeking high dividend returns. The company's dividend sustainability is questionable as both earnings and cash flows do not adequately cover its payouts, evidenced by payout ratios exceeding 100%. This financial strain is exacerbated by inadequate coverage from operating cash flow to debt, posing risks to future dividend reliability and growth.

New Hope Corporation Limited's (ASX:NHC) Intrinsic Value Is Potentially 56% Above Its Share Price 2024-07-31T20:01:28.000Z

In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of New Hope Corporation Limited (
) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!
Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the 
.
We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:
 = AU$3.3b
After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.3%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.3%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$305m× (1 + 2.3%) ÷ (7.3%– 2.3%) = AU$6.2b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$6.2b÷ ( 1 + 7.3%)
= AU$3.1b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is AU$6.4b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of AU$4.9, the company appears quite undervalued at a 36% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.
Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at New Hope as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.086. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to "what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For New Hope, there are three additional aspects you should assess:

Is New Hope Corporation Limited's (ASX:NHC) Stock's Recent Performance Being Led By Its Attractive Financial Prospects? 2023-09-26T20:55:25.000Z

New Hope's (ASX:NHC) stock is up by a considerable 28% over the past three months. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Particularly, we will be paying attention to 
 ROE today.
Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for New Hope is:
43% = AU$1.1b ÷ AU$2.5b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).
The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every A$1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn A$0.43 in profit.
So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or "retains", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.
First thing first, we like that New Hope has an impressive ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 24% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Under the circumstances, New Hope's considerable five year net income growth of 48% was to be expected.
We then compared New Hope's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 38% in the same 5-year period.
Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for NHC? You can find out in
New Hope's three-year median payout ratio is a pretty moderate 40%, meaning the company retains 60% of its income. So it seems that New Hope is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees impressive growth in its earnings (discussed above) and pays a dividend that's well covered.
Besides, New Hope has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 58% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected increase in the payout ratio explains the expected decline in the company's ROE to 19%, over the same period.
On the whole, we feel that New Hope's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future.

Investing in New Hope (ASX:NHC) three years ago would have delivered you a 598% gain 2023-10-12T03:32:16.000Z

For us, stock picking is in large part the hunt for the truly magnificent stocks. Not every pick can be a winner, but when you pick the right stock, you 
 win big. For example, the 
 (
) share price is up a whopping 420% in the last three years, a handsome return for long term holders. It's also good to see the share price up 34% over the last quarter. This could be related to the recent financial results, released recently - you can catch up on the most recent data by reading 
.
So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.
To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.
During three years of share price growth, New Hope moved from a loss to profitability. That kind of transition can be an inflection point that justifies a strong share price gain, just as we have seen here.
The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).
It's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of New Hope's 
.
It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for New Hope the TSR over the last 3 years was 598%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the 
 shareholder return.
New Hope provided a TSR of 11% over the year (including dividends). That's fairly close to the broader market return. It has to be noted that the recent return falls short of the 22% shareholders have gained each year, over half a decade. More recently, the share price growth has slowed. But it has to be said the overall picture is one of good long term and short term performance. Arguably that makes New Hope a stock worth watching. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified

Insider Stock Buying Reaches AU$7.04m On New Hope 2023-11-22T21:10:36.000Z

Quite a few insiders have dramatically grown their holdings in 
 (
) over the past 12 months. An insider's optimism about the company's prospects is a positive sign.
While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.
In the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Non-Executive Chairman Robert Millner bought AU$1.7m worth of shares at a price of AU$5.62 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, even at a higher price than the current share price (being AU$5.30). It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock if insiders have bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price.
New Hope insiders may have bought shares in the last year, but they didn't sell any. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!
There are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. So if that suits your style you could check each stock one by one or you could take a look at this 
 
It's good to see that New Hope insiders have made notable investments in the company's shares. In total, insiders bought AU$1.3m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any sales whatsoever. This could be interpreted as suggesting a positive outlook.
I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It appears that New Hope insiders own 1.5% of the company, worth about AU$66m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.
The recent insider purchases are heartening. We also take confidence from the longer term picture of insider transactions. Insiders likely see value in New Hope shares, given these transactions (along with notable insider ownership of the company). While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. To help with this, we've discovered 
 (1 shouldn't be ignored!) that you ought to be aware of before buying any shares in New Hope.

Here's Why New Hope (ASX:NHC) Has Caught The Eye Of Investors 2024-01-17T23:23:32.000Z

Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. But as Peter Lynch said in 
, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.
In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like 
 (ASX:NHC), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.
New Hope has undergone a massive growth in earnings per share over the last three years. So much so that this three year growth rate wouldn't be a fair assessment of the company's future. As a result, we'll zoom in on growth over the last year, instead. Over the last year, New Hope increased its EPS from AU$1.18 to AU$1.29. That's a fair increase of 8.9%.
It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. The music to the ears of New Hope shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 56% to 59% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.
In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.
While we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for New Hope?
Insider interest in a company always sparks a bit of intrigue and many investors are on the lookout for companies where insiders are putting their money where their mouth is. That's because insider buying often indicates that those closest to the company have confidence that the share price will perform well. However, small purchases are not always indicative of conviction, and insiders don't always get it right.
It's pleasing to note that insiders spent AU$7.0m buying New Hope shares, over the last year, without reporting any share sales whatsoever. Buying like that is a fantastic look for the company and should rouse the market in anticipation for the future. It is also worth noting that it was Non-Executive Chairman Robert Millner who made the biggest single purchase, worth AU$1.7m, paying AU$5.62 per share.
On top of the insider buying, it's good to see that New Hope insiders have a valuable investment in the business. To be specific, they have AU$65m worth of shares. That's a lot of money, and no small incentive to work hard. Despite being just 1.5% of the company, the value of that investment is enough to show insiders have plenty riding on the venture.
While insiders already own a significant amount of shares, and they have been buying more, the good news for ordinary shareholders does not stop there. That's because New Hope's CEO, Rob Bishop, is paid at a relatively modest level when compared to other CEOs for companies of this size. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to New Hope, with market caps between AU$3.1b and AU$9.8b, is around AU$3.4m.
The New Hope CEO received AU$2.5m in compensation for the year ending July 2023. That seems pretty reasonable, especially given it's below the median for similar sized companies. While the level of CEO compensation shouldn't be the biggest factor in how the company is viewed, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.
One positive for New Hope is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. On top of that, we've seen insiders buying shares 
. These factors alone make the company an interesting prospect for your watchlist, as well as continuing research. It's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

A Look At The Intrinsic Value Of New Hope Corporation Limited (ASX:NHC) 2024-02-01T00:46:04.000Z

In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of New Hope Corporation Limited (
) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.
Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the 
.
We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:
 = AU$2.5b
After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.5%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$294m× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.5%– 2.1%) = AU$5.5b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$5.5b÷ ( 1 + 7.5%)
= AU$2.7b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is AU$5.1b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of AU$5.4, the company appears about fair value at a 11% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.
Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at New Hope as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.091. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For New Hope, there are three essential elements you should assess:

Public companies among New Hope Corporation Limited's (ASX:NHC) largest stockholders and were hit after last week's 10% price drop 2024-02-19T20:01:43.000Z

To get a sense of who is truly in control of New Hope Corporation Limited (
), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 39% stake, public companies possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.
And following last week's 10% decline in share price, public companies suffered the most losses.
Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about New Hope.
Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.
As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in New Hope. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of New Hope, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.
New Hope is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Washington H. Soul Pattinson and Company Limited with 39% of shares outstanding. JPMorgan Chase & Co, Brokerage and Securities Investments is the second largest shareholder owning 5.5% of common stock, and The Vanguard Group, Inc. holds about 2.9% of the company stock.
On looking further, we found that 50% of the shares are owned by the top 4 shareholders. In other words, these shareholders have a meaningful say in the decisions of the company.
Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
We can see that insiders own shares in New Hope Corporation Limited. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth AU$58m. Most would see this as a real positive. If you would like to explore the question of insider alignment, you can 
With a 39% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over New Hope. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.
We can see that public companies hold 39% of the New Hope shares on issue. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified

New Hope (ASX:NHC) Is Paying Out Less In Dividends Than Last Year 2024-03-21T20:04:24.000Z

 (
) is reducing its dividend from last year's comparable payment to A$0.17 on the 1st of May. Despite the cut, the dividend yield of 9.5% will still be comparable to other companies in the industry.
Unless the payments are sustainable, the dividend yield doesn't mean too much. New Hope was earning enough to cover the previous dividend, but it was paying out quite a large proportion of its free cash flows. By paying out so much of its cash flows, this could indicate that the company has limited opportunities for investment and growth.
EPS is set to fall by 34.5% over the next 12 months. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we believe the payout ratio could reach 109%, which could put the dividend under pressure if earnings don't start to improve.
Although the company has a long dividend history, it has been cut at least once in the last 10 years. The dividend has gone from an annual total of A$0.16 in 2014 to the most recent total annual payment of A$0.43. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 10% over that duration. Dividends have grown rapidly over this time, but with cuts in the past we are not certain that this stock will be a reliable source of income in the future.
With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share is growing. It's encouraging to see that New Hope has been growing its earnings per share at 29% a year over the past five years. The company's earnings per share has grown rapidly in recent years, and it has a good balance between reinvesting and paying dividends to shareholders, so we think that New Hope could prove to be a strong dividend payer.
Overall, the dividend looks like it may have been a bit high, which explains why it has now been cut. The company hasn't been paying a very consistent dividend over time, despite only paying out a small portion of earnings. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.
Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. Just as an example, we've come across 
 you should be aware of, and 1 of them can't be ignored. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas? Try our

New Hope Corporation Limited's (ASX:NHC) Stock Has Been Sliding But Fundamentals Look Strong: Is The Market Wrong? 2024-03-04T22:05:03.000Z

New Hope (ASX:NHC) has had a rough month with its share price down 12%. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Specifically, we decided to study 
 ROE in this article.
Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.
The 
 is:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for New Hope is:
43% = AU$1.1b ÷ AU$2.5b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).
The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every A$1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated A$0.43 in profit.
We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or "retains", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
First thing first, we like that New Hope has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 15% which is quite remarkable. As a result, New Hope's exceptional 48% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise.
Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that New Hope's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 31% in the same period, which is great to see.
The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to 
, relative to its industry.
New Hope's three-year median payout ratio is a pretty moderate 40%, meaning the company retains 60% of its income. So it seems that New Hope is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees impressive growth in its earnings (discussed above) and pays a dividend that's well covered.
Additionally, New Hope has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 56% over the next three years. Consequently, the higher expected payout ratio explains the decline in the company's expected ROE (to 17%) over the same period.
In total, we are pretty happy with New Hope's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. That being so, according to the latest industry analyst forecasts, the company's earnings are expected to shrink in the future.

Non-Executive Director of New Hope Picks Up 1.7% More Stock 2024-03-26T20:07:54.000Z

Investors who take an interest in 
 (
) should definitely note that the Non-Executive Director, Thomas Charles Millner, recently paid AU$4.69 per share to buy AU$469k worth of the stock. While that's a very decent purchase to our minds, it was proportionally a bit modest, boosting their holding by just 1.7%.
In the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Non-Executive Chairman Robert Millner bought AU$1.7m worth of shares at a price of AU$5.62 per share. That means that even when the share price was higher than AU$4.35 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock if insiders have bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price.
New Hope insiders may have bought shares in the last year, but they didn't sell any. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!
New Hope is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this 
 
Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It appears that New Hope insiders own 1.5% of the company, worth about AU$54m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.
It is good to see recent purchasing. And an analysis of the transactions over the last year also gives us confidence. Given that insiders also own a fair bit of New Hope we think they are probably pretty confident of a bright future. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Every company has risks, and we've spotted

) recently announced a 
 of $0.17 per share, payable on 2024-05-01, with the ex-dividend date set for 2024-04-15. As investors look forward to this upcoming payment, the spotlight also shines on the company's dividend history, yield, and growth rates. Using the data from GuruFocus, let's look into New Hope Corp Ltd's dividend performance and assess its sustainability.
New Hope Corp Ltd is an Australian thermal coal miner with significant operations and assets. The company boasts two main mining operations: the wholly-owned New Acland coal mine in Queensland and the 80%-owned Bengalla coal mine in New South Wales. New Hope Corp Ltd is on track to substantially increase its annual production of salable thermal coal, aiming to reach around 13 million metric tons by fiscal 2028, a considerable jump from the 7.5 million metric tons expected in fiscal 2023. The company's coal production primarily serves the seaborne thermal coal export markets, with reserves at New Acland and Bengalla supporting operations for many decades. Additionally, New Hope Corp Ltd holds undeveloped coal resources in Queensland and a 20% stake in the Malabar-Maxwell metallurgical coal mine, which commenced production in 2023.
New Hope Corp Ltd has established a reliable track record of 
 since 2021, distributing dividends bi-annually. This consistent payout is a crucial factor for income-focused investors. Below is a chart showing the annual

As of today, New Hope Corp Ltd's 12-month 
 stands at 10.51%, with a 12-month

 was 59.60%, which slowed to 25.80% per year when extended to a five-year period. However, over the past decade, the company's annual dividends per share growth rate has been an impressive 11.90%.
Considering New Hope Corp Ltd's dividend yield and five-year growth rate, the

The sustainability of New Hope Corp Ltd's dividend is often gauged by its 
, which currently stands at 0.66 as of 2024-01-31. This figure represents the portion of earnings paid out as dividends and suggests the company is managing its financial resources prudently. Additionally, the 
 of 6 out of 10 indicates fair profitability, with New Hope Corp Ltd recording net profit in 7 of the past 10 years.
For dividends to be sustainable in the long term, New Hope Corp Ltd needs to demonstrate strong growth metrics. The company's

Despite shrinking by AU$135m in the past week, New Hope (ASX:NHC) shareholders are still up 430% over 3 years 2024-04-17T20:01:42.000Z

It might seem bad, but the worst that can happen when you buy a stock (without leverage) is that its share price goes to zero. But if you buy shares in a really great company, you can 
 than double your money. To wit, the 
 (
) share price has flown 274% in the last three years. How nice for those who held the stock! The last week saw the share price soften some 3.3%.
While this past week has detracted from the company's three-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment.
To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.
New Hope became profitable within the last three years. Given the importance of this milestone, it's not overly surprising that the share price has increased strongly.
The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).
It's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of 
.
When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between 
 (TSR) and 
. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, New Hope's TSR for the last 3 years was 430%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the 
 shareholder return.
New Hope shareholders are down 3.7% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 8.4%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 22% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted 
 you should be aware of, and 1 of them makes us a bit uncomfortable.

 New Hope Corporation Limited, operating in the energy sector, focuses on the exploration, development, production, and processing of coal and oil and gas properties with a market capitalization of approximately A$3.82 billion.

 9.5%
New Hope Corporation Limited, with a dividend yield of 9.51%, offers an attractive rate in the top 25% for Australian dividend stocks.

Financially, the company saw a significant drop in net income and revenue in the half-year report ending January 2024, with earnings per share also declining from A$0.775 to A$0.298. While trading at 45.2% below estimated fair value suggests potential upside, inconsistent dividends over the past decade and forecasted earnings decline could concern investors looking for stable returns.
 ★★★★☆☆
 NRW Holdings Limited is an Australian company offering diversified contract services to the resources and infrastructure sectors, with a market capitalization of approximately A$1.29 billion.
 NRW Holdings Limited generates its revenue primarily from three segments: Mining (A$1.49 billion), MET (A$739.07 million), and Civil (A$593.62 million).

Recent financials show robust year-over-year earnings growth of 79.9%, with reaffirmed revenue guidance around A$345 million and NPAT between A$46 million to A$50 million for FY2024, signaling continued strong performance. However, significant insider selling over the past three months could raise concerns about its future prospects.

Currently, dividends are well-covered by earnings with a payout ratio of 69.8%, and forecasts suggest this will improve slightly to 63% in three years. However, concerns arise from Macquarie's low allowance for bad loans at 44% and a significant portion of liabilities funded through higher-risk external borrowing.

ASX Dividend Stocks: IGO And Two Others For Your Consideration 2024-06-19T19:05:50.000Z

Over the past year, the Australian market has seen a modest increase of 6.2%, despite recent stagnation with a flat performance over the last week. In this context, stocks like IGO that offer dividends can be particularly appealing to investors looking for steady income in addition to potential market growth.
We're going to check out a few of the best picks from our screener tool.

 IGO Limited generates revenue primarily from its Nova Operation and Forrestania Operation, totaling approximately A$903.40 million.
 9.2%
IGO offers a high dividend yield at 9.18%, placing it in the top 25% of Australian dividend payers. However, its dividends have shown volatility over the past decade and are currently not well covered by earnings, with a payout ratio of 185%. Despite this, dividends are reasonably supported by cash flows due to a lower cash payout ratio of 39.7%. Earnings are projected to grow by 23.05% annually, but recent one-off items and declining profit margins raise concerns about the sustainability and reliability of future dividends.
 ★★★★☆☆
 Macquarie Group Limited, operating globally, offers a range of financial services across sectors with a market capitalization of approximately A$72.20 billion.

Macquarie Group's dividend yield at 3.24% is modest compared to the market's top quartile, and its history of dividend payments has been inconsistent, with significant fluctuations over the past decade. Although its payout ratio of 69.8% suggests that dividends are currently supported by earnings, this coverage is expected to slightly improve in the next three years to a forecasted payout ratio of 63%. The company also maintains a low allowance for bad loans at 44%, indicating potential vulnerability in its loan portfolio.
 ★★★★☆☆

However, its dividend sustainability is questionable; while the payout ratio stands at a moderate 48.4%, indicating earnings coverage, both earnings forecasts predict a decline and high cash payout ratio (90.2%) suggests dividends aren't well-supported by cash flows, reflecting potential risk in continuity and growth of payouts.

Exploring ASX Dividend Stocks: Avoiding Lottery And Highlighting One Superior Option 2024-07-02T19:06:14.000Z

In the pursuit of reliable dividend income from ASX-listed companies, investors should be cautious about high payout ratios. While a generous dividend can be appealing, it's essential to verify if these payouts are supported by the company's earnings. A high payout ratio may indicate that dividends are not sustainable over time, potentially leading to financial difficulties for the company, as seen with some firms like Lottery.
Here's a peek at one of the choices from the screener and one that may be safer to dodge.
 ★★★★☆☆
 New Hope Corporation Limited, with a market cap of A$4.37 billion, is engaged in the exploration, development, production, and processing of coal and oil and gas properties.
 The company generates revenue primarily from its coal mining operations in New South Wales and Queensland, totaling A$1.93 billion.
 8.3%
New Hope's dividend yield of 8.32% ranks in the top quartile of Australian dividend payers, offering an attractive return compared to the market average of 6.59%. However, its dividends are not well supported by cash flows, with a high cash payout ratio of 90.2%, indicating potential sustainability issues despite a more moderate earnings payout ratio at 48.4%. Recent board changes could influence future financial strategies, but historically, dividend payments have been volatile and unreliable over the past decade.
 ★☆☆☆☆☆
 The Lottery Corporation Limited operates in the lottery and keno sectors within Australia, with a market capitalization of approximately A$11.11 billion.
 The company generates revenue primarily through its lotteries and keno segments, totaling approximately A$3.20 billion and A$279.70 million respectively.
 2.8%
Lottery's recent initiation of dividends, with a yield of 2.81%, falls below the top quartile benchmark of 6.59% in the Australian market, making it less attractive for those seeking high dividend returns. The company's dividend sustainability is questionable as both earnings and cash flows do not adequately cover its payouts, evidenced by payout ratios exceeding 100%. This financial strain is exacerbated by inadequate coverage from operating cash flow to debt, posing risks to future dividend reliability and growth.

Currently, dividends yield at 6.38%, slightly below the top tier in Australia's market. However, both earnings and cash flows substantiate its dividends with payout ratios at 43.7% and 38.9%, respectively, indicating reasonable coverage and sustainability moving forward.

 New Hope Corporation Limited, with a market cap of A$4.37 billion, is engaged in the exploration, development, production, and processing of coal, as well as oil and gas properties.

 8.3%
New Hope's dividend yield stands at a robust 8.32%, ranking in the top quartile of Australian dividend stocks, yet its sustainability is questionable with dividends poorly covered by cash flows (90.2% cash payout ratio).

Recent board changes include the resignation of Director Todd James Barlow and appointment of Brent Charles Albert Smith, potentially impacting governance and strategic direction.
 ★★★★☆☆

Forecasted average earnings decline of 0.4% annually over the next three years could pressure future payouts.

The company has maintained stable and reliable dividends over the past decade, with an anticipated earnings growth rate of 18.28% per year, suggesting potential for future dividend sustainability and growth.

New Hope Corporation Limited's (ASX:NHC) Intrinsic Value Is Potentially 56% Above Its Share Price 2024-07-31T20:01:28.000Z

In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of New Hope Corporation Limited (
) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!
Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the 
.
We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:
 = AU$3.3b
After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.3%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.3%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$305m× (1 + 2.3%) ÷ (7.3%– 2.3%) = AU$6.2b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$6.2b÷ ( 1 + 7.3%)
= AU$3.1b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is AU$6.4b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of AU$4.9, the company appears quite undervalued at a 36% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.
Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at New Hope as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.086. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to "what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For New Hope, there are three additional aspects you should assess:
