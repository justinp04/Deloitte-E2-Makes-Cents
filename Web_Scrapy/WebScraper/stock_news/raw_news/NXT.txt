Capital Allocation Trends At NEXTDC (ASX:NXT) Aren't Ideal

Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics. Firstly, we'll want to see a proven 
 on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding 
 of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Having said that, from a first glance at 
 (
) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.
If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on NEXTDC is:
0.013 = AU$50m รท (AU$3.8b - AU$92m) 
.
So, 
 In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the IT industry average of 15%.
In the above chart we have measured NEXTDC's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our 
 
.
When we looked at the ROCE trend at NEXTDC, we didn't gain much confidence. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 2.3% over the last five years. Although, given both revenue and the amount of assets employed in the business have increased, it could suggest the company is investing in growth, and the extra capital has led to a short-term reduction in ROCE. If these investments prove successful, this can bode very well for long term stock performance.
Even though returns on capital have fallen in the short term, we find it promising that revenue and capital employed have both increased for NEXTDC. And the stock has done incredibly well with a 112% return over the last five years, so long term investors are no doubt ecstatic with that result. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we would look further into this stock to make sure the other metrics justify the positive view.
NEXTDC does have some risks, we noticed

Increases to CEO Compensation Might Be Put On Hold For Now at NEXTDC Limited (ASX:NXT)

Under the guidance of CEO Craig Scroggie, 
 (
) has performed reasonably well recently. As shareholders go into the upcoming AGM on 24th of November, CEO compensation will probably not be their focus, but rather the steps management will take to continue the growth momentum. However, some shareholders will still be cautious of paying the CEO excessively.
At the time of writing, our data shows that NEXTDC Limited has a market capitalization of AU$6.7b, and reported total annual CEO compensation of AU$3.2m for the year to June 2023. That's a notable decrease of 10% on last year. We think total compensation is more important but our data shows that the CEO salary is lower, at AU$1.3m.
For comparison, other companies in the 
 with market capitalizations ranging between AU$3.1b and AU$9.8b had a median total CEO compensation of AU$2.0m. Hence, we can conclude that Craig Scroggie is remunerated higher than the industry median. Furthermore, Craig Scroggie directly owns AU$5.8m worth of shares in the company, implying that they are deeply invested in the company's success.
On an industry level, total compensation is equally proportioned between salary and other compensation, that is, they each represent approximately 50% of the total compensation. In NEXTDC's case, non-salary compensation represents a greater slice of total remuneration, in comparison to the broader industry. If total compensation is slanted towards non-salary benefits, it indicates that CEO pay is linked to company performance.
NEXTDC Limited has seen its earnings per share (EPS) increase by 78% a year over the past three years. Its revenue is up 25% over the last year.
Overall this is a positive result for shareholders, showing that the company has improved in recent years. It's also good to see decent revenue growth in the last year, suggesting the business is healthy and growing. Moving away from current form for a second, it could be important to check 
.
NEXTDC Limited has not done too badly by shareholders, with a total return of 7.8%, over three years. It would be nice to see that metric improve in the future. As a result, investors in the company might be reluctant about agreeing to increase CEO pay in the future, before seeing an improvement on their returns.
Seeing that the company has put up a decent performance, only a few shareholders, if any at all, might have questions about the CEO pay in the upcoming AGM. Still, not all shareholders might be in favor of a pay raise to the CEO, seeing that they are already being paid higher than the industry.
It is always advisable to analyse CEO pay, along with performing a thorough analysis of the company's key performance areas. In our study, we found 
 you should be aware of, and 1 of them can't be ignored.

NEXTDC (ASX:NXT) delivers shareholders stellar 17% CAGR over 5 years, surging 3.1% in the last week alone

The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. Long term 
 (ASX:NXT) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 120% in five years. On top of that, the share price is up 14% in about a quarter. But this move may well have been assisted by the reasonably buoyant market (up 9.8% in 90 days).
On the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns.
NEXTDC wasn't profitable in the last twelve months, it is unlikely we'll see a strong correlation between its share price and its earnings per share (EPS). Arguably revenue is our next best option. When a company doesn't make profits, we'd generally expect to see good revenue growth. Some companies are willing to postpone profitability to grow revenue faster, but in that case one does expect good top-line growth.
In the last 5 years NEXTDC saw its revenue grow at 17% per year. Even measured against other revenue-focussed companies, that's a good result. Meanwhile, its share price performance certainly reflects the strong growth, given the share price grew at 17% per year, compound, during the period. So it seems likely that buyers have paid attention to the strong revenue growth. To our minds that makes NEXTDC worth investigating - it may have its best days ahead.
The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).
We consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. This 
 report showing analyst forecasts should help you form a view on NEXTDC
It's nice to see that NEXTDC shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 53% over the last year. That's better than the annualised return of 17% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 
 (of which 1 is a bit unpleasant!) you should know about.

Insider Stock Buying Reaches AU$1.19m On NEXTDC

Generally, when a single insider buys stock, it is usually not a big deal. However, when several insiders are buying, like in the case of 
 (
), it sends a favourable message to the company's shareholders.
While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.
The CEO, MD & Executive Director Craig Scroggie made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for AU$578k worth of shares at a price of AU$10.80 each. We do like to see buying, but this purchase was made at well below the current price of AU$14.47. Because the shares were purchased at a lower price, this particular buy doesn't tell us much about how insiders feel about the current share price.
While NEXTDC insiders bought shares during the last year, they didn't sell. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!
There are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. So if that suits your style you could check each stock one by one or you could take a look at this 
 
For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. NEXTDC insiders own about AU$47m worth of shares. That equates to 0.6% of the company. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.
It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded NEXTDC shares in the last quarter. However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening. Overall we don't see anything to make us think NEXTDC insiders are doubting the company, and they do own shares. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. When we did our research, we found 
 (1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that we believe deserve your full attention.

Individual investors account for 56% of NEXTDC Limited's (ASX:NXT) ownership, while institutions account for 43%

Every investor in NEXTDC Limited (ASX:NXT) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that individual investors own the lion's share in the company with 56% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
Meanwhile, institutions make up 43% of the companyโs shareholders. Large companies usually have institutions as shareholders, and we usually see insiders owning shares in smaller companies.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of NEXTDC.
Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.
NEXTDC already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see NEXTDC's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
NEXTDC is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that BlackRock, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 5.8% of shares outstanding. Australian Super Pty Ltd is the second largest shareholder owning 5.1% of common stock, and The Vanguard Group, Inc. holds about 5.0% of the company stock.
Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.
The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.
I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.
Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of NEXTDC Limited in their own names. It is a pretty big company, so it would be possible for board members to own a meaningful interest in the company, without owning much of a proportional interest. In this case, they own around AU$44m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying.
The general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, collectively holds 56% of NEXTDC shares. This size of ownership gives investors from the general public some collective power. They can and probably do influence decisions on executive compensation, dividend policies and proposed business acquisitions.
I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should learn about the 
 we've spotted with NEXTDC (including 1 which shouldn't be ignored) .

NEXTDC (ASX:NXT) Hasn't Managed To Accelerate Its Returns

To find a multi-bagger stock, what are the underlying trends we should look for in a business? Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing 
 on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding 
 of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. Having said that, from a first glance at 
 (
) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.
For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for NEXTDC, this is the formula:
0.014 = AU$53m รท (AU$3.8b - AU$87m) 
.
Therefore, 
 In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the IT industry average of 7.9%.
Above you can see how the current ROCE for NEXTDC compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our 
.
There are better returns on capital out there than what we're seeing at NEXTDC. The company has employed 139% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 1.4%. Given the company has increased the amount of capital employed, it appears the investments that have been made simply don't provide a high return on capital.
In conclusion, NEXTDC has been investing more capital into the business, but returns on that capital haven't increased. Investors must think there's better things to come because the stock has knocked it out of the park, delivering a 203% gain to shareholders who have held over the last five years. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.
One final note, you should learn about the

NEXTDC's (ASX:NXT) investors will be pleased with their solid 170% return over the last five years

When you buy a stock there is always a possibility that it could drop 100%. But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. For example, the 
 (
) share price has soared 164% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that.
Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.
Given that NEXTDC didn't make a profit in the last twelve months, we'll focus on revenue growth to form a quick view of its business development. Shareholders of unprofitable companies usually desire strong revenue growth. That's because it's hard to be confident a company will be sustainable if revenue growth is negligible, and it never makes a profit.
In the last 5 years NEXTDC saw its revenue grow at 19% per year. Even measured against other revenue-focussed companies, that's a good result. So it's not entirely surprising that the share price reflected this performance by increasing at a rate of 21% per year, in that time. This suggests the market has well and truly recognized the progress the business has made. NEXTDC seems like a high growth stock - so growth investors might want to add it to their watchlist.
The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).
It's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. You can see what analysts are predicting for NEXTDC in this 
 
.
Investors should note that there's a difference between NEXTDC's total shareholder return (TSR) and its share price change, which we've covered above. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. NEXTDC hasn't been paying dividends, but its TSR of 170% exceeds its share price return of 164%, implying it has either spun-off a business, or raised capital at a discount; thereby providing additional value to shareholders.
It's nice to see that NEXTDC shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 48% over the last year. That's better than the annualised return of 22% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand NEXTDC better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 
 that you should be aware of before investing here.

Painful week for individual investors invested in NEXTDC Limited (ASX:NXT) after 4.6% drop, institutions also suffered losses

If you want to know who really controls NEXTDC Limited (
), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that individual investors own the lion's share in the company with 57% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.
Following a 4.6% decrease in the stock price last week, individual investors suffered the most losses, but institutions who own 43% stock also took a hit.
Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of NEXTDC, beginning with the chart below.
Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.
As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in NEXTDC. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at NEXTDC's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.
We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in NEXTDC. Our data shows that Australian Super Pty Ltd is the largest shareholder with 6.0% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 5.3% and 4.3% of the stock.
Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.
Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.
Our information suggests that NEXTDC Limited insiders own under 1% of the company. It's a big company, so even a small proportional interest can create alignment between the board and shareholders. In this case insiders own AU$56m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking 
The general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, collectively holds 57% of NEXTDC shares. This size of ownership gives investors from the general public some collective power. They can and probably do influence decisions on executive compensation, dividend policies and proposed business acquisitions.

Increases to CEO Compensation Might Be Put On Hold For Now at NEXTDC Limited (ASX:NXT)

Under the guidance of CEO Craig Scroggie, 
 (
) has performed reasonably well recently. As shareholders go into the upcoming AGM on 24th of November, CEO compensation will probably not be their focus, but rather the steps management will take to continue the growth momentum. However, some shareholders will still be cautious of paying the CEO excessively.
At the time of writing, our data shows that NEXTDC Limited has a market capitalization of AU$6.7b, and reported total annual CEO compensation of AU$3.2m for the year to June 2023. That's a notable decrease of 10% on last year. We think total compensation is more important but our data shows that the CEO salary is lower, at AU$1.3m.
For comparison, other companies in the 
 with market capitalizations ranging between AU$3.1b and AU$9.8b had a median total CEO compensation of AU$2.0m. Hence, we can conclude that Craig Scroggie is remunerated higher than the industry median. Furthermore, Craig Scroggie directly owns AU$5.8m worth of shares in the company, implying that they are deeply invested in the company's success.
On an industry level, total compensation is equally proportioned between salary and other compensation, that is, they each represent approximately 50% of the total compensation. In NEXTDC's case, non-salary compensation represents a greater slice of total remuneration, in comparison to the broader industry. If total compensation is slanted towards non-salary benefits, it indicates that CEO pay is linked to company performance.
NEXTDC Limited has seen its earnings per share (EPS) increase by 78% a year over the past three years. Its revenue is up 25% over the last year.
Overall this is a positive result for shareholders, showing that the company has improved in recent years. It's also good to see decent revenue growth in the last year, suggesting the business is healthy and growing. Moving away from current form for a second, it could be important to check 
.
NEXTDC Limited has not done too badly by shareholders, with a total return of 7.8%, over three years. It would be nice to see that metric improve in the future. As a result, investors in the company might be reluctant about agreeing to increase CEO pay in the future, before seeing an improvement on their returns.
Seeing that the company has put up a decent performance, only a few shareholders, if any at all, might have questions about the CEO pay in the upcoming AGM. Still, not all shareholders might be in favor of a pay raise to the CEO, seeing that they are already being paid higher than the industry.
It is always advisable to analyse CEO pay, along with performing a thorough analysis of the company's key performance areas. In our study, we found 
 you should be aware of, and 1 of them can't be ignored.

Individual investors account for 56% of NEXTDC Limited's (ASX:NXT) ownership, while institutions account for 43%

In this case, they own around AU$44m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying.
The general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, collectively holds 56% of NEXTDC shares. This size of ownership gives investors from the general public some collective power. They can and probably do influence decisions on executive compensation, dividend policies and proposed business acquisitions.
I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should learn about the 
 we've spotted with NEXTDC (including 1 which shouldn't be ignored) .

Insider Stock Buying Reaches AU$1.19m On NEXTDC

Generally, when a single insider buys stock, it is usually not a big deal. However, when several insiders are buying, like in the case of 
 (
), it sends a favourable message to the company's shareholders.
While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.
The CEO, MD & Executive Director Craig Scroggie made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for AU$578k worth of shares at a price of AU$10.80 each. We do like to see buying, but this purchase was made at well below the current price of AU$14.47. Because the shares were purchased at a lower price, this particular buy doesn't tell us much about how insiders feel about the current share price.
While NEXTDC insiders bought shares during the last year, they didn't sell. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!
There are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. So if that suits your style you could check each stock one by one or you could take a look at this 
 
For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. NEXTDC insiders own about AU$47m worth of shares. That equates to 0.6% of the company. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.
It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded NEXTDC shares in the last quarter. However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening. Overall we don't see anything to make us think NEXTDC insiders are doubting the company, and they do own shares. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. When we did our research, we found 
 (1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that we believe deserve your full attention.

NEXTDC (ASX:NXT) Hasn't Managed To Accelerate Its Returns

To find a multi-bagger stock, what are the underlying trends we should look for in a business? Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing 
 on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding 
 of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. Having said that, from a first glance at 
 (
) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.
For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for NEXTDC, this is the formula:
0.014 = AU$53m รท (AU$3.8b - AU$87m) 
.
Therefore, 
 In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the IT industry average of 7.9%.
Above you can see how the current ROCE for NEXTDC compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our 
.
There are better returns on capital out there than what we're seeing at NEXTDC. The company has employed 139% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 1.4%. Given the company has increased the amount of capital employed, it appears the investments that have been made simply don't provide a high return on capital.
In conclusion, NEXTDC has been investing more capital into the business, but returns on that capital haven't increased. Investors must think there's better things to come because the stock has knocked it out of the park, delivering a 203% gain to shareholders who have held over the last five years. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.

Painful week for individual investors invested in NEXTDC Limited (ASX:NXT) after 4.6% drop, institutions also suffered losses

If you want to know who really controls NEXTDC Limited (
), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that individual investors own the lion's share in the company with 57% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.
Following a 4.6% decrease in the stock price last week, individual investors suffered the most losses, but institutions who own 43% stock also took a hit.
Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of NEXTDC, beginning with the chart below.
Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.
As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in NEXTDC. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at NEXTDC's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.
We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in NEXTDC. Our data shows that Australian Super Pty Ltd is the largest shareholder with 6.0% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 5.3% and 4.3% of the stock.
Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.
Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.
Our information suggests that NEXTDC Limited insiders own under 1% of the company. It's a big company, so even a small proportional interest can create alignment between the board and shareholders. In this case insiders own AU$56m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking 
The general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, collectively holds 57% of NEXTDC shares. This size of ownership gives investors from the general public some collective power. They can and probably do influence decisions on executive compensation, dividend policies and proposed business acquisitions.

NEXTDC's (ASX:NXT) investors will be pleased with their solid 170% return over the last five years

When you buy a stock there is always a possibility that it could drop 100%. But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. For example, the 
 (
) share price has soared 164% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that.
Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.
Given that NEXTDC didn't make a profit in the last twelve months, we'll focus on revenue growth to form a quick view of its business development. Shareholders of unprofitable companies usually desire strong revenue growth. That's because it's hard to be confident a company will be sustainable if revenue growth is negligible, and it never makes a profit.
In the last 5 years NEXTDC saw its revenue grow at 19% per year. Even measured against other revenue-focussed companies, that's a good result. So it's not entirely surprising that the share price reflected this performance by increasing at a rate of 21% per year, in that time. This suggests the market has well and truly recognized the progress the business has made. NEXTDC seems like a high growth stock - so growth investors might want to add it to their watchlist.
The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).
It's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. You can see what analysts are predicting for NEXTDC in this 
 
.
Investors should note that there's a difference between NEXTDC's total shareholder return (TSR) and its share price change, which we've covered above. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. NEXTDC hasn't been paying dividends, but its TSR of 170% exceeds its share price return of 164%, implying it has either spun-off a business, or raised capital at a discount; thereby providing additional value to shareholders.
It's nice to see that NEXTDC shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 48% over the last year. That's better than the annualised return of 22% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand NEXTDC better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 
 that you should be aware of before investing here.
NEXTDC is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this
