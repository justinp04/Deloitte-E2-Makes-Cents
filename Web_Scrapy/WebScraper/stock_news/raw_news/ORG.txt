Brookfield's $10.6 billion bid for Origin Energy expected to fail on Monday

By Scott Murdoch
SYDNEY (Reuters) -The outcome of a Brookfield consortium's $10.6 billion bid for Australia's Origin Energy will be officially known on Monday, with investors expected to vote down its year-long attempt to buy the country's largest power retailer.
Origin's shares shed 3% to A$7.94 in early trade Monday ahead of the vote, a fresh-nine month low for the company, indicating investors expect Brookfield and its bidding partner EIG to walk away after the vote.
Origin's largest shareholder, A$300 billion ($198 billion) pension fund AustralianSuper, has said it would reject the A$9.39 per share offer.
AustralianSuper owns about 17% of Origin, which should be enough to block the bid that requires at least 75% support from the votes cast at the investor meeting in Sydney.
Origin said on Nov. 23, when the vote was adjourned after the consortium lodged a revised proposal, that proxy votes showed the bid would have failed to win had the meeting gone ahead.
"The market has already factored in the bid failing and the stock is roughly fairly valued in our opinion, so I wouldn’t expect much impact if the bid fails," said Morningstar analyst Adrian Atkins.
"If the Brookfield consortium comes back with a hostile off-market offer, there could be upside to the share price."
Luke Edwards, Brookfield Australia head of renewable energy and transition, said on Friday if the deal was voted down the consortium would need to consider whether a new government plan to reshape energy markets negatively impacted its view of Origin's value.
"We will do this work before considering whether to continue pursuing a proposal to acquire Origin Energy or the Origin Energy Markets business," he said.
Origin did not respond to a request for comment ahead of the vote.
The company's board last week rejected a revised back-up bid from the Brookfield consortium that the energy firm said was too complex and highly conditional.

UPDATE 6-Origin investors reject $10.6 bln Brookfield bid, company open to other funding

*
Buyout offer fails to reach 75% threshold
*
AustralianSuper says it welcomed vote
(Adds Brookfield comment in paragraph 6)
By Scott Murdoch and Lewis Jackson
SYDNEY, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Brookfield will walk away from Origin Energy, a source familiar with the matter said, after shareholders in Australia's largest power retailer rejected a $10.6 billion takeover bid by a consortium led by the asset manager on Monday.
Final votes were 31.08% against the bid with 68.92% in favour, according to Origin's regulatory filings, lower than the 75% threshold required for a takeover to proceed.
The deal was expected to fail after Origin's largest shareholder, A$300 billion ($198 billion) pension fund AustralianSuper, said it would reject the A$9.39 per share offer. AustralianSuper owns about 17% of Origin, which was enough to block the bid.
In a statement, Brookfield said it would take into account a new government plan to accelerate the rollout of green energy before it decides what to do next.
A source familiar with the matter said the Canadian-based asset manager had no intention of returning with a renewed offer for Origin as it considered the government's green energy plans negative for Origin's future earnings.
The source declined to be identified as the information remained confidential. Brookfield declined to comment.
Brookfield's proposal, made with EIG Partners, promised to build 14 gigawatts of renewable energy as part of a 10-year, A$20 billion to A$30 billion investment plan.
Origin already has plans to develop 4 gigawatts by 2030, and Chairman Scott Perkins reaffirmed that strategy, adding that the company was open to working with other investors.
"The way we've seen the energy transition is there's been plenty of scope for third party capital to invest alongside Origin," Perkins told reporters after the vote.
"So all those pools of low cost of capital are interesting to Origin, they always have been. AusSuper would be absolutely one of the obvious sources of that capital," he said, adding that Origin had not held any talks with AustralianSuper so far.
In its statement, AustralianSuper said it would be a willing capital partner for Origin as it "prepares to transition over the coming decades".
"We have never wavered in our belief that the value and future value of Origin is better in the hands of members and other shareholders rather than a private equity consortium seeking to make a quick return based on the proposed scheme terms," an AustralianSuper spokesperson said.
Origin's board on Thursday rejected an alternative proposal lodged last week from the consortium to be considered if the current offer failed. The power retailer will continue as an independent listed company and the board, which recommended the bid, would remain in place, Perkins said.
Origin shares were down 3.9% ahead the investor vote. The shares are on a trading halt.

Brookfield Acknowledges Result of the Origin Energy Shareholder Vote

SYDNEY, Australia, and TORONTO, Dec. 04, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Brookfield Asset Management (NYSE: BAM, TSX: BAM), together with its listed affiliate Brookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE: BEP, BEPC; TSX BEP.UN, BEPC), acknowledges the announcement today by Origin Energy Limited (“Origin”) (ASX: ORG) of the result of Origin’s shareholder vote in respect of the previously announced Scheme of Arrangement with Brookfield, its institutional investors, and EIG. Origin’s shareholders voted 69% in favor of the transaction, which was short of the required 75% approval level required.
In light of the result of the vote, Brookfield will evaluate its next steps, if any, with respect to Origin, given the strong level of Origin shareholder support for its proposal and taking into account the potential impact to Origin of the Australian Government’s recently announced proposed expansion to its Capacity Investment Scheme and National Energy Transformation Partnership.
“We are seeing plentiful opportunities to deploy capital at or above our target returns, as demand for clean power from corporations continues to accelerate and access to capital is becoming increasingly scarce for some market participants. We remain confident that we will deploy at least $7 to $8 billion of equity capital into growth over the next five years, consistent with our targets,” said Connor Teskey, CEO Brookfield Renewable. “Specifically, our plan to accelerate the transition of Origin has generated significant interest from similar businesses around the world, who are seeking a capital and operating partner to enhance the value of their businesses by accelerating their transition.”
Brookfield Renewable operates one of the world’s largest publicly traded, pure-play renewable power platforms. Our portfolio consists of hydroelectric, wind, utility-scale solar and storage facilities in North America, South America, Europe and Asia, and totals approximately 31,800 megawatts of installed capacity and a development pipeline of approximately 143,400 megawatts of renewable power assets, 14 million metric tonnes per annum ("MMTPA") of carbon capture and storage, 2 million tons of recycled material and 4 million metric million British thermal units of renewable natural gas production annually.

Investors want Origin Energy to consider green push, asset sale post takeover failure

By Lewis Jackson
SYDNEY, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Investors want Origin Energy to consider hiving off its gas assets or raising its green energy deployment target, among other ideas, to make Australia's largest energy retailer more valuable after the collapse of a Brookfield-led takeover bid.
Origin Energy would return to "business as usual" and dust off its old strategy of building 4 gigawatts to 5 gigawatts of renewable power by 2030, chairman Scott Perkins said on Monday after opposition from pension giant AustralianSuper sunk the $10.6 billion bid from Brookfield and EIG.
Some investors said this plan was insufficient to maintain market share, pointing to Brookfield's more ambitious strategy. The Canadian-based asset manager had committed to 14 GW over a decade and pitched its bid as a way to accelerate decarbonisation at Australia's second-largest power producer.
"The old transition plan is not good enough. They need to be at the level that Brookfield was aiming at," said Jamie Hannah, deputy head of investments and capital markets at VanEck, which owns a 0.3% stake in Origin and voted for the deal.
"They should be speaking straight to AustralianSuper. They blocked the deal ... if they really want to help the energy market in Australia they can now."
Major Australian pension funds, including the A$300 billion AustralianSuper, said last week they are willing to spend big on energy transition but first want a series of policy reforms to make the sector more attractive to investors.
AustralianSuper welcomed the bid's failure on Monday and said the fund was open to providing Origin Energy capital for the transition. The fund declined to comment further.
A capital recycling partnership with AustralianSuper or another pension fund where Origin built projects and then sold stakes after completion could allow 15 GW worth of projects over the next decade if combined with a dividend reinvestment plan underwritten by a big fund, according to Tim Buckley, a director at think tank Climate Energy Finance.
But fund manager Allan Gray, which owns roughly 3% of Origin and voted for the deal, cautioned against an aggressive target that might encourage green, but mediocre, investments. Instead the board should consider splitting off its stake in Australia Pacific LNG, according to managing director Simon Mawhinney.
"The target can't be a number of gigawatts brought to market, there needs to be a return hurdle and that needs to be front and centre," he said.
Under the deal terms, Origin Energy would have been split and consortium partner EIG would have taken control of Origin's gas business.
Macquarie analyst Ian Myles last month also proposed the APLNG split alongside a big increase in the dividend payout policy. (Reporting by Lewis Jackson; editing by Miral Fahmy)

The public broadcaster says CBC and Radio-Canada will each cut about 250 jobs, with the balance of the 
 coming from its corporate divisions like technology and infrastructure.
It has also identified about 200 currently vacant positions that will be eliminated.
Along with the job cuts, CBC will be reducing its English and French programming budgets, resulting in fewer renewals and acquisitions, new television series, episodes of existing shows and digital original series.
It attributed the cuts to rising production costs, declining television advertising revenue and fierce competition from the digital giants.
At the end of March, CBC had some 6,500 permanent employees, about 2,000 temporary workers and roughly 760 contract staff.
The cuts at CBC come days after the Liberal government suggested it may cap the amount of money CBC and Radio-Canada could get under a $100 million deal Ottawa recently signed with Google.
The Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver says home sales ticked up last month as the continued increase of newly listed properties has given prospective homebuyers in the region among the largest selection to choose from since 2021.
The board says November home sales totalled 1,702, a 4.7 per cent increase from the same month last year, though it marked a slowdown from the prior month of October. The total was 33 per cent below the 10-year seasonal average of 2,538 for November.
There were 3,369 new listings of detached, attached and apartment properties last month, a 9.8 per cent increase from a year earlier, as new listings were 2.8 per cent below the 10-year seasonal average.
The composite benchmark home price in November for Metro Vancouver was $1,185,100, a 4.9 per cent increase from November 2022 and a one per cent decrease from October 2023.
Andrew Lis, the board’s director of economics and data analytics, says the region has seen balanced market conditions since the summer, which are known to produce flatter price trends.
He says with most economists forecasting mortgage rates to fall modestly in 2024, market conditions for buyers “are arguably the most favourable we’ve seen in some time in our market.”

Stocks slipped on Wall Street Monday ahead of some key reports this week on the United States job market that might provide more insight into the Federal Reserve’s thinking about interest rates.
U.S. Treasury yields were higher, putting some pressure on stocks. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgage rates, rose to 4.29 per cent from 4.21 per cent.
Technology companies were among the biggest weights on the market. Microsoft fell 2.6 per cent and Apple fell 1.8 per cent.

 says new car sales in November soared 20.7 per cent compared with last year, as vehicle supply improves.
Andrew King, managing partner at DesRosiers, says November saw the largest percentage gain in sales so far this year.
The data shows car sales continued to defy affordability woes and high borrowing costs, with November marking the thirteenth straight month of year-over-year gains.
King says improving vehicle availability and strong pent-up demand from the pandemic are continuing to fuel sales.
However, he adds the monthly total for car sales was still below the pre-pandemic November market.
King says this year’s car sales have already topped 2022 levels, even with December sales yet to come, pointing to an important recovery since the COVID-19 pandemic.
Wall Street kicked off the week with losses, with both stocks and bonds down in a signal that traders’ aggressive pricing of United States Federal Reserve rate cuts may have gone too far.
A raft of key jobs readings over the next few days will be closely watched for clues on the Fed’s next steps, with the potential to rekindle volatility that has recently shown signs of anemia. Technically “overbought” conditions and long positioning have left markets in a more fragile state after the impressive rallies in both Treasuries and equities last month.

JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Mislav Matejka said markets expecting a soft landing leave no room for error.
“Perhaps one should be contrarian yet again,” Matejka said.

Economist 
 says “unprecedented” layoffs at 
 are a sign the latest labour report numbers are not nearly as rosy as they seem at first glance.
The Canadian economy added 25,000 
 in November, Statistics Canada reported Dec. 1. But the unemployment rate ticked up to 5.8 per cent as jobs created couldn’t keep up with the rate of population growth.
Here’s what Rosenberg, president of Rosenberg Research & Associates, had to say about the report in this morning’s Breakfast with Dave newsletter:
“A real red flag is coming out of the banks: the financial sector has now chopped its headcount for four months in a row and by a combined 63,000, which is unprecedented. Going back to 1976 and spanning six recessions, we have never seen carnage like this before in the Canadian financial industry from a job-reduction perspective. And this sector is a leading indicator.
“There is something else. The workweek was cut the most since April 2022 and down to a nine-month low. Something like this rarely happens and is equivalent to having reduced the national head count by over 150,000. In other words, when counting not just the bodies but the hours spent working, it’s as if Canada shed 125,000 jobs last month.
“In a period when a country is experiencing an epic immigration boom like Canada has been in recent years, the most relevant labour market data point arguably is the employment-to-population ratio. And this metric has eroded from 62 per cent in September to 61.9 per cent in October to 61.8 per cent in November — nearly a two-year low. In other words, there was quite a bit of hair on a report that showed a false glow at the top-line level.”
Origin Energy Ltd. rejected a A$19.1 billion (US$12.8 billion) 
-led takeover, after the fund’s yearlong pursuit of a utility that’s vital to Australia’s energy transition.
About 69 per cent of ballots cast by investors were in support of the deal, below the required threshold of three-quarters of the votes, Origin said Dec. 4 in a statement, following a shareholder meeting.
Origin’s largest investor AustralianSuper, which holds about 17 per cent of the company, had opposed the offer as too low, effectively blocking the prospects for an acquisition. The intervention by Australia’s largest pension fund showcased an increasingly assertive approach from managers of the country’s A$3.5-trillion retirement savings pool.
Brookfield and EIG Global Energy Partners, which made a first offer in November last year, revised their proposal last month and the deal value was A$9.39 a share, based on Wednesday’s exchange rate, Origin said last week.
Origin’s board had supported the proposal, though last week rebuffed a suggested alternative transaction under which Brookfield would pay A$12.3 billion for the company’s energy generation and retailing business in the event of an unsuccessful takeover vote.
“Brookfield will evaluate its next steps, if any, with respect to Origin,” the Canada-based investment fund said in a statement. Executives have flagged Brookfield, which planned to acquire Origin using its Global Transition Fund, won’t return with any immediate new offer and intends to review the implications from new Australian energy policy.
Stocks and bonds retreated as traders pause after November’s blockbuster rally and debate the case for interest rate cuts. Bitcoin surged past US$41,000, while gold briefly touched an all time high.
The 10-year Treasury yield added five basis points to 4.25 per cent while United States futures posted modest losses.
The S&P/TSX composite index closed up 216.58 points at 20,452.87 on Friday.

Origin Energy Ltd's Dividend Analysis

Origin Energy Ltd(
) recently announced a 
 of $0.13 per share, payable on 2023-10-16, with the ex-dividend date set for 2023-09-05. As investors look forward to this upcoming payment, the spotlight also shines on the company's dividend history, yield, and growth rates. Using the data from GuruFocus, let's look into Origin Energy Ltd's dividend performance and assess its sustainability.
Origin Energy is a major vertically integrated Australian energy utility. Its energy retailing business is the largest in Australia, with about 4 million customers and a 33% market share. Its portfolio of base-load, intermediate, and peaking electricity plants is one of the largest in the national electricity market, with a capacity of 6,000 megawatts. Origin also operates and owns 27.5% of Australia Pacific LNG, which owns large coal seam gas fields and LNG export facilities in Queensland.
Origin Energy Ltd has maintained a consistent 
 record since 2019. Dividends are currently distributed on a bi-annual basis. Below is a chart showing annual 
 for tracking historical trends.
As of today, Origin Energy Ltd currently has a 12-month 
 of 4.25% and a 12-month 
 of 4.25%. This suggests an expectation of same dividend payments over the next 12 months. Over the past three years, Origin Energy Ltd's annual 
 was 3.20%. Based on Origin Energy Ltd's dividend yield and five-year growth rate, the 
 of Origin Energy Ltd stock as of today is approximately 4.25%.
To assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The 
 provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-06-30, Origin Energy Ltd's dividend payout ratio is 0.52.
Origin Energy Ltd's 
, offers an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers. GuruFocus ranks Origin Energy Ltd's profitability 5 out of 10 as of 2023-06-30, suggesting fair profitability. The company has reported net profit in 5 years out of the past 10 years.
To ensure the sustainability of dividends, a company must have robust growth metrics. Origin Energy Ltd's 
 of 5 out of 10 suggests that the company has a fair growth outlook. Revenue is the lifeblood of any company, and Origin Energy Ltd's 
, combined with the 
, indicates a strong revenue model. Origin Energy Ltd's revenue has increased by approximately 8.80% per year on average, a rate that underperforms approximately 54.55% of global competitors.
The company's 
 showcases its capability to grow its earnings, a critical component for sustaining dividends in the long run. During the past three years, Origin Energy Ltd's earnings increased by approximately -9.40% per year on average, a rate that underperforms approximately 79.26% of global competitors. Lastly, the company's 
 of -9.90%, which underperforms approximately 87.08% of global competitors.
In light of Origin Energy Ltd's upcoming dividend payment, investors should consider the company's consistent dividend history and the current yield that is reflective of market expectations. While the dividend growth rate is moderate, the payout ratio and profitability rank indicate a balance between dividend distribution and retained earnings for future investment. However, growth metrics present a mixed picture, with strong revenue per share but underperformance in earnings and EBITDA growth compared to global peers. These factors are vital for investors to weigh, as they could influence the sustainability of dividends in the long term. With a nuanced view of both the rewards and risks, investors can make more informed decisions regarding their investment in Origin Energy Ltd.

REFILE-UPDATE 3-Australia's Origin Energy half-year profit tops forecasts on higher power prices

(Corrects headline to UPDATE 3 instead of UPDATE 2, with no changes to text)
*
H1 underlying profit beats consensus
*
Origin raises energy markets full year guidance by 13%
*
Interim dividend, up 67%, tops forecasts
*
Shares jump 3.9%
By Lewis Jackson and Archishma Iyer
Feb 15 (Reuters) - Australia's Origin Energy on Thursday posted a 17-fold jump in underlying profit, raised its full year outlook and announced a bigger-than-expected dividend in its first result since its top shareholder blocked a $10.6 billion takeover.
The buoyant results go some way to validating the opposition of AustralianSuper to last year's A$9.39 per share bid led by Brookfield, which Australia's largest pension fund argued was too cheap.
"We expect Origin's strong first half performance to carry over into the second half," CEO Frank Calabria said in a statement.
"I am confident in Origin's prospects and believe we are uniquely positioned to capture value from the energy transition."
The country's top power retailer reported underlying profit of A$747 million ($485 million) for the six months ended Dec. 31, compared with A$44 million a year ago and well ahead of the consensus estimate of A$688 million cited by UBS.
Its shares jumped 3.9% in early trade and were last up 2.7% at A$8.81, outperforming a 0.8% rise in the broader market .
While all segments grew, the result was driven by a resurgence in energy markets, which includes power generation and energy retailing.
Underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) there grew almost fivefold to A$1.04 billion from A$231 million a year earlier on higher electricity prices and lower fuel costs at its coal plants.
Origin raised full year guidance for the division to between A$1.6 billion ($1.04 billion) and A$1.8 billion, versus its prior forecast of between A$1.30 billion and A$1.70 billion.
In the gas business, which includes a 27.5% stake in the Australia Pacific Liquefied Natural Gas (APLNG) project, underlying EBITDA also rose 5%.
Origin, which recently raised its stake in UK energy retailer Octopus Energy to 23%, expects the business to contribute less than A$100 million in EBITDA for the full year.
Origin declared an interim dividend of 27.5 Australian cents per share, up from 16.5 Australian cents last year and ahead of the consensus 20 Australian cents per share cited by UBS.

This Wealth-Creating Dividend Stock Swings and Misses at a Big Acquisition. Is It Still Worth Buying?

Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEPC) (NYSE: BEP) fell short in its attempt to win shareholder approval for its takeover of Australian utility Origin Energy. The global renewable energy producer was working with several partners to take that company private to accelerate its transition to lower-carbon energy. The deal would have helped move the needle for Brookfield by providing near-term cash flow and long-term growth potential.

Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript

 
Q4 2023 Earnings Call
, 
Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Brookfield Renewables fourth-quarter 2023 earnings call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.
[Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your host today, Connor Teskey, chief executive officer. Please go ahead.
 -- 
Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our fourth-quarter 2023 conference call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that a copy of our news release, investor supplement, and letter to unitholders can be found on our website. We would also like to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements on this call. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks, and our future results may differ materially.
For more information, you are encouraged to review our regulatory filings available on SEDAR, EDGAR, and on our website. On today's call, we will provide a review of our 2023 performance and an update on the business and our growth initiatives before handing it over to Stephen Gallagher, CEO of Brookfield Renewable U.S., who will discuss how we are enabling the growth of the largest and fastest-growing companies around the world and what that means for our business. And then, lastly, Wyatt will conclude the call by discussing our operating results and financial position. As always, following our remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. 2023 was a record year for our business on many metrics.
Before you buy stock in Brookfield Renewable Partners, consider this:
The 
 analyst team just identified what they believe are the 
 for investors to buy now... and Brookfield Renewable Partners wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.
 provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month. The 
 service has more than tripled the return of S&P 500 since 2002*.
We generated record funds from operations, benefiting from organic growth and acquisitions; we deployed a record amount of capital into attractive and accretive opportunities across all our key markets; and we developed more capacity than we ever have before, all while strengthening our balance sheet. We have established ourselves as a global clean energy supermajor evolving from a pure-play renewable energy producer to a preeminent platform for renewable power and decarbonization solutions with scale and a breadth of capabilities and relationships that set us apart from our peers. In a year where we saw rising interest rates and supply chain challenges facing the sector, we were able to execute across our business plan. Most notably, our disciplined approach to development, which focuses on removing risks up front, meant that our development activities remained robust, delivering a record year and preserving our returns, all at a time when some market participants saw headwinds. We also saw the benefit of our prudent approach to financing our business, which combined with the strength of our balance sheet, durability of our cash flows, and diverse sources of scale capital ensured that we were able to continue to pursue growth at a time when some could not and there was less competition. We deployed -- or agreed to deploy 9 billion of capital alongside our partners, highlighted by our acquisitions of Westinghouse, Deriva Energy, the remaining 50% interest in X-Elio which we did not own, Banks Renewables, and investments in CleanMax and Avaada in India. And while our proposed acquisition of Origin Energy did not receive the required level of shareholder support, we are confident in achieving our target deployment of $7 billion to $8 billion over the next five years and growing our cash flows and distributions in line with our targets. Since the initial announcement of the Origin transaction, we have received inbounds from businesses around the world who are seeking a partner with significant capital and deep operating expertise to accelerate their transition goals and enhance the value of their businesses.
With respect to our development, we continue to scale up our capabilities and delivered almost 5,000 megawatts of new capacity in the past year, up from 3,500 megawatts in 2022, while we -- and we also pulled forward the rest of our pipeline. Our advanced stage pipeline is materially de-risked with over 25% of the next three years' planned capacity already under construction, an additional over 20% with revenues and inputs fully contracted, and an incremental over 30% in the final stages of securing PPAs and construction contracts. Between our rerisked, highly visible development pipeline, the growth opportunities we are seeing in the market and our organic growth levers, we are confident in achieving our 10%-plus FFO per unit growth in 2024 and beyond. With that, we are pleased to announce an over 5% increase to our annual distribution to $1.42 per unit. This is the 13th consecutive year of at least 5% annual distribution growth dating back to 2011 when Brookfield Renewable was publicly listed. Now, we will turn it over to Stephen to discuss how we are enabling the growth of the global technology companies and what that means for our business.
 -- 
Thank you, Connor, and good morning, everyone. With the significant growth in demand for data globally, the position of the technology mega-cap as the largest and fastest-growing businesses in the world continues to solidify. Since 2020, the cloud computing segments of these companies have grown by over 30% per annum, representing their highest growth segments and generating their highest margins. Increasing demand for cloud computing from digitalization and the adoption of AI-enabled tools are driving these companies to continue to invest heavily in their capabilities and capacity. And the two -- and two of the key ingredients needed to deliver these products are computing power and energy.
Over the last 12 months, the race to increase computing power has been illustrated by the increase in demand for certain inputs such as computer chips. However, we believe most investors have yet to grasp the importance of a secure energy source in enabling the delivery of the data center and computing power growth. The largest cloud computing businesses run on clean power. These companies have committed to 100% clean energy targets and have grown their consumption by approximately 50% per annum over the last couple of years, making them the largest buyers of green power globally. And now, the highly power-intensive nature of AI Is acting as a multiplier on energy demand, which is increased -- increasingly becoming a key bottleneck for growth of cloud computing. For example, the integration of AI uses up to 10 times more power when integrated into a typical search process.
And renewable power as the cheapest form of bulk electricity production is the solution to this growing electricity demand. Furthermore, as the scale and energy intensities of data centers increases, these facilities put pressure on the global electricity grids. As a result, certain regulators are now requiring data center developers to provide a power solution in order to receive their data center permits. This has put access to power on the critical path to growth for these technology companies. This is leading our partners to engage in commercial conversations earlier in the process to develop solutions with us, which is the dual benefit of both de-risking the technology companies' power needs and also our development pipeline. It is widely estimated that global electricity consumption from data centers will increase to approximately 10% of total electricity demand by 2030, up from approximately 2% today.
To put this in context, this means that to satisfy the needs of data centers alone, which does not factor in the penetration of EVs or broader electrification, additional generation capacity will be required equivalent to the size of the current U.S. grid. For the better part of a decade, we have been positioning our business to capitalize on these trends. By building a leading global development platform, combined with our early focus on corporate power marketing capabilities, this has allowed us to serve the needs of the largest and fastest-growing buyers of green power.
The global technology companies have been among the largest corporate customers of our businesses now for years as we have differentiated ourselves with our -- our scale and credibility, delivering new energy projects on time to enable their growth. Our ability to deliver 24/7 clean power solutions at scale and across geographies positions our business to continue to be a major beneficiary of this robust demand growth. Further, our ability to provide unique and tailored solutions at scale allows us to avoid competition and drive better returns in the bilateral markets. We have signed contracts to provide over 60 terawatt hours of power over the past two years to these large technology companies, an amount we expect to increase dramatically in the coming years. As a result, going forward, we expect the vast majority of our new renewable power development will be contracted to corporate customers where we are seeing strong demand from our differentiated offerings at attractive contract terms. Currently, we have approximately 22 terawatt-hours per year of generation contracted to corporate customers, representing approximately 30% of our total contract volumes over double the volumes contracted to these types of customers five years ago. Based on our existing development pipeline, we expect contracted generation to corporate customers to double again by 2028 to approximately 44 terawatt-hours per year, or 45% of the -- our contracted volumes.
With that, I will pass it on to Wyatt to discuss our operating results and financial position.
 -- 
Thank you, Stephen, and good morning, everyone. Our operations continued to perform well this quarter, benefiting from the diversification of our fleet and strong all-in-power prices. We delivered solid results in the fourth quarter with FFO of $0.38, up 9% year over year. And on a full-year basis, we delivered record FFO at $1.1 billion, or $1.67 per unit, a 7% increase over the prior year. While our results fell slightly below our target of 10%-plus FFO per unit growth for the year, largely due to later-than-expected transaction closings during the fourth quarter, we remain well positioned to achieve our goal going into 2024 and beyond.
We are already seeing the benefits of our growth activities, which were back-end weighted this year as we commissioned nearly half of our almost 5,000 megawatts of new capacity in the fourth quarter. We're also seeing strong cash flows from the closing of the previously mentioned major acquisitions that took place in the final three months of the year and are expected to contribute over $100 million in incremental annual FFO. We also expect to receive an uplift as our fleet reverts to long-term average generation, particularly from our hydro assets where we often see cyclicality. During the year, we continue to execute on our growth initiatives, as Connor highlighted, while simultaneously strengthening our balance sheet. We executed almost $15 billion in non-recourse financings, generating almost $500 million enough financing proceeds to Brookfield Renewable. We were also successful with our capital recycling program, which we continue to scale with our development growth, generating $800 million of proceeds over the past 12 months, representing over three times our invested capital. We take a disciplined and practical approach to asset rotation, looking to sell assets when they are in demand and attracting valuations at or above our internal assessments regardless of technology or geography.
This approach has served us well and generated returns above our underwriting targets for investors. During the second half of the year, we saw a disconnect between the price of our shares in the public markets and the underlying value of our business and took that opportunity to repurchase 2 million units under our normal course issuer bid. Looking forward, we will continue to allocate capital based on where we're seeing the best risk-adjusted returns and remain confident we will continue to create meaningful value for our investors going forward. In closing, we remain focused on delivering 12% to 15% long-term total returns for our investors while remaining disciplined allocators of capital, leveraging our deep funding sources and operational capabilities to enhance and de-risk our business. On behalf of the board and management, we thank all our unitholders and shareholders for the ongoing support. We are excited about Brookfield Renewable's future and look forward to updating you on our progress throughout 2024. That concludes our formal remarks for today's call.
Thank you for joining us this morning. And with that, I'll pass it back to our operator for questions.
[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sean Steuart with TD Securities.
 -- 
Thank you. Good morning. A few questions on the corporate PPA environment. Can you give us perspective on price terms, how that's trended? I know there's an upward trend, but specific to the contracts you're -- you're signing, how that trend for pricing has evolved and how that tension relates to contract duration? I know there's been a general trend toward longer-term contracts.
how does that interplay with the price terms you can -- you can attain right now?
 -- 
Good morning, Sean. Thanks for the question. So, maybe we'll come at this in a slightly different way, but -- but we'll answer your question head-on. What we are seeing is a result of significant increases in new electricity demand.
This is being driven by the data center demand. This is being driven by increased penetration of EVs. This is being driven by electrification of industrial processes, is right now, there is far more corporate offtake demand than there are ready-to-build projects. In key locations -- there is simply a -- some supply demand imbalance in favor of those that have ready-to-build projects in key locations.
And the way this shows up in terms of pricing is the dynamic that we've been seeing for a number of years now, which is we are able to pass through higher capex costs, higher funding costs through to the off-taker in the form of higher PPA prices while preserving our development margin. And therefore, we are able to continually service this increased amount of demand and put more projects through into that increased amount of demand at the same development returns that we were seeing previously, if not even a little bit higher today because of that really robust supply demand dynamic. So, that's what we're seeing in terms of pricing. It will obviously depend on the respective power market and things like capex and funding costs within those respective markets. But what we are seeing because of that increased demand is the ability to preserve or even perhaps marginally enhance our development margins. And then, in terms of contract duration, one thing, we have been very uncompromising about -- for -- for years now is there's been this perception that as renewables over the last 10 years came off government feed-in tariffs increasingly onto corporate contracts, that meant that contract durations got shorter.
We simply aren't seeing that, and we're seeing significant demand for long-term corporate contracts, 15, 17, 18, 20 years. And those are obviously very attractive to us and can be financed very attractively if we deal with high credit quality counterparties. And that's really the bulk of demand that we're seeing today.
 -- 
Thanks for that detail. And then, just one follow-on with respect to data centers. I know, at least in the U.S., the location of those data centers tends to be quite concentrated in specific regions. How do you expect that will evolve? And can you give perspective on Brookfield's ability to meet demand in those specific areas?
 -- 
Sean, it's a really astute question because you're absolutely right. This demand, while significant is not equal in all places. The power needs to be in a place where it can service that -- that corporate demand load. But -- but we are seeing a number of dynamics.
First and foremost, the ability to work with the counterparties where -- where is there the potential to co-locate new data centers near power generation that can be built, and our really strong relationships with the large corporate off-takers is we can proactively work with them to identify those locations. And then, either through M&A or through greenfield development prospecting, we can look to create development pipeline in those regions to -- to -- to service that demand. The second point I would make in regards to your question here is the opportunity to service this corporate demand is really today. It's not something that we're seeing for the future. This is happening in real time. So, in order to service this corporate demand, it's not simply having the capability or the capital to do it.
You actually need to already have a very large pipeline of projects. And this is where our strategy for the last few years is really coming to fruition, where we have been focused on buying premium developers with large development pipelines in core markets, really to ensure that we are well positioned to meet this demand as it has accelerated. And today, those pipelines are very valuable because they are in the ground, they are existing, they are working through their development process, and they can meet that demand in the near term as opposed to simply planning for projects three to five or seven years out.
 -- 
That's great detail. Thanks, Connor. I -- I will get back in the queue.
Our next question comes from the line of Robert Hope with Scotiabank.
 -- 
Good morning, everyone. I want to stick on the data center theme for today. Excuse me. So, when you're looking at your development pipeline and the contracting strategy there, like, how -- can you maybe add a little bit of color of how it's moved away from, you know, single assets to more groups of assets to serve this demand? And then, when you think about the opportunity set in front of you, you know, do large developers such as yourself with a large pipeline, should you disproportionately benefit versus the smaller developers in this -- you know, we'll call it, increasing opportunity sets so that, you know, in essence, your market share should increase?
 -- 
Sure. So, good morning, Robin, and thanks for the question. You are right that this dynamic is going to lead to concentrations in -- in certain regions, this data center demand dynamic. And -- and to be clear, there is -- without question, the greatest concentration of data center growth that needs power supply is in the United States. And we are very fortunate that over half of our development pipeline, globally, sits in the United States.
The second thing to highlight here is, yes, well, individual projects might be signing contracts to support individual data centers. The corporate counterparty that backstops that contract is the corporate holdco of these large tech companies. We have a corporate guarantee from the, you know, trillion-dollar-plus market cap companies around the world. It is not a ring-fenced counterparty credit individualized to a singular data center. And I think that's a really important dynamic to understand because we take great comfort that, as this growing opportunity set continues to expand, these are, literally, the best counterparties around the world.These are not individual assets.
These are the -- the -- the large tech companies themselves that -- that are the counterparties. And then, to your question about scale, this is going to play into the hands of the larger players, but I think the reason for that is perhaps a little bit nuanced. And we would really focus on two things. The power demand that is required by these large tech companies is truly remarkable.
Sometimes it's tough to put the -- the magnitudes in, in context. And therefore, if you are a large technology company looking to -- to secure your power supply, you can either work with, literally, thousands of individual small developers, or you can work with a smaller number of very large developers. And we are very fortunate to be in that group or even at the top of the list when it comes to that group that can provide to meet the needs of these large technology companies at a scale that few others can and really move the needle For them in terms of deep bottlenecking their future growth. So, that would be point one. The other point that should not be underestimated and why we are so constructive on this market is, the most important thing to these counterparties is that projects are delivered -- they are delivered on time and the developer does not walk away from the projects if, you know, they can't get the equipment or they -- they -- they get knocked off schedule because of supply chain or shipping issues.
And our global capabilities and our ability to push through issues using our operational capabilities when they arise ensures that we are among the most reliable counterparties to these large tech companies, the power will be delivered on schedule. And I would say that is a completely underappreciated benefit for -- for large players such as us because the worst thing for the tech company is if the power isn't there and the data center can't turn on. And this is why we're finding them to be very constructive in terms of contract terms when working with large reliable counterparties such as ourselves, because the most important thing to them is that reliability and that the project will be delivered on time. And that's a reputation and a capability we've been reinforcing and enhancing for years now.
 -- 
Appreciate that. Maybe as a follow-up and more broadly, with the current equity markets, you know, how are you thinking about allocating capital in 2024? Does the returns kind of skew more to the development side or to the buy side right now? Or how are you seeing that opportunity set?
 -- 
Certainly. Really, what we've seen, particularly in the last, call it, maybe four weeks of Q4 and into 2024 is -- what we've seen as a stabilization in interest rates. You know, in 2023, rates were going up and up and up, and the great part about our business is it -- it -- this is a real returns business. It works whether interest rates are at 3% or 4% or 5%. But everyone can appreciate that when markets are uncertain and rates seem like they're going up in perpetuity, that becomes a more tougher market for people to transact in.
And as we kind of turn the page into a new calendar year here, what we have is stability in interest rates. Maybe they land at three and three-quarters, maybe they land at 4.5, but they're -- they're going to be within a pretty tight range here, and that is a very constructive level for our industry. And as a result, we think this year will be very very active from a transaction perspective, both on the investment side and on the capital recycling side. You know, some of the uncertainty, particularly in the latter half of 2023, probably caused a number of people to stand on the sidelines. Early indications in 2024 is, with this reduced uncertainty in the market, people are open for business.
And we're seeing that in our sales processes that have launched, and we're also seeing that in our engagement in terms of new growth opportunities. In terms of where specifically we're seeing those opportunities, I would say it's across the spectrum. And public companies still do remain a key focus of ours even with somewhat of the -- the relief rally in the latter part of the year. But I would say at -- where interest rates are settling, it's a pretty good level for both buying both operating assets and development assets.
I think we would be pretty balanced this year going forward.
 -- 
Excellent. Thank you.
Our next question comes from the line of Rupert Merer with National Bank.
 -- 
Hi, good morning, everyone. Now one more follow-up on the -- the data center. So, the PPAs you're looking at, are they typically simple take-or-pay contracts, or is there some element of -- of capacity required?
 -- 
You know, most of them are, you know, 17, 18, 20-year take-or-pay inflation-linked contracts. These are -- these are the good ones that we want. Some of the large technology companies are increasingly looking for 24/7 green power solutions, and we can use our wind and solar development and pair that with either hydro or battery storage. But I would say that's typically at a premium or with incremental upside to those, call it, 17 to 18 to 20-year take-or-pay inflation-linked contracts.
 -- 
OK, great. Thank you. And then, secondly, looking at your production in the quarter, so you came in around 85% of LTA. We are seeing similar trends across your peer group, of course.
Just wondering if you can comment on those recent weather patterns and what you anticipate going forward, maybe some -- some thoughts about your -- your LTA assumptions.
 -- 
Perfect. And -- and thanks for the question and maybe let us share and shine a little bit of light here because there's really two different dynamics happening within our LTA. One of the -- the key differentiating factors of Brookfield Renewable and one of the things that is really the bedrock of our business is we have that very large critical base of baseload hydro. And, well, that is very very valuable.
Relative to wind and solar, hydrology is a slightly more variable asset class in terms of resource. But -- but there's two things I would focus on when it comes to our hydro LTA. One, we monitor it exceptionally closely, and we are constantly needing to update it for any financings or transactions that we do. And therefore, ver any period of time, yes, there can be some variability a little below LTA, a little above LTA, but those long-term averages are bang on.
But even when the resource can be a little above or a little below LTA. The other thing that needs to be overlayered on that dynamic is where is that resource above or below LTA. If -- if our hydro resource is below LTA in a very high-value market versus being above LTA in -- in, I'll say, lower-value market, that can have a differing impact on our financial results. So, well, that hydrology is a little bit more variable. It is very consistent over the long term.
And the one point we would reference here is, as our business continues to grow and diversify, the importance of that hydro LTA is being increasingly diluted over time. The second component of our LTA is a little bit more structural. And it's showing up a little bit more in -- in our current results today for obvious reasons, which is, as we buy new businesses, one of the things we often focus on is finding investment opportunities where there are clear operational enhancements that we can execute in the short to medium term under our ownership. So -- so, often, when we buy new businesses, they do start at slightly below LTA.
And as we take over those businesses from their previous ownership and then as we execute our business plans and implement those -- those operational improvements, those businesses trend up to that LTA number. As we've gone through a period of very very rapid growth here over the last, call it, 12 to 36 months, we have more of that in our numbers today than we would have had, let's say, three or five years ago. But the great news is that's all identified, that's all within our control, and we will see those numbers trend up to LTA as we execute on some of the repowering, refurbishments, equipment replacements that we identified in our underwriting. And that's all moving very very much on track and should increasingly play out in -- in our financial performance going forward.
 -- 
So, looking at that second component and the -- the overall shortfall to LTA, how much of it was a result of curtailments? We do see quite significant curtailment of wind power in some markets. And of course, that's something that can be controlled, to some degree, with the addition of batteries or maybe new transmission lines. Is this -- is this a significant component of the shortfall for you?
 -- 
I would say no. I don't have a specific figure to provide here. But without doubt, the most significant components of the discount to LTA are, one, just resource variability. And then, secondly, those specific identified operational improvements that we are pushing through our assets curtailment, of course, does exist in this business, but I wouldn't say it's a material driver of our -- our LTA results.
Well, I hope that answers your question. There's perhaps one thing I would add, which is you commented on batteries and increasingly the implementation of storage. That is a very strong dynamic we are seeing in our business. The -- in particular, the addition of batteries on an increasing proportion of the new development activity we do, we're seeing that as a very lo- risk and attractive return -- risk-adjusted return way to enhance a number of the assets that we've either recently acquired or are developing?
 -- 
Great. Thank you for the color. I'll leave it there.
Our next question comes from the line of Mark Jarvi with CIBC.
 -- 
Thanks, everyone. Maybe just, Connor, building off your comment around interest rate stability, sort of opening up the M&A markets a little bit more, how would you frame the interest competitive dynamics around larger assets and portfolios? Is it the same as it was six months ago? Do you think the number of, I guess, potential interested parties has increased in the last couple of months?
 -- 
I would say the stabilization in interest rates absolutely has increased the number of interested parties. There's no question about that. I would say we have really seen a fairly dramatic shift. Here we are the -- the beginning of February, end of January.
If you compare the market today versus where we were at, say, the end of September four months ago, it is night and day in terms of the level of activity, the amount of -- of interested parties, again, on both the buy side or the sell side. Maybe the only added point of color that -- that we would make there, and it ties back to -- to our answer to one of the previous questions, is really what we saw in 2023 was a number of businesses saw headwinds that we thought could largely be attributed to one of two things. If you took significant basis risk in your development activities, you know, the higher capex levels -- increasing capex levels and higher funding costs really caught you short. And that really disrupted or negatively impacted a number of developers around the world, particularly those in the offshore space. That was one dynamic that was a key headwind to 2023.
The other dynamic was simply the higher interest rates more materially impacted those businesses that were reliant on, you know, unfettered access to the capital markets and very very cheap financing. And businesses that had relied on that sort of funding structure, you know, suffered in last year's economic environment. Those two dynamics have seen a little bit of relief in the last, again, call it, two to three months, but we should be very clear that those dynamics haven't gone completely away. We have not returned yet and I don't think we will return to the almost-zero interest rates and unlimited access to capital that was there three or four years ago. So, some of those business models still don't work, and we'll need either capital or operating partners to -- to get back on a stable footing.
So, while there is more activity in the markets, I would say it's also still a relatively robust investment opportunity set.
 -- 
OK. A couple of follow-ups on that. Maybe does that mean, like, an opportunity to do the deep transactions is not as readily available at that valuation today? And I guess on the flip side, how does the market conditions inform, I guess, the pace and the type of assets you're considering for capital recycling in 2024?
 -- 
Yeah. Both great questions. I would say the comments I made stand by everything and I would say are very very vastly applicable. Transactions like what we did on the Duke transaction or the Banks transactions, those were essentially bilateral deals of very significant scale where we offered something that, essentially, the other participants in the market could not. And while there are more people active in the market today, there is still a very very large opportunity set for us to do bilateral deals where either the transaction structure we can own, the operating capabilities we can bring, or the scale we can provide is relatively unmatched.
So, you know, for many transactions, is there more competition today? Yes, but are we seeing an inability to do bilateral transactions as we have done in the past? No -- no, we -- we -- we are not.
 -- 
And then, just maybe on asset sales, in terms of the pace of, you know, potential asset sales this year versus last year, do you think that accelerates?
 -- 
A hundred percent. Sorry, I forgot to answer the second part of your question. Absolutely. And this is where we have seen some really strong demand to -- to start 2024 is there does seem to be still a lot of capital flowing into this sector, and that capital maybe took a pause for a couple quarters in -- in that more uncertain interest rate environment.
It has not taken long for that -- that capital to -- to come back. So, we would expect to be relatively active on the capital recycling side in -- in 2024. And in terms of where -- where we see that activity, same -- same strategy that that we've always executed. We will be unemotional in terms of geography, asset class, or technology. And we will look for opportunities where we can sell assets at -- at greater values than we see in holding them in our own portfolio.
In terms of where some of those dollars might be, I would say, just given the relative dispersion of our portfolio that, today, is largely in North America and Western Europe, surely because of that concentration, that's probably where we'd see the greatest amount of asset recycling.
 -- 
OK. Maybe I'll just sneak one more. Just in recent sort of updates, you guys have had a positive turn around maybe stepping into larger offshore wind investments. Is that still something that you're really active on? Has any -- any kind of change in terms of the -- the likelihood of making a -- you know, a larger play in offshore wind sometime in 2024?
 -- 
Sure. So -- so, our approach to offshore wind, and we'll quickly restate it here, we love the technology. It's large, it's fast-growing, it's mature. And quite frankly, because of the differentiated load pattern it can provide to onshore wind and onshore solar, it is actually critical to many power markets around the world. What we have struggled with in the past is the -- the investment profile or the basis risk you had to take as an investor or as a developer, where sometimes you had to invest hundreds of millions or billions of dollars upfront to the -- for the right to build out a project in four or five or six years.
And in that time period, in that lag, market conditions could -- could shift and go against you. Obviously, today, there are a number of market participants who have seen headwinds that -- that maybe need to get out of some of their offshore wind projects. And maybe some of those offshore wind projects are a lot closer to construction or a lot closer to coming online. And therefore, there is less of that basis risk that we had an aversion to. So, I would say we are much more active in reviewing opportunities in the offshore space today than we -- we would be -- would have been a couple of years ago. But like anything, we'll compare those opportunities to -- to the risk-adjusted returns we see elsewhere and allocate to the best ones.
 -- 
Understood. Thanks for the time today.
Our next question will come from the line of Nelson Ng with RBC Capital Markets.
 -- 
Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I had a few questions on your development pipeline.
So, obviously, you've highlighted a lot of opportunities in the U.S. But I was just looking at your development pipeline and South America is pretty thin. I don't -- I don't think there are any wind or utility-scale projects in the advanced stage there. So, I was just wondering, is there a lack of opportunities there, or are you just mainly focused on developing in North America and Europe at the moment?
 -- 
Hi. Hi. Very good question and relatively easy to answer. Obviously, the vast majority of our development activity traditionally in South America has been in Brazil.
And for the last few years, we -- we have, I would say, been very very successful in developing some -- some large and attractive projects in that market. For -- for those that don't know, power prices in Brazil, due to their very strong concentration of -- of hydroelectric generation across the grid, are very dependent on hydrology levels. And if you went back, I would say, two to four -- two to five years ago, hydrology levels across the Brazilian system were relatively low. And that supported higher power prices that made wind and solar development very very very attractive.
And that's the market where we developed many of those large projects into that have come online in '22 or 2023 or are scheduled to come online in 2024. But what has since happened, I would say, in the last 18 months is hydrology has dramatically improved in Brazil. And because that is across the system, it pushes power prices down. And today, they are at very very low historical levels. Obviously, our business in Brazil is almost 100% contracted.
So, we are not exposed to those lower power prices, but it does make it more difficult to find new wind and solar projects that can secure contracts in this price environment and still be developed at attractive levels. So, this is a short-term dynamic. Wind and solar growth in Brazil will recover and it will be very robust. But this has been driven by a relatively large shift in hydrology levels that has changed the market prices. And we are simply in a period of time where development activity in that market is going to be reduced because it's simply tough to -- to secure contracts at attractive enough levels to -- to justify the capex.
 -- 
That's really good color, Connor. I'm glad they're getting more water, but too bad, yeah, it slows down development. So, the next question is the -- obviously, you've commissioned about 4.5 gigawatts in '23, and that's growing to, I think, 6.6 and 7.6 gigawatts over the next two years. I know you have your a target of roughly deploying, call it, 1.5 billion per year on average.
So, of that 1.5 billion, roughly what portion of that is now -- is -- is going to development?
 -- 
Yeah, sure. So, I would say going into the next couple of years, '24, '25, approximately a third, give or take, is already kind of identified in organic growth opportunities. That number could -- could prove to be a little bit light, but I would say it's -- it's about a third.
 -- 
OK, and then just one last question. I -- I noticed that you are also involved in solar panel manufacturing to some degree. It looks like there's about 1.5 gigawatts and 2.5 gigawatts next year. Like, are you self-supplying some of your developments, or is this more of a hedge on costs? Or how do you -- how do you look at the -- your involvement in solar panel manufacturing?
 -- 
Sure. So, probably the easiest way to answer that question is let's talk about the exposure we have today as well as our -- our approach going forward. Our exposure today to solar panel manufacturing is part of a structured -- a large structured investment we made in a company called Avaada Energy in India. Avaada Energy is one of the largest independent renewable power owner-operators and developers, and that is the vast majority of the bulk of their business.
But in addition to being that large-scale owner and developer of renewable power, they also have two other business lines: One, they are doing some solar panel manufacturing themselves; and two, they are also in the early stages of some green hydrogen production. All of this, in India. So, our exposure to this space is through Avaada, where we have made a downside-protected structured investment to fund their growth across all three of those verticals. But the vast majority of that business today is a -- I would say relatively down the fairway leading renewable power developer in -- in India.
In terms of -- so -- and while we do have a good relationship with Avaada and we'd happily use some of those solar panels when they are up and running and producing, our -- our investment exposure is -- is, I would say, very very modest relative to our global procurement needs. Well, that's our exposure today. We are seeing around the world a trend toward just the scaling up of the supply chain for both renewable power and other decarbonization solutions. And we could see ourselves in the future look to be an investor in the scaling up of that supply chain, but only if we can do so on a very attractive risk-adjusted return basis and with an investment profile that we are comfortable with. And that essentially means we would only do it if the -- our investment was backstopped by long-term take-or-pay offtake contracts, very similar to what we look for when we build a new solar plant or build a new wind farm.
So, we would not rule out investing in supply chain in the future, but only if we can do so with an investment profile commensurate with what we typically target. And that means it would have to be backed by long-term offtake contracts.
 -- 
That's a great color. I'll leave it there. Thanks, Connor.
Our next question will come from the line of David Quezada with Raymond James.
 -- 
Thanks. Morning, everyone. Maybe the first one for me just on the comments in the release around inbounds that you've gotten inbound calls since the Origin deal was announced. Just curious if there's any -- any color you can provide on what kind of opportunities you see there.
Maybe in terms of the nature of those deals, geographical location, the scale of those opportunities, any color on that?
 -- 
For sure. What we would say is -- is well, the -- the outcome of the Origin vote was disappointing. Going through that process and the highly public nature of it, we really demonstrated, one, not only the business plan we were willing to sign up for but also the -- the operating capabilities and capital commitment we would throw behind one of those large-scale business transformation or power transformation opportunities. The other thing that I think was demonstrated throughout Origin is, well, yes, it did represent buying perhaps a different initial business than when we buy a pure-play renewables developer. What became very clear in our explanation of what we were doing there is our business plan was really predicated on the exact same thing we do everywhere else around the world. It was predicated on being a leading, high-quality, best-in-class renewable power developer and just doing that within a different company or business construct.
I think that was very illustrative and illuminating to the market because we have received inbounds, and I would say those inbounds are across North America, South America, Europe, and Australia since the announcement of Origin. The one point I would highlight, however, David, is these are very large and strategic decisions for our company to make. This is really changing the trajectory of the business. You know, a large-scale capex program to transition businesses that -- leading businesses in their market to less carbon-intensive and more de-risked and more valuable business strategies but over a multi-year period.
Therefore, those types of transactions, they -- they don't happen overnight. They involve a long-term courtship period, education process, working with those companies, before a transaction can be agreed upon or come to fruition. So, while we are having a number of those conversations today, I would suggest that we're excited about them, but they do tend to be longer-lead-time deals.
 -- 
Excellent. Thanks for that, Conor. And then, maybe just one more for me. Any -- any quick thoughts on -- I mean, I know certainly sounds like the M&A pipeline is alive and well, and you know, with the stabilizing rate environment, things have been better. But I'm just curious what -- what you think the, I guess, uncertainty around the U.S.
election, how could that affect things as the year goes on, maybe uncertainty around what happens with the tax credits.
 -- 
Yeah, certainly. Great question. And we will revert back to -- to a point that I think it's really critical not to lose sight of. And --and it ties to a bunch of the major themes we've been discussing on today's call.
Today, energy -- energy transition, decarbonization, and renewable power development is, undoubtedly, driven by corporate demand. Far far far more than it is by government push. And therefore -- while politics does have a role to play, it is in no way going to disrupt the rapid growth and the current trend line of investment and opportunity in those sectors. However, I do think it is important to -- to, you know, respond to some of the rhetoric and headlines in the market today depending on what might happen in the U.S.
elections. And I do think there's two very important things to highlight. One, under IRA today, the vast majority of IRA funds are going to Republican states. So, while there may be changes to that bill, under a different leadership, we wouldn't expect it to change dramatically. And then, the second thing to highlight is what's fantastic about the current situation in the United States is we've seen what happens for renewables growth under both a Republican or a Democratic leadership in recent years. And even going back to when there was Republican leadership in the United States, that was one of the fastest-growing periods for -- for renewable power in that country.
So, I think that does reiterate that while government policy can have an effect on things, that trend line of corporate demand is going to set the pace and growth of this industry and government policy is simply going to put a little bit of ebb and flow around that trend line. It's certainly not going to wildly change our approach to -- to the market or our strategy.
 -- 
That's great color. I appreciate it. I'll turn it over. Thank you.
Our next question comes from the line of Ben Pham with BMO.
 -- 
Hi. Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to continue to the topic of corporate M&A versus asset acquisitions.
And I'm curious, when you think about corporate deals with Brookfield Renewable historically, or even how you think about it going forward, what do you think the main benefits for -- for you specifically on the corporate transaction, especially when you talk about maybe that the long drawn off process for courtship?
 -- 
Yeah, certainly. So -- so, Ben, it's a great question. And there's two or three things I would highlight. In particular, it's an environment where we can very much differentiate ourselves using our scale and operating capabilities.
Those corporates are essentially picking a partner to help them transition to a new business model that is going to be more sustainable and more valuable for -- for decades to come. They don't want to pick a partner who isn't very very credible without best-in-class capabilities. So, we do think it is an environment where we can do those types of deals on a bilateral basis and really be differentiated and. therefore, hopefully, target some very attractive returns on our capital. The other thing that is important to highlight is, not dissimilar to -- to what we've seen in other, call it, power transformation or business transformation opportunities, is -- there is an underappreciated benefit in some of those deals that those are often large and leading corporates in many of their -- the markets that they operate in. And as a result, there's often some very attractive embedded infrastructure within those businesses that we can utilize to make the invested capital in renewables build-out or other transition initiatives, either more de-risked or done at higher returns. Because these businesses are often leading and have been built up over years and decades, the underlying infrastructure is sometimes an underappreciated benefit of some of those transactions.
 -- 
Interesting. Maybe my second and -- and last one, the distribution, 5%, quite solid in this environment. And I don't make it seem like this -- this question around this is not -- it wasn't strong, but I'm curious more, that 5%, how do you -- how do we think about that relative your -- your 10% growth rate plus and then your guidance is 5% to 9%? How do you -- how do you reconcile that?
 -- 
Absolutely. So, we remain very committed to our -- our -- increasing our distribution within that -- that 5% to 9% annual increase range that -- that we -- we have had in the market for -- for years now. And our decision around where we set within that range is always dictated by where can we drive the best returns for our capital. And because we are simply seeing so much growth and have seen so much growth in our industry and in our sector and, quite frankly, within our company specifically, both our organic pipeline and our M&A pipeline, we have been at the low end of that range. And that's simply because we are seeing such attractive opportunities to -- to deploy that capital very aggressively into growth.
Obviously, we're a long way away from making those decisions for -- for years to come, but that -- that trend has been quite consistent for a number of years now and, no doubt, played a big role in where we set the distribution increase this year.
 -- 
OK, understood. Thank you.
Our next question comes from the line of Joe Nussbaum with BNP Paribas.
 -- 
Hi, you have Moses on from BNP. How do -- how do you think about contracted versus spot power price going forward as the percent moves into the 80% and 70s? Would you see decreases or increases in realized price and -- and how do hedges play a role?
 -- 
Yeah, certainly. So -- so, our businesses outside of some of the hydro facilities we own in north -- in essentially the United States and Colombia is essentially a 100% contracted business. And we continue to believe that the risk-adjusted returns you can get by fully contracting out our wind and solar pipelines, all of our new development, the attractive financing you can get against those -- those contracts and the stability it provides to our growth and our earnings is the most attractive thing we can do. And therefore, we remain committed to not building on spec, only building when we've secured that -- that long-term contracted revenue offtake.
But to your question, you know, our contract profile, I would say almost always looks the way that it does today, a little bit higher in the near term and then kind of fading down, call it, 10 percentage points over the next five years. And what that is, is largely just our hydro portfolio that does have some modest component of merchant. We do that to protect against the variability of the resource. And very simply, some of those contracts are rolling off over the next two or three years.
But we would simply look to recontact them at that point. And I would say, you know, being at essentially 90% contracted for the current year and kind of tailing off 10 percentage points from there over a five-year forecast. I would say that profile is largely going to stay the same and just keep rolling forward as time passes. If anything, it might go a little bit up because the power price environment today is far more constructive than it's been over the last three to five years. So, we might enter into more long-term contracts on that hydro portfolio, but otherwise, I would say -- say that that profile is largely going to stay the same even as time passes and rolls forward.
 -- 
Got it. OK, that -- that makes a lot of sense. And I guess just one on up-financing. You completed 500 million in 2023.
I think it was 800 million was the most recent expectation. Is this due to the LTA performance -- performance versus LTA? Or how should we think about this for 2024? Or is it just lumpy?
 -- 
Perhaps I'll start, and then maybe, Wyatt, you can jump in if I've missed anything. I would say it certainly wasn't anything to -- to do with LTA performance. That -- that didn't even come into the -- the -- the discussion. What we are always looking to do is use excess leverage capacity within our portfolio as a means to raise liquidity at very attractive rates that we can then reinvest into growth in a very accretive manner. And we'll look to do that on an opportunistic basis at all times going forward.
A great example of that was how we tapped the MTN market just in January, securing 30-year term debt at very attractive rates when there was an attractive opening in that market. So, I would say there is nothing specific around the timing of those up-financings. But, Wyatt, I'll hand it to you if there's anything to add.
 -- 
Yeah, Moses, look, the financing environment for the majority of where we're looking to do those up financings, are on our hydro assets. The financing environment continues to be robust and is probably even more robust as rates have normalized. And so, really this was just a factor of timing and planning around our -- our funding needs, what have you. That -- that capacity that we had previously mentioned, that additional 300 million, continues to be there. And it was just around us managing our sources and uses based on our growth pipeline, what have you.
So, it was really just a factor of timing. And as I mentioned, the -- the -- the capacity is there. And in fact, the -- the -- the environment has gone better than -- than we would have made the -- that -- that estimate around $800 million.
 -- 
Very helpful. Thanks again.
That's all the time we have for Q&A today. I'd like to turn the call back to Connor Teskey for closing remarks.
 -- 
Thank you, everyone, for -- for joining this quarter's call. We appreciate your interest and support of Brookfield Renewable, and we look forward to updating you with our Q1 results in a couple of months. Thank you and have a great day. Cheers.

UPDATE 2-Australia's Origin Energy half-year profit tops forecasts on higher power prices

*
H1 underlying profit beats consensus
*
Origin raises energy markets full year guidance by 13%
*
Interim dividend, up 67%, tops forecasts
*
Shares jump 3.9%
(Recasts throughout to add more details on result, context and share price)
By Lewis Jackson and Archishma Iyer
Feb 15 (Reuters) - Australia's Origin Energy on Thursday posted a 17-fold jump in underlying profit, raised its full year outlook and announced a bigger-than-expected dividend in its first result since its top shareholder blocked a $10.6 billion takeover.
The buoyant results go some way to validating the opposition of AustralianSuper to last year's A$9.39 per share bid led by Brookfield, which Australia's largest pension fund argued was too cheap.
"We expect Origin's strong first half performance to carry over into the second half," CEO Frank Calabria said in a statement.
"I am confident in Origin's prospects and believe we are uniquely positioned to capture value from the energy transition."
The country's top power retailer reported underlying profit of A$747 million ($485 million) for the six months ended Dec. 31, compared with A$44 million a year ago and well ahead of the consensus estimate of A$688 million cited by UBS.
Its shares jumped 3.9% in early trade and were last up 2.7% at A$8.81, outperforming a 0.8% rise in the broader market .
While all segments grew, the result was driven by a resurgence in energy markets, which includes power generation and energy retailing.
Underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) there grew almost fivefold to A$1.04 billion from A$231 million a year earlier on higher electricity prices and lower fuel costs at its coal plants.
Origin raised full year guidance for the division to between A$1.6 billion ($1.04 billion) and A$1.8 billion, versus its prior forecast of between A$1.30 billion and A$1.70 billion.
In the gas business, which includes a 27.5% stake in the Australia Pacific Liquefied Natural Gas (APLNG) project, underlying EBITDA also rose 5%.
Origin, which recently raised its stake in UK energy retailer Octopus Energy to 23%, expects the business to contribute less than A$100 million in EBITDA for the full year.
Origin declared an interim dividend of 27.5 Australian cents per share, up from 16.5 Australian cents last year and ahead of the consensus 20 Australian cents per share cited by UBS.

UPDATE 2-Australia's Origin Energy picks insider Lucas as CFO amid shift to renewables

(Rewrites and updates throughout with further details and background; adds analyst reaction)
By Himanshi Akhand and Rishav Chatterjee
April 11 (Reuters) - Origin Energy picked insider Tony Lucas as its new finance chief on Thursday as the Australian electricity retailer focuses on its transition towards greener forms of energy.
Currently the executive general manager of Origin's future energy and technology division, Lucas will take charge from July 1 after Lawrie Tremaine leaves the chief financial officer (CFO) role on June 30.
"The announcement underlines the company's commitment to internal growth and progression, but it also points to potential strategic shifts, especially its future energy trajectory – an area where Lucas has significant expertise," said Josh Gilbert, a market analyst at eToro.
In December last year, Origin shareholders rejected a $10.6 billion takeover offer by a Brookfield-led consortium, and analysts have speculated that the Canadian asset manager may come up with another proposal.
"A new CFO with a focus on future energy could pave the way to a more successful deal, given Brookfield's strong focus on renewable solutions," said Gilbert.
Power retailer Origin in February said Tremaine intended to retire at the end of July.
"Tremaine will retire from the chief financial officer role on 30 June 2024, but will remain with Origin until the end of July to enable a smooth transition," the company said on Thursday.
This week's appointment marks the end of Tremaine's seven-year run at the helm, during which the electricity and gas retailer experienced some turbulence in markets, said Gilbert.
"Ultimately, he leaves the company with a much stronger share price than when his leadership was first announced," said Gilbert.
Lucas has more than 30 years of experience across finance, strategy and regulatory policy and advocacy, among others, and has been part of Origin's executive leadership team since 2016.

 on Jan. 30 said it received the last two major federal approvals needed to kick off construction of its 2.6-GW Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) project from the 
. BOEM provided its final approval of CVOW’s Construction and Operations Plan (COP), which green lights construction of the massive project’s 176 turbines and three offshore substations 24 nautical miles off Virginia’s coastline. The project directly supports the goals of a 2020 law passed by the Virginia General Assembly, the Virginia Clean Economy Act, which envisions up to 3 GW of offshore wind power by 2028. 
 The 
, an association of 40 European transmission system operators (TSOs) in 36 countries, on Jan. 24 released its first Offshore Network Development Plans (ONDPs), a significant effort that highlights the financial and technical needs for grids to be developed and upgraded to accommodate additional new generation capacity from European offshore territories. The European Council anticipates the integration of 300 GW of offshore wind generation capacity into the energy system by 2050. According to ENTSO-E, “The magnitude of this transition will raise new challenges for the European electricity system: accomplishing the necessary connections and grid development at least cost; keeping the system secure; accommodating a complete redefinition of power flow patterns; considering key constraints linked to spatial planning, environmental protection, and public acceptance; achieving an integrated perspective over time, space, and sectors; ensuring flexible resources to keep the power system balanced.” TSOs, it notes, are responsible for selecting the most appropriate connection point to shore, considering potential onshore congestion, expected future generators’ connections, and necessary network development or reinforcements. The ONDPs, which are part of ENTSO-E’s Ten-Year Network Development Plan (TYNDP) for 2024, highlight that the development of the offshore network infrastructure “should take place in synergy with the protection of the marine environment in order to achieve a sustainable energy system coexisting with biodiversity.” The ONDPs are designed to ensure that offshore systems remain at the “center of energy planning.” 
 Sizewell C, a 3.2-GW EPR nuclear plant that is under development in Suffolk, UK, on Jan. 15, secured a Development Consent Order (DCO) from the UK government, opening the path for formal construction. While the UK government granted project stakeholders permission to build in July 2022 and preparatory works have begun, the project needed to satisfy many obligations before construction could commence under its DCO. The DCO activates a£250 million package for local communities. In November 2022, the UK government said it intends to become a 50% partner with 
, a company owned by the French government. In September 2023, the UK government, Sizewell C, and EDF launched an equity raise process to attract private investors into the project. “While triggering the DCO and entering the construction phase is not dependent on a final investment decision (FID), constructive discussions with qualified potential investors are continuing, and a final investment decision is expected later in 2024,” the project website notes. In January, the UK government announced£1.3 billion ($1.7 billion) of additional investment in Sizewell C. So far, the UK has committed£1.2 billion of investment to support Sizewell C’s development, which began in 2012. The UK government’s Civil Nuclear Roadmap, launched in January 2024, suggests that the UK will make a FID on the power plant by the end of the current Parliament (which culminates in December 2024). If approved, Sizewell C could begin operations in the mid-2030s. 
 Australian integrated energy company 
 has approved the construction of a 
 lithium-ion large-scale battery at the Mortlake Power Station, a 566-MW open-cycle gas-fired power station in Victoria. The AU$400 million Mortlake Power Station battery, expected to be commissioned in late 2026, will have a capacity of 300 MW and is expected to deliver an output of up to 650 MWh. Origin said the facility will help the Mortlake peaking power plant “firm variable renewables supply and maintain reliable power for customers.” The peaking power station is powered by gas from the Otway Basin. The project has been awarded conditional grant support from the 
 as part of its Large-Scale Battery Storage Funding Round. “Origin’s strategy is to accelerate renewable energy and storage in our portfolio, and we expect large-scale batteries and other storage technologies to play a vital role in Australia’s energy transition,” Origin CEO Frank Calabria said on Jan. 29. The announcement follows Origin’s decision in April 2023 to approve its first large-scale battery at Eraring, which is currently under construction. The AU$600 million Eraring project involves the construction of a 460-MW lithium-ion battery storage system with a dispatch duration of two hours, anticipated to come online in the final quarter of the 2025 calendar year. The latter stages of the battery will have a potential peak generation output of 700 MW for up to four hours, or lesser loads for longer periods (such as 200 MW over 14 hours). 
 Global engineering giant 
 will support 
 molten salt microreactor concept, which uses long-lived nuclear waste. The French start-up’s concept, XAMR, is a fast reactor that operates at close to atmospheric pressure and is salt-cooled, “in which an inherently auto-regulated fission reaction takes place at a high temperature (around 700C),” the company says on its website. “The inherent dynamic of molten salt reactors is more favorable from a safety point of view than that of a solid fuel reactor,” it says. NAAREA was one of the first companies to receive funding support from the France 2030 investment plan, a government initiative that seeks to reinvigorate the country’s nuclear industry. NAAREA says it is developing a production facility that could produce the first microreactors by 2027 and increase production gradually over five years. “NAAREA’s microreactors are also designed to be installed close to consumers to best meet their needs, thus enabling the decentralization of energy production,” it notes. Jacobs is expected to assist NAAREA with nuclear safety as well as several engineering disciplines, including control and instrumentation, mechanical, and process.

NSW government to extend life of Origin’s Eraring coal plant to 2027

The government of New South Wales (NSW) in Australia has reached an agreement with Origin Energy to extend the operation of the 2.92GW Eraring coal-fired power station until at least August 2027.
This extension, which could cost up to A$225m ($149.5m) annually, is aimed at ensuring the security of the state's electricity supply during the energy transition.
Origin Energy has committed to producing a minimum of 6 terawatt hours of power annually from the Eraring plant at Lake Macquarie.
This represents 3% of the total generation in the eastern states' national electricity market.
The Australian energy market operator's analysis, cited by the government, indicates that without Eraring, NSW would face energy reliability risks starting in 2025.
The agreement is designed to be temporary and targeted, providing a buffer period to develop the necessary renewable energy, storage and network infrastructure to replace the power station.
The government has clarified that there will be no upfront payments made to Origin for operating Eraring.
Instead, an underwriting arrangement has been established in which Origin will pay the government one-fifth of the operating profits, up to a maximum of A$40m ($26.6m) per year, if the plant is profitable during the extension period.
If the plant operates at a loss, Origin may claim subsidies for the plant's operating and capital expenses, with a cap of A$225m annually.
Origin has the option to continue running the plant until 2029, but the state will not offer any compensation beyond August 2027.
The plant’s extension aligns with Origin's 2030 emissions reduction targets and its goal to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, as detailed in its Climate Transition Action Plan.
Origin Energy CEO Frank Calabria stated: “We believe this agreement strikes the right balance, with an extension to operations enabling Eraring to continue supporting the security of electricity supply in New South Wales through the energy transition, while making compensation available to Origin in the event economic conditions for the plant are challenging.
“This agreement supports Eraring to continue to play an important role in maintaining reliable power for businesses and households through a period in which there remains considerable uncertainty about the volume and timing of new renewables, transmission and firming infrastructure coming online.”
Climate Change, Energy and the Environment Minister Penny Sharpe said: “New South Wales is stepping up the transition to cheap, clean, reliable renewable energy.
“But to keep the lights on and prices down, we need to make sure new renewable infrastructure and storage capacity is online before coal-fired generators reach the end of their life.”
