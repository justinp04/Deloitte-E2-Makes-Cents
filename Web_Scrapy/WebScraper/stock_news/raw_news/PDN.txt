Paladin Energy Ltd (ASX:PDN) Shares Could Be 50% Below Their Intrinsic Value Estimate 2024-01-11T20:16:08.000Z

Does the January share price for Paladin Energy Ltd (ASX:PDN) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!
We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the 
 may be something of interest to you.
We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:
 = US$1.5b
We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.6%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$357m× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.6%– 2.1%) = US$6.6b
= TV / (1 + r)
= US$6.6b÷ ( 1 + 7.6%)
= US$3.2b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$4.7b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of AU$1.2, the company appears quite good value at a 50% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.
Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Paladin Energy as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.097. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Paladin Energy, we've put together three fundamental items you should look at:
PS. Simply Wall St updates its DCF calculation for every Australian stock every day, so if you want to find the intrinsic value of any other stock just

Both retail investors who control a good portion of Paladin Energy Ltd (ASX:PDN) along with institutions must be dismayed after last week's 9.3% decrease 2024-02-22T23:26:06.000Z

Every investor in Paladin Energy Ltd (
) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 48% stake, retail investors possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
While institutions, who own 47% shares weren’t spared from last week’s AU$358m market cap drop, retail investors as a group suffered the maximum losses
Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Paladin Energy.
Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.
We can see that Paladin Energy does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Paladin Energy, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.
Paladin Energy is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is Mirae Asset Global Investments Co., Ltd., with ownership of 6.1%. Paradice Investment Management Pty Ltd. is the second largest shareholder owning 5.9% of common stock, and ALPS Advisors, Inc. holds about 5.5% of the company stock.
Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.
While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.
Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.
Our information suggests that Paladin Energy Ltd insiders own under 1% of the company. But they may have an indirect interest through a corporate structure that we haven't picked up on. It is a pretty big company, so it would be possible for board members to own a meaningful interest in the company, without owning much of a proportional interest. In this case, they own around AU$20m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking 
With a 48% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Paladin Energy. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.
It seems that Private Companies own 3.4%, of the Paladin Energy stock. Private companies may be related parties. Sometimes insiders have an interest in a public company through a holding in a private company, rather than in their own capacity as an individual. While it's hard to draw any broad stroke conclusions, it is worth noting as an area for further research.
It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Paladin Energy better, we need to consider many other factors. Be aware that 
, you should know about...
But ultimately 
, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at

Are You Looking for a Top Momentum Pick? Why Paladin Energy (PALAF) is a Great Choice 2024-03-26T16:00:07.000Z

Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be "buying high, but hoping to sell even higher." And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.
Below, we take a look at 
, a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.
It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Paladin Energy currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.
You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>
In order to see if PALAF is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this uranium mining company holds up.
Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.
For PALAF, shares are up 14.49% over the past week while the Zacks Mining - Miscellaneous industry is flat over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 21.33% compares favorably with the industry's 6.19% performance as well.
While any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Over the past quarter, shares of Paladin Energy have risen 37.88%, and are up 145.95% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 10.11% and 33.15%, respectively.
Investors should also pay attention to PALAF's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. PALAF is currently averaging 810,219 shares for the last 20 days.
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with PALAF.
Over the past two months, 1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost PALAF's consensus estimate, increasing from -$0.02 to $0.01 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.
Taking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that PALAF is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Paladin Energy on your short list.

Australia's Paladin Energy to buy Canada's Fission Uranium for $833 million 2024-06-24T06:59:50.000Z

(Reuters) -Australian miner Paladin Energy said on Monday it had entered into an agreement to buy Canada's Fission Uranium Corp for an implied equity value of C$1.14 billion ($833.03 million).
The deal comes at a time when prices for uranium, used to fuel most of the world's nuclear reactors supplying 16% of the global energy, has increased significantly last year due to rising demand and limited supply.
Under the offer, Fission shareholders will receive 0.1076 shares of Paladin for every Fission share held, the company said, adding the deal implies a value of C$1.30 per share for the Canadian miner, a 25.8% premium to its closing price of C$1.03 on Friday.
Paladin has applied for listing its stock on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), where Fission shareholders will own 24% Paladin shares, the company said.
Fission's board has recommended shareholders' vote in favour of the transaction, Paladin added.
"This arrangement significantly de-risks the mine-building financing at Patterson Lake South projects (PLS), with the cash flow generation at Langer Heinrich and a strong balance sheet creating an opportunity to significantly fund the development of PLS," Fission President and CEO Ross McElroy said.

Australia's Paladin Energy to Acquire Fission Uranium in $1.14 Billion Deal
================================================================================

Paladin Energy to acquire Fission Uranium for C$1.14bn 2024-06-24T15:26:14.000Z

Paladin Energy has announced a definitive agreement to acquire Fission Uranium for C$1.14bn (A$1.25bn), or C$1.30 a share.
This move will establish the company as a global uranium leader with assets spanning Canada, Namibia and Australia.
The acquisition is structured as a 100% share takeover under the Canada Business Corporation Act, subject to court approval and a plan of arrangement.
As per the agreed terms, each Fission share will be exchanged for a 0.1076 share of Paladin.
The offer marks a 25.8% premium to Fission’s stock close on 21 June and a 30% premium to the 20-day volume weighted average price.
Fission's directors and senior management, who hold 0.7% of Fission shares, have agreed to support the transaction, committing to vote in favour at the upcoming special shareholders' meeting.
The transaction is expected to be finalised in the September 2024 quarter, pending fulfilment of all conditions outlined in the agreement.
Upon completion, Paladin and Fission shareholders will hold approximately 76% and 24% of the enlarged Paladin entity, respectively.
Following the transaction's closure, Fission shares will be de-listed from the Toronto Stock Exchange, the OTCQX, and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, consolidating the company's market presence under the Paladin brand.
Paladin CEO Ian Purdy said: “The acquisition of Fission, along with the successful restart of our Langer Heinrich Mine, is another step in our strategy to diversify and grow into a global uranium leader across the top uranium mining jurisdictions of Canada, Namibia and Australia.
“Fission is a natural fit for our portfolio with the shallow high-grade PLS project located in Canada’s Athabasca Basin. The addition of PLS creates a leading Canadian development hub alongside Paladin’s Michelin project, with exploration upside across all Canadian properties.
“Both sets of shareholders are expected to benefit from the increased scale of the enlarged company, with a combined mineral resource representing one of the largest amongst pure-play uranium companies globally and a substantially increased international capital markets exposure.”

Fission Uranium (FCUUF) Agrees to be Acquired by Paladin Energy 2024-06-25T14:22:00.000Z

Shares of 
 FCUUF gained 15% on the announcement that it inked a deal with the Australian miner, Paladin Energy Limited, per which the latter will acquire its outstanding shares for an implied total equity value of C$1.14 billion ($833 million).
The combined company will have a pro-forma market capitalization of $3.5 billion. It will be placed among the largest pure-play global uranium companies with a combined mineral resource of 544 million pounds of uranium and ore reserves of 157 million. It will have a solid portfolio of exploration, development and production assets, and a substantially increased international capital markets exposure.
Fission Uranium’s shareholders will receive 0.1076 fully paid shares of Paladin for each share held in FCUUF. The transaction is expected to close in the September 2024 quarter, subject to the satisfaction of all conditions under the agreement. On completion, existing Paladin and Fission shareholders will own around 76% and 24% of the combined entity, respectively.
Paladin has applied for listing of its shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange, concurrent with the completion of the transaction. Consequently, Fission Uranium shareholders will receive TSX-listed Paladin Shares.
Paladin Energy is an independent uranium producer with 75% ownership of the world-class long-life Langer Heinrich Mine located in Namibia. Paladin also owns a portfolio of uranium exploration and development assets in Canada and Australia.  Through its Langer Heinrich Mine, Paladin delivers uranium to major nuclear utilities across the world. It has a 17-year estimated mine life and a nameplate annual capacity of 6 million pounds of uranium.
The acquisition of Fission Uranium will make Paladin the 100% owner of the Patterson Lake South uranium property. It is a proposed high-grade uranium mine and mill in Canada’s Athabasca Basin region. The feasibility study for the property projects a 10-year mine life with an annual production of 9.1 million pounds of uranium.
This move will help Paladin capitalize on the growing demand for uranium. Several factors are driving this demand, such as the need for more electricity generation and the global push to decarbonize electrical grids, among others.
 
Over the past few years, the global uranium market has undergone a shift from inventory-driven to a production-driven market.  Underinvestment in uranium mining operations over the past decade has been the reason for a structural deficit between global production and uranium requirements.  In 2024 and 2025, the gap between production and demand is projected to be more than 66 million pounds of uranium and is expected to reach more than 400 million pounds by 2034. Uranium prices will be supported by robust demand and tight supply.
Shares of Fission Uranium have surged 93.9% in the past year compared with the industry's 36.4% growth.
Fission Uranium currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
Some better-ranked stocks from the basic materials space are

Paladin Energy Aims to Crack Uranium Big League With Canadian Takeover 2024-07-17T21:09:58.000Z

(Bloomberg) -- Paladin Energy Ltd.’s top boss says its takeover of Fission Uranium Corp. would make it the third-largest publicly traded uranium producer, offering investors an alternative in a sector dominated by two giants.
Most Read from Bloomberg
Paladin would churn out 10% of global uranium output after combining production of its Namibian mine with Fission’s Canadian project when completed, Chief Executive Officer Ian Purdy said in a Wednesday interview in Toronto. That would lift Paladin’s ranking by output to third, behind top producer Kazatomprom, which is controlled by the government of Kazakhstan, and Canada’s Cameco Corp.
“We think there’s a fantastic opportunity to provide a really substantial global alternative to Cameco with this deal,” said Purdy, who visited Canada this week to meet federal government officials about the proposal.
Combining companies would make it easier to attract investors and raise the likelihood that Fission’s Patterson Lake South project is completed by the end of the decade, Purdy said. He expects to fund construction of Fission’s C$1.2 billion ($877 million) project by cash generated from Paladin’s Langer Heinrich operation in Namibia as well as through traditional financing, including debt and offtake agreements.
Paladin’s agreement last month to buy Fission in a C$1.14 billion all-stock deal marks the first significant sign of consolidation in a sector that has been revived by global demand for nuclear energy. While uranium prices have rallied as supply concerns escalate and countries reconsider nuclear power as a way to cut carbon emissions, just a handful of companies offer investors exposure to the nuclear reactor fuel.
The CEO estimates that Perth, Australia-based company will increase its market value after acquiring Fission, giving the combined company greater financial heft to pursue its objectives.
“We’ve got strong relationships in the debt market and obviously, being a $5 billion company, we’ll be able to attract different forms of finance that Fission wouldn’t have been able to attract as an independent, small company,” Purdy said.
Paladin’s deal requires approval from Canada’s federal government, which has increased scrutiny on critical minerals deals involving foreign buyers. Purdy said he received a positive response from government officials Tuesday when he visited Ottawa to discuss the proposal. The company expects the takeover to close in September.

3 Uranium Stocks to Bet On for Market-Crushing Returns 2024-07-22T18:25:05.000Z

The uranium spot price has dropped by approximately 18% since January, below the 
. As such, numerous uranium stocks have shed weight, concurrently casting doubt over the industry.
Falling uranium prices are a severe headwind. However, as a contrarian, I believe uranium’s recent decline has sparked a buying opportunity, especially given the ongoing worldwide energy shortage. Thus, I embarked on a journey to find three best-in-class uranium stocks to buy. My screening process focused on fundamental aspects, valuation multiples and technical analysis. Moreover, risk assessment was phased in where necessary to ensure complete alignment.
Considering the above, here are three top-tier uranium stocks to watch.

Moreover, Cameco is known as the world’s largest uranium producer, meaning its market share allows for preferential treatment and economies of scale.
Cameco released its first-quarter financial results in April, revealing a revenue miss of 
 and an earnings-per-share miss of 16 cents. However, the event didn’t deter CCJ stock, as it has traded flat ever since. Although Cameco’s earnings defeat was an adverse event, many investors, including myself, remain optimistic about the company’s outlook because numerous catalysts have emerged. For example, synergies related to the firm’s recent acquisition of Westinghouse could soon be realized, adding significant operating advantages. In addition, Cameco might be assisted with a uranium price rebound in late 2024 amid an

Although a risky bet, CCJ stock looks destined to win!

 (NYSE:
) is an underestimated uranium producer; it’s as simple as that. The company is one of the largest resource and landholders in Canada’s Athabasca Basin. Moreover, unlike Cameco, which mines a large amount of its deposits in Kazakhstan, Uranium Energy Corp is a North American pure-play, meaning it is unhinged by the current geopolitical tensions between Eastern Europe and Russia.
According to geophysical studies, Uranium Energy Corp’s Canadian projects alone contain 
 of measured and inferred deposits. Additionally, the firm has a

Although Paladin has delivered tangible results, it remains in early-stage exploration mode. For instance, the firm is developing numerous projects in North America and Australia. Moreover, Paldin recently agreed to acquire Fission Uranium for

I added Paladin Energy to the list as a diversification vehicle. Cameco and Uranium Energy Corp are established players. However, Paladin Energy is an early-stage growth stock, which could add a different dynamic to your portfolio. The firm’s aggressive capital expenditure roadmap might result in volatility, but its long-term results seem promising.
Paladin Energy’s stock has surged by approximately 
 year-over-year. As such, the question naturally becomes: Is PALAF stock overpriced? Although a pullback is possible, I deem the stock underpriced based on its growth story.

Paladin Energy Ltd's (ASX:PDN) institutional investors lost 3.1% last week but have benefitted from longer-term gains 2024-08-01T01:16:08.000Z

If you want to know who really controls Paladin Energy Ltd (
), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 63% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.
No shareholder likes losing money on their investments, especially institutional investors who saw their holdings drop 3.1% in value last week. However, the 46% one-year return to shareholders might have softened the blow. But they would probably be wary of future losses.
Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Paladin Energy, beginning with the chart below.
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
We can see that Paladin Energy does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Paladin Energy's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Paladin Energy. The company's largest shareholder is State Street Global Advisors, Inc., with ownership of 11%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.7% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 7.5% by the third-largest shareholder.
On further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 9 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.
Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Paladin Energy Ltd in their own names. We do note, however, it is possible insiders have an indirect interest through a private company or other corporate structure. Keep in mind that it's a big company, and the insiders own AU$19m worth of shares. The absolute value might be more important than the proportional share. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking 
The general public-- including retail investors -- own 33% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.
It seems that Private Companies own 3.4%, of the Paladin Energy stock. It might be worth looking deeper into this. If related parties, such as insiders, have an interest in one of these private companies, that should be disclosed in the annual report. Private companies may also have a strategic interest in the company.
It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Paladin Energy better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 
 you should know about.
But ultimately 
, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at 
.

Paladin Energy Ltd (ASX:PDN) Shares Could Be 50% Below Their Intrinsic Value Estimate 2024-01-11T20:16:08.000Z

Does the January share price for Paladin Energy Ltd (ASX:PDN) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!
We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the 
 may be something of interest to you.
We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:
 = US$1.5b
We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.6%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$357m× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.6%– 2.1%) = US$6.6b
= TV / (1 + r)
= US$6.6b÷ ( 1 + 7.6%)
= US$3.2b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$4.7b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of AU$1.2, the company appears quite good value at a 50% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.
Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Paladin Energy as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.097. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Paladin Energy, we've put together three fundamental items you should look at:

Both retail investors who control a good portion of Paladin Energy Ltd (ASX:PDN) along with institutions must be dismayed after last week's 9.3% decrease 2024-02-22T23:26:06.000Z

Every investor in Paladin Energy Ltd (
) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 48% stake, retail investors possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
While institutions, who own 47% shares weren’t spared from last week’s AU$358m market cap drop, retail investors as a group suffered the maximum losses
Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Paladin Energy.
Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.
We can see that Paladin Energy does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Paladin Energy, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.
Paladin Energy is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is Mirae Asset Global Investments Co., Ltd., with ownership of 6.1%. Paradice Investment Management Pty Ltd. is the second largest shareholder owning 5.9% of common stock, and ALPS Advisors, Inc. holds about 5.5% of the company stock.
Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.
While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.
Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.
Our information suggests that Paladin Energy Ltd insiders own under 1% of the company. But they may have an indirect interest through a corporate structure that we haven't picked up on. It is a pretty big company, so it would be possible for board members to own a meaningful interest in the company, without owning much of a proportional interest. In this case, they own around AU$20m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking 
With a 48% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Paladin Energy. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.
It seems that Private Companies own 3.4%, of the Paladin Energy stock. Private companies may be related parties. Sometimes insiders have an interest in a public company through a holding in a private company, rather than in their own capacity as an individual. While it's hard to draw any broad stroke conclusions, it is worth noting as an area for further research.
It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Paladin Energy better, we need to consider many other factors. Be aware that 
, you should know about...
But ultimately 
, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at

Are You Looking for a Top Momentum Pick? Why Paladin Energy (PALAF) is a Great Choice 2024-03-26T16:00:07.000Z

Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be "buying high, but hoping to sell even higher." And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.
Below, we take a look at 
, a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.
It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Paladin Energy currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.
You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>
In order to see if PALAF is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this uranium mining company holds up.
Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.
For PALAF, shares are up 14.49% over the past week while the Zacks Mining - Miscellaneous industry is flat over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 21.33% compares favorably with the industry's 6.19% performance as well.
While any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Over the past quarter, shares of Paladin Energy have risen 37.88%, and are up 145.95% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 10.11% and 33.15%, respectively.
Investors should also pay attention to PALAF's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. PALAF is currently averaging 810,219 shares for the last 20 days.
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with PALAF.
Over the past two months, 1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost PALAF's consensus estimate, increasing from -$0.02 to $0.01 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.
Taking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that PALAF is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Paladin Energy on your short list.

Australia's Paladin Energy to buy Canada's Fission Uranium for $833 million 2024-06-24T06:59:50.000Z

(Reuters) -Australian miner Paladin Energy said on Monday it had entered into an agreement to buy Canada's Fission Uranium Corp for an implied equity value of C$1.14 billion ($833.03 million).
The deal comes at a time when prices for uranium, used to fuel most of the world's nuclear reactors supplying 16% of the global energy, has increased significantly last year due to rising demand and limited supply.
Under the offer, Fission shareholders will receive 0.1076 shares of Paladin for every Fission share held, the company said, adding the deal implies a value of C$1.30 per share for the Canadian miner, a 25.8% premium to its closing price of C$1.03 on Friday.
Paladin has applied for listing its stock on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), where Fission shareholders will own 24% Paladin shares, the company said.
Fission's board has recommended shareholders' vote in favour of the transaction, Paladin added.
"This arrangement significantly de-risks the mine-building financing at Patterson Lake South projects (PLS), with the cash flow generation at Langer Heinrich and a strong balance sheet creating an opportunity to significantly fund the development of PLS," Fission President and CEO Ross McElroy said.

Australia's Paladin Energy to Acquire Fission Uranium in $1.14 Billion Deal 2024-06-24T10:59:32.000Z

Australia's Paladin Energy to Acquire Fission Uranium in $1.14 Billion Deal
================================================================================

Paladin Energy to acquire Fission Uranium for C$1.14bn 2024-06-24T15:26:14.000Z

Paladin Energy has announced a definitive agreement to acquire Fission Uranium for C$1.14bn (A$1.25bn), or C$1.30 a share.
This move will establish the company as a global uranium leader with assets spanning Canada, Namibia and Australia.
The acquisition is structured as a 100% share takeover under the Canada Business Corporation Act, subject to court approval and a plan of arrangement.
As per the agreed terms, each Fission share will be exchanged for a 0.1076 share of Paladin.
The offer marks a 25.8% premium to Fission’s stock close on 21 June and a 30% premium to the 20-day volume weighted average price.
Fission's directors and senior management, who hold 0.7% of Fission shares, have agreed to support the transaction, committing to vote in favour at the upcoming special shareholders' meeting.
The transaction is expected to be finalised in the September 2024 quarter, pending fulfilment of all conditions outlined in the agreement.
Upon completion, Paladin and Fission shareholders will hold approximately 76% and 24% of the enlarged Paladin entity, respectively.
Following the transaction's closure, Fission shares will be de-listed from the Toronto Stock Exchange, the OTCQX, and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, consolidating the company's market presence under the Paladin brand.
Paladin CEO Ian Purdy said: “The acquisition of Fission, along with the successful restart of our Langer Heinrich Mine, is another step in our strategy to diversify and grow into a global uranium leader across the top uranium mining jurisdictions of Canada, Namibia and Australia.
“Fission is a natural fit for our portfolio with the shallow high-grade PLS project located in Canada’s Athabasca Basin. The addition of PLS creates a leading Canadian development hub alongside Paladin’s Michelin project, with exploration upside across all Canadian properties.
“Both sets of shareholders are expected to benefit from the increased scale of the enlarged company, with a combined mineral resource representing one of the largest amongst pure-play uranium companies globally and a substantially increased international capital markets exposure.”

Fission Uranium (FCUUF) Agrees to be Acquired by Paladin Energy 2024-06-25T14:22:00.000Z

Shares of 
 FCUUF gained 15% on the announcement that it inked a deal with the Australian miner, Paladin Energy Limited, per which the latter will acquire its outstanding shares for an implied total equity value of C$1.14 billion ($833 million).
The combined company will have a pro-forma market capitalization of $3.5 billion. It will be placed among the largest pure-play global uranium companies with a combined mineral resource of 544 million pounds of uranium and ore reserves of 157 million. It will have a solid portfolio of exploration, development and production assets, and a substantially increased international capital markets exposure.
Fission Uranium’s shareholders will receive 0.1076 fully paid shares of Paladin for each share held in FCUUF. The transaction is expected to close in the September 2024 quarter, subject to the satisfaction of all conditions under the agreement. On completion, existing Paladin and Fission shareholders will own around 76% and 24% of the combined entity, respectively.
Paladin has applied for listing of its shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange, concurrent with the completion of the transaction. Consequently, Fission Uranium shareholders will receive TSX-listed Paladin Shares.
Paladin Energy is an independent uranium producer with 75% ownership of the world-class long-life Langer Heinrich Mine located in Namibia. Paladin also owns a portfolio of uranium exploration and development assets in Canada and Australia.  Through its Langer Heinrich Mine, Paladin delivers uranium to major nuclear utilities across the world. It has a 17-year estimated mine life and a nameplate annual capacity of 6 million pounds of uranium.
The acquisition of Fission Uranium will make Paladin the 100% owner of the Patterson Lake South uranium property. It is a proposed high-grade uranium mine and mill in Canada’s Athabasca Basin region. The feasibility study for the property projects a 10-year mine life with an annual production of 9.1 million pounds of uranium.
This move will help Paladin capitalize on the growing demand for uranium. Several factors are driving this demand, such as the need for more electricity generation and the global push to decarbonize electrical grids, among others.
 
Over the past few years, the global uranium market has undergone a shift from inventory-driven to a production-driven market.  Underinvestment in uranium mining operations over the past decade has been the reason for a structural deficit between global production and uranium requirements.  In 2024 and 2025, the gap between production and demand is projected to be more than 66 million pounds of uranium and is expected to reach more than 400 million pounds by 2034. Uranium prices will be supported by robust demand and tight supply.
Shares of Fission Uranium have surged 93.9% in the past year compared with the industry's 36.4% growth.
Fission Uranium currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Paladin Energy Aims to Crack Uranium Big League With Canadian Takeover 2024-07-17T21:09:58.000Z

(Bloomberg) -- Paladin Energy Ltd.’s top boss says its takeover of Fission Uranium Corp. would make it the third-largest publicly traded uranium producer, offering investors an alternative in a sector dominated by two giants.
Most Read from Bloomberg
Paladin would churn out 10% of global uranium output after combining production of its Namibian mine with Fission’s Canadian project when completed, Chief Executive Officer Ian Purdy said in a Wednesday interview in Toronto. That would lift Paladin’s ranking by output to third, behind top producer Kazatomprom, which is controlled by the government of Kazakhstan, and Canada’s Cameco Corp.
“We think there’s a fantastic opportunity to provide a really substantial global alternative to Cameco with this deal,” said Purdy, who visited Canada this week to meet federal government officials about the proposal.
Combining companies would make it easier to attract investors and raise the likelihood that Fission’s Patterson Lake South project is completed by the end of the decade, Purdy said. He expects to fund construction of Fission’s C$1.2 billion ($877 million) project by cash generated from Paladin’s Langer Heinrich operation in Namibia as well as through traditional financing, including debt and offtake agreements.
Paladin’s agreement last month to buy Fission in a C$1.14 billion all-stock deal marks the first significant sign of consolidation in a sector that has been revived by global demand for nuclear energy. While uranium prices have rallied as supply concerns escalate and countries reconsider nuclear power as a way to cut carbon emissions, just a handful of companies offer investors exposure to the nuclear reactor fuel.
The CEO estimates that Perth, Australia-based company will increase its market value after acquiring Fission, giving the combined company greater financial heft to pursue its objectives.
“We’ve got strong relationships in the debt market and obviously, being a $5 billion company, we’ll be able to attract different forms of finance that Fission wouldn’t have been able to attract as an independent, small company,” Purdy said.
Paladin’s deal requires approval from Canada’s federal government, which has increased scrutiny on critical minerals deals involving foreign buyers. Purdy said he received a positive response from government officials Tuesday when he visited Ottawa to discuss the proposal. The company expects the takeover to close in September.

3 Uranium Stocks to Bet On for Market-Crushing Returns 2024-07-22T18:25:05.000Z

The uranium spot price has dropped by approximately 18% since January, below the 
. As such, numerous uranium stocks have shed weight, concurrently casting doubt over the industry.
Falling uranium prices are a severe headwind. However, as a contrarian, I believe uranium’s recent decline has sparked a buying opportunity, especially given the ongoing worldwide energy shortage. Thus, I embarked on a journey to find three best-in-class uranium stocks to buy. My screening process focused on fundamental aspects, valuation multiples and technical analysis. Moreover, risk assessment was phased in where necessary to ensure complete alignment.
Considering the above, here are three top-tier uranium stocks to watch.

 (NYSE:

Moreover, Cameco is known as the world’s largest uranium producer, meaning its market share allows for preferential treatment and economies of scale.
Cameco released its first-quarter financial results in April, revealing a revenue miss of 
 and an earnings-per-share miss of 16 cents. However, the event didn’t deter CCJ stock, as it has traded flat ever since. Although Cameco’s earnings defeat was an adverse event, many investors, including myself, remain optimistic about the company’s outlook because numerous catalysts have emerged. For example, synergies related to the firm’s recent acquisition of Westinghouse could soon be realized, adding significant operating advantages. In addition, Cameco might be assisted with a uranium price rebound in late 2024 amid an

Although a risky bet, CCJ stock looks destined to win!

 (NYSE:
) is an underestimated uranium producer; it’s as simple as that. The company is one of the largest resource and landholders in Canada’s Athabasca Basin. Moreover, unlike Cameco, which mines a large amount of its deposits in Kazakhstan, Uranium Energy Corp is a North American pure-play, meaning it is unhinged by the current geopolitical tensions between Eastern Europe and Russia.
According to geophysical studies, Uranium Energy Corp’s Canadian projects alone contain 
 of measured and inferred deposits. Additionally, the firm has a 
 stake in

Although Paladin has delivered tangible results, it remains in early-stage exploration mode. For instance, the firm is developing numerous projects in North America and Australia. Moreover, Paldin recently agreed to acquire Fission Uranium for

I added Paladin Energy to the list as a diversification vehicle. Cameco and Uranium Energy Corp are established players. However, Paladin Energy is an early-stage growth stock, which could add a different dynamic to your portfolio. The firm’s aggressive capital expenditure roadmap might result in volatility, but its long-term results seem promising.
Paladin Energy’s stock has surged by approximately 
 year-over-year. As such, the question naturally becomes: Is PALAF stock overpriced? Although a pullback is possible, I deem the stock underpriced based on its growth story.

Paladin Energy Ltd's (ASX:PDN) institutional investors lost 3.1% last week but have benefitted from longer-term gains 2024-08-01T01:16:08.000Z

If you want to know who really controls Paladin Energy Ltd (
), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 63% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.
No shareholder likes losing money on their investments, especially institutional investors who saw their holdings drop 3.1% in value last week. However, the 46% one-year return to shareholders might have softened the blow. But they would probably be wary of future losses.
Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Paladin Energy, beginning with the chart below.
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
We can see that Paladin Energy does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Paladin Energy's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Paladin Energy. The company's largest shareholder is State Street Global Advisors, Inc., with ownership of 11%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.7% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 7.5% by the third-largest shareholder.
On further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 9 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.
Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Paladin Energy Ltd in their own names. We do note, however, it is possible insiders have an indirect interest through a private company or other corporate structure. Keep in mind that it's a big company, and the insiders own AU$19m worth of shares. The absolute value might be more important than the proportional share. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking 
The general public-- including retail investors -- own 33% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.
It seems that Private Companies own 3.4%, of the Paladin Energy stock. It might be worth looking deeper into this. If related parties, such as insiders, have an interest in one of these private companies, that should be disclosed in the annual report. Private companies may also have a strategic interest in the company.
It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Paladin Energy better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 
 you should know about.
But ultimately 
, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at 
.
