Does This Valuation Of REA Group Limited (ASX:REA) Imply Investors Are Overpaying?

How far off is REA Group Limited (
) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.
We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the 
.
We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:
 = AU$5.4b
We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.3%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$1.2b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.3%– 2.0%) = AU$22b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$22b÷ ( 1 + 7.3%)
= AU$11b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is AU$16b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of AU$159, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.
We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at REA Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.061. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price exceeding the intrinsic value? For REA Group, we've put together three additional factors you should further research:

REA Group Limited's (ASX:REA) top owners are public companies with 61% stake, while 28% is held by individual investors

A look at the shareholders of REA Group Limited (
) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 61% to be precise, is public companies. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).
And individual investors on the other hand have a 28% ownership in the company.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of REA Group.
Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.
We can see that REA Group does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see REA Group's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
Hedge funds don't have many shares in REA Group. The company's largest shareholder is News Corporation, with ownership of 61%. This implies that they have majority interest control of the future of the company. With 1.6% and 1.6% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and Australian Super Pty Ltd are the second and third largest shareholders.
While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.
The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.
I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.
Our information suggests that REA Group Limited insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own AU$82m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking 
The general public-- including retail investors -- own 28% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.
It appears to us that public companies own 61% of REA Group. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.
It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand REA Group better, we need to consider many other factors.

Is Now The Time To Look At Buying REA Group Limited (ASX:REA)?

REA Group Limited (
) received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the ASX over the last few months, increasing to AU$165 at one point, and dropping to the lows of AU$146. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether REA Group's current trading price of AU$153 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at REA Group’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.
According to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average, the stock currently looks expensive. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 56.84x is currently well-above the industry average of 29.24x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. In addition to this, it seems like REA Group’s share price is quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to fall back down to an attractive buying range, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.
Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 85% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for REA Group. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.
 REA’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe REA should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.
 If you’ve been keeping an eye on REA for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for REA, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

Here's What REA Group's (ASX:REA) Strong Returns On Capital Mean

Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics. One common approach is to try and find a company with 
 on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing 
 of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. That's why when we briefly looked at 
 (
) ROCE trend, we were very happy with what we saw.
If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on REA Group is:
0.24 = AU$542m ÷ (AU$2.6b - AU$361m) 
.
So, 
 That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 8.7% earned by companies in a similar industry.
In the above chart we have measured REA Group's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our 
 
.
It's hard not to be impressed by REA Group's returns on capital. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 24% and the business has deployed 60% more capital into its operations. Now considering ROCE is an attractive 24%, this combination is actually pretty appealing because it means the business can consistently put money to work and generate these high returns. If REA Group can keep this up, we'd be very optimistic about its future.
In short, we'd argue REA Group has the makings of a multi-bagger since its been able to compound its capital at very profitable rates of return. Therefore it's no surprise that shareholders have earned a respectable 98% return if they held over the last five years. So even though the stock might be more "expensive" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research.
While REA Group looks impressive, no company is worth an infinite price. The 
 helps visualize whether REA is currently trading for a fair price.

REA Group Limited's (ASX:REA) Stock Has Shown Weakness Lately But Financial Prospects Look Decent: Is The Market Wrong?

REA Group (ASX:REA) has had a rough month with its share price down 6.7%. But if you pay close attention, you might find that its key financial indicators look quite decent, which could mean that the stock could potentially rise in the long-term given how markets usually reward more resilient long-term fundamentals. Particularly, we will be paying attention to 
 ROE today.
Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.
The 
 is:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for REA Group is:
23% = AU$345m ÷ AU$1.5b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).
The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each A$1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made A$0.23 in profit.
Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or "retain", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.
Firstly, we acknowledge that REA Group has a significantly high ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 14% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. As a result, REA Group's exceptional 22% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise.
Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that REA Group's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 28% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see.
The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is REA Group fairly valued compared to other companies? These 
 might help you decide.
The high three-year median payout ratio of 59% (implying that it keeps only 41% of profits) for REA Group suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of the earnings to its shareholders.
Moreover, REA Group is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 58%. However, REA Group's ROE is predicted to rise to 30% despite there being no anticipated change in its payout ratio.
Overall, we feel that REA Group certainly does have some positive factors to consider. The company has grown its earnings moderately as previously discussed. Still, the high ROE could have been even more beneficial to investors had the company been reinvesting more of its profits. As highlighted earlier, the current reinvestment rate appears to be quite low. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

Unidentified Analyst
Welcome to News Corp's First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. Media will be allowed on a listen-only basis. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Michael Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Thank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp's Fiscal First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago, and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com. On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We'll open with some prepared remarks, and we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community. 
This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA, and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in the earnings release for the applicable periods posted on our website. 
With that, I'll pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.
Thank you, Mike. In a world replete with uncertainty, News Corp is proud to report rising revenues and increased profitability in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. These distinctly positive results come despite inauspicious macroeconomic conditions, including steep interest rates and unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations. The potential for even profitability should be even more pronounced when we return to economic equilibrium. 
These results follow the 3 most profitable years since the creation of the new News Corp and our digital transformation has continued apace. And in our view, these results certainly highlight the disparity between the value of our company and our share price, which we believe does not reflect our present profitability yet to lower the potential of our incomparable growing businesses. We are acutely focused on enhancing long-term value for all of our investors, and in that quest, have the patent advantage of prized assets whose value we believe is increasing. We are also assiduously reviewing our structure in the quest to optimize that value. 
Our first quarter revenues rose modestly to $2.5 billion, while profitability rose 4%, marking the second consecutive quarter of profit growth in these challenging conditions. We believe these positive results are a harbinger of our potential in the medium and long term. We expect to continue to drive our digital growth, the scale of which has been transformative over the past decade. It is worth noting a couple of metrics for context and to highlight the intrinsic value of our company. 
In 2014, print-related advertising accounted for 39% of our revenue, and now it is trending at less than 5%, while digital revenues exceeded 50% of revenues last year, up almost 300%. Our loyal investors understand the inherent value of our assets and the scale of our dramatic transition, but we believe the market has yet to fully comprehend the magnitude of the metamorphosis or the future potential of our platform. We have been and expect to continue to generate significant free cash flow this fiscal year. And we have a $1 billion buyback plan well underway, and ample opportunity to be opportunistic. 
That opportunistic efficacy we've shown in our purchases of OPIS and CMA for Dow Jones, 2 high-margin digital businesses with recurring revenues, which have added much profitable prowess. Their impact means that we are at a pivotal point at our Dow Jones business. The B2B segment at Dow Jones is now outpacing the B2C segment in contributing to profit and at a far higher margin. 
The net result is that we expect both Dow Jones and News Corporation are becoming more profitable, more digital, and even less dependent on the ebb and flow of advertising. That is why we are highlighting the Dow Jones results today and expect to be providing increasing visibility over the coming year so that potential investors can appreciate the full glory of our valuable assets, while we intensify our institutional introspection on structure. 
As a reminder, Dow Jones profitability has more than doubled since we resegmented in fiscal 2020, generating close to $500 million in segment EBITDA last year with strong growth prospects ahead. And the EBITDA margin has been utterly transformed. In Q1 fiscal '18, it was approximately 9%. In Q1 fiscal '20, it was 12.8%. And in Q1 this fiscal year, 23.1%. We certainly agree with the perceptive commentators and analysts who suggest that News Corp is undervalued and its asset quality underappreciated. Our Board, our leaders, and our teams deserve much credit for skillfully navigating the turbulent media waters of the past decade, waters, which have proven treacherous for many media companies. 
As always, we remain focused on maximizing that value to the benefit of all shareholders. We are also looking to the future in maximizing the value of our premium content for AI. We are in advanced discussions with a range of digital companies that we anticipate will bring significant revenue in return for the use of our unmatched content sets. Generative AI engines are only sophisticated as their inputs and need constant replenishing to remain relevant, and we are proud to partner with responsible purveyors of AI products and their prescient leaders. 
One observation about generative AI, we often hear about misinformation and disinformation to the point where the very words have become politicized and polluted. The potential for the (inaudible) of the perverse will become ever more real with the inevitable inexorable rise of artificial intelligence. But however, artful the artificial intelligence, it is no match for great reporting and for genuine journalistic (inaudible). 
On the subject of journalism, I would like to pay tribute to our reporters in the Middle East and in Ukraine, who are each day taking calculated risks to bring insight and intelligence to readers around the world, during a period of unpredictable turbulence. And I would like to highlight the fate of Evan Gerskovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter who has been unjustly incarcerated in Russia for more than 7 months merely for doing his job as a journalist. 
Let me begin the more detailed exegesis with the increasingly valuable POS Dow Jones, where revenues rose 4% in Q1 despite the volatility of the ad market, while segment EBITDA was lifted by an impressive 10% as revenue and profit contribution continued to expand in the professional information business. Dow Jones offers a unique set of services and products for global business users and readers. As a result, many of our customers encounter Dow Jones products several times each day, not just the Wall Street Journal, Barron's, MarketWatch and Dow Jones Newswires, but also risk and compliance, Dow Jones Energy and Factiva. Risk and Compliance revenues surged 23%, thanks to increased demand from the financial and corporate sectors seeking to minimize risk and compliance. I trust all of the institutions on the call today aspire to those 2 worthy goals. R&C has expanded revenues by over 600%. Let me repeat that number, over 600% since we relaunched news in 2013. 
It's worth emphasizing that the business is fully digital and has retention rates of over 90%. Dow Jones Energy, which includes both OPIS and CMA continues to see excellent double-digit revenue growth driven in part by higher pricing and is exceeding our initial expectations, thanks to the global energy transition and opportunities emerging in renewable energy, along with continued reinvestment. Our customer base is growing as we launch compelling products and create critical pricing benchmarks. We are genuinely impressed by the vitality and drive an initiative among our new colleagues at both OPIS and CMA. 
Factiva is benefiting from its innovative partnership with Cision. And Factiva should be an important building block in the AI future given that it has a database of 33,000 sources in 32 languages from more than 200 countries and territories. That impressive content collection complements our contemporaneous news offerings as we seek to serve corporate, professional, and consumer audiences. Across Dow Jones, subscription volume remained strong with digital subscriptions reaching 4.6 million, up 12%, while total subscriptions reached 5.3 million, up 8%. Our teams are focused on reducing churn and maximizing the lifetime value of each and every subscriber. 
As for advertising, we saw a particular improvement in trends with the declines of past quarters abating and digital advertising down only 2%. In digital real estate, it was a tale of 2 markets during the quarter with the Australian property market improving and the U.S. market still bearing the burden of particularly high mortgage rates, which obviously suppressed demand. 
But it is fair to say that the revenue rebound in the Australian market certainly surpassed the sluggishness in the U.S. market. REA reported strong growth in listing volumes in the 2 key markets of Sydney and Melbourne, and our valued clients were keen to subscribe to premium products, thus improving yield. 
We also saw resounding top line performance and volumes remained strong in October. REA India is the #1 property portal in a country with a rapidly expanding middle class and both its audience and revenue continued to surge during the quarter. As REA has disclosed, the total audience in India in the quarter was up 16% year-over-year, while revenue during the quarter was 25% higher than a year ago. Given a relative political stability in India and ongoing economic growth, REA India is a jewel in the crown. 
In the U.S., Realtor.com, like the industry at large, was affected by the unusually high interest rates, which do appear to plateau and are expected to ease over the coming year. But these short-term conditions do not change our long-term optimism for Realtor to capitalize on the increasing digitization of the world's largest property market. It is easier by transient traffic in the short term, but that is merely a sugar high that leads to digital diabetes. 
We have a long-term commitment to all Americans who are buying and selling a home and to real estate professionals. We also have the ability to leverage our unique media platform from wsj.com to the New York Post, among many others, who had a combined monthly audience of over 200 million uniques in September. These are verified authenticated numbers, not an cocktail of cockamamie. Under Damian Eales' energetic decisive leadership, Realtor is building on the gains of his predecessors and focusing on developing core markets, core clients, and core profitability. The Realtor team is working ever more closely with REA executives in ways that are benefiting both businesses with the sharing of software, marketing mechanics, and AI insights. 
The script for our publishing business was completely rewritten in the first quarter. After a few difficult quarters, segment EBITDA at HarperCollins lipped 67%. Revenues posted a healthy 8% increase, and that growth, combined with cost initiatives undertaken over the past year and an easing of supply chain inflationary impacts recalibrated the performance at HarperCollins. The logistical upheaval at Amazon has passed, returned nets are far lower, and both the frontlist and backlist notch gains during the quarter. 
Among the many and varied strong sellers were Tom Lake by Ann Patchett, Demon Copperhead by Barbara Kingsover, The Collector by Daniel Silva, and Remarkably Bright Creatures by Shelby VanPelt. We saw particular strength in our Christian books business, including Rebar McEntire's Not That Fancy. Rebar was clearly not describing the HarperCollins performance. And speaking of Christian Books, we look forward to publishing a new book by His Holiness Pope Francis next spring. I would like to highlight our new partnership with Spotify to broaden the reach of audio books. This is a project we have discussed for some time with the Arsenal -- Daniel Ek, with whom I share a passion for books and for the Arsenal Football Club. 
The new partnership has begun with the U.K. and Australia and in the U.S. announced yesterday. And we are genuinely confident that it will be positive for both companies for authors and for those who love to read and to listen to books. This market has needed a strong new entrant and Daniel and his team are among the most skillful players on the pitch. 
At Subscription Video Services, revenues were up in constant currency for the seventh consecutive quarter. As expected, the decline in EBITDA was mainly due to sports right costs and ForEx fluctuations. But we have no doubt that our streaming strategy has been successful at a time when other companies in other markets are struggling. Overall, paid streaming subscriptions rose 8% on the same quarter last year, while broadcast churn was down from 14.2% to 11.4%, showing that the 2 products are undoubtedly complementary. 
But the team at Foxtel is far from complacent. And so we are on the cusp of launching our new streaming aggregation product, Hubbl, which will greatly simplify the search for fascinating entertainment and sports from our own companies and from those of our cherished partners to the benefit of all in particular, to the benefit of viewers. 
The News Media segment faced macroeconomic headwinds and volatility caused by algorithmic changes at the large platform, but these trends are more ephemeral than eternal. Subscriptions continue to increase at The Times and Sunday Times, which reported an 8% rise and at News Corp Australia, where we saw a 4% increase in digital subs. As I mentioned earlier, we are increasingly less reliant on advertising, which is now a smaller fraction of our overall revenue focused on digital recurring revenue streams. We saw strong performance at Wireless in the U.K., which had a record 45 million listening hours over the April to September period, up 17% from the prior year, according to RAJAR, led by sports and news. 
Our teams in the U.K. and Australia were also acutely cost conscious, and we are retooling the infrastructure to reflect the contemporary and future initiatives, including printing operations, advertising networks, and back office expenses. Rebekah and her teams in the U.K. have been leaders in creating programmatic ad partnerships, which enable all to increase yield and harvest valuable data. 
This was in another way and historic quarter. Our Executive Chair, Rupert Murdoch, announced that he will be transitioning to Chairman Emeritus next week at our AGM. I can personally assure you that there has been no change in his heightened levels of curiosity and energy since the announcement and his vast experience will be an important ongoing resource for the company. All of us at News Corp stand on the shoulders of a giant. 
And I genuinely look forward to Lachlan becoming sole chair next week. His thoughtful engagement with our teams already enhances the business each working day. And his passion for principal journalism is obvious to all who work with him. There is no doubt that Lachlan's multidisciplinary expertise and his philosophical integrity will be invaluable as we continue the next phase of our crucial journey. 
And now our team CFO, Susan Panuccio, will provide more financial granularity.
Thank you, Robert, and good afternoon, everyone. As Robert mentioned, we are pleased with the positive start to the new fiscal year, returning to revenue growth and posting the second consecutive quarter of profit growth despite the macroeconomic conditions. We have been diligently executing on our long-term plan to drive greater value for our shareholders and believe this is yet to be reflected in our current market value. 
Our first quarter total revenues were $2.5 billion, up 1% compared to the prior year, marking the first year-over-year revenue growth since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Adjusted revenues also grew 1% compared to the prior year. Total segment EBITDA was $364 million, up 4% compared to the prior year. HarperCollins was the largest contributor to the profit improvement, which is encouraging on the back of last year's challenging results. Adjusted total segment EBITDA grew 5% versus the prior year. For the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.05 compared to $0.07 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.16 in the quarter compared to $0.12 in the prior year. 
Moving on to the results for the individual reporting segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were $403 million, down 4% compared to the prior year, a notable improvement from the fourth quarter rate. On an adjusted basis, segment revenues declined just 2%. Despite the revenue decline, segment EBITDA rose 3% to $122 million due to higher contribution from the REA Group and cost-saving initiatives that move that were partially offset by revenue headwinds. Adjusted segment EBITDA rose a healthy 8%. 
REA had a very strong quarter, with revenues rising 4% year-on-year on a reported basis to $261 million, which included an $11 million or 4% negative impact from foreign exchange. Growth was driven by residential yield increases and growth in national listings, along with 25% revenue growth at REA India. Results were partially offset by modest decline in Financial Services revenues due to lower settlement activity. Overall, new buy listings rose 1%, with Sydney and Melbourne up 16% and 14%, respectively, enabling upward pressure on yields. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more details. 
Move's revenues of $142 million were down 16% compared to the prior year, relatively similar to the fourth quarter trend, absent the 53rd week impact. For the quarter, real estate revenues fell 20%, driven by lower lead and transaction volumes reflective of the broader industry trends. Lead volumes fell 11% year-over-year, while Realtor's average monthly unique users declined 12% from the prior year to 76 million in the first quarter based on internal metrics, but improved from 74 million in the fourth quarter. 
As Robert mentioned, despite challenging market and competitive conditions, we've made solid progress in Q1 across a number of strategic areas, including SEO improvements, expanding our sell-side offerings into the launch of a listing agent tool kit, deepening our collaboration with News Corp's powerful global platform to drive further reach, and the recent launch of a new brand campaign. 
Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $486 million, down approximately 3% compared to the prior year on a reported basis due to foreign currency headwinds. Importantly, on an adjusted basis, revenues rose 1% versus the prior year, the seventh consecutive quarter of growth. Streaming revenues accounted for 30% of circulation and subscription revenues versus 25% in the prior year, and again, more than offset broadcast revenue declines, benefiting from both a year-over-year increase in subscribers and price rises at Kayo and BINGE. 
Total closing paid subscribers across the Foxtel Group reached almost $4.6 million at quarter end, up 2% year-over-year. Total paid streaming subscribers were 3 million, increasing 8% versus the prior year, although declining sequentially impacted by less output at bids related to the strikes in Hollywood, as well as typical seasonality at Kayo due to the end of the winter sports codes in September. 
Foxtel ended the quarter with 1.3 million residential broadcast subscribers, down 9% year-over-year broadcast churn continued to improve, down 280 basis points year-over-year to 11.4%, while broadcast ARPU rose 3% to over AUD 85 helped in part by a price rise for non-platinum subscribers implemented in July. Segment EBITDA in the quarter of $93 million was down 16% versus the prior year driven by contractual price escalators in Foxtel sports rights agreements. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 13%. We completed the debt refinancing in the first quarter, which included securing a new AUD 1.2 billion credit facility. As we said last quarter, given the improved performance and the completion of the refinancing, this provides a pathway for repayment of our shareholder loans. 
Moving on to Dow Jones. Dow Jones had a strong quarter with revenues of $537 million, up 4% year-over-year despite fully lapping recent acquisitions. Digital revenues accounted for 12% of total revenues this quarter, up 2 percentage points from last year. Circulation and subscription-based revenues represented over 81% of total revenues, up approximately 1 percentage point from the prior year, underscoring the stability and recurring nature of the revenue base. On an adjusted basis, revenues grew 3%. We are continuing to see very strong growth in our professional information business with revenues rising 14% year-over-year driven by risk and compliance and strong gains at Dow Jones Energy. 
Factiva posted modest growth benefiting from a new licensing deal. Retention across B2B offerings remains at over 90% with nearly all of the revenues recurring. Risk and compliance revenues rose 23% with consistent growth between financials and corporates. Europe remained the largest territory at over 50% of revenues and also the fastest source of growth. Secular trends remain very favorable with global corporations navigating complex sanctions and trade guidance, particularly as it relates to Russia and China. 
We were really pleased with the 20% growth at Dow Jones Energy, which benefited from price escalators, the rollout of new products, and new customers. The results also benefited mid-single digits from onetime items and the World Chemical Forum, a new annual event this quarter, which leveraged the wider Dow Jones experience in corporate events. Circulation revenues gained 1% in the prior year, with digital-only subscriptions growing 12% year-over-year or 101,000 sequentially, which was principally driven by an increased focus on Dow Jones bundling offer as they look to better leverage subscription acquisition costs across multiple products, capitalize on minimal overlap between products, and drive greater engagement from customers. We believe that in the medium term, bundling will drive higher ARPU per subscriber and reduce long-term churn. 
Advertising revenues declined 3% to $91 million due to 6% and 2% declines in print and digital advertising revenues, respectively, with trends improving from the fourth quarter. Advertising accounted for 17% of total revenue was 66% being digital, up 100 basis points from last year. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter grew 10% to $124 million, with margins improving 120 basis points to 23.1%, the highest first quarter margin since News Corp's acquisition of Dow Jones, driven by the strong B2B performance, which is on track to be the largest contributor to Dow Jones profitability in fiscal 2024. 
At Book Publishing, we saw a big recovery from fiscal 2023 results. Revenues were $525 million, up 8%, while segment EBITDA improved 67% to $65 million compared to the prior year. Margins improved over 400 basis points to 12.4%. You will recall the results a year ago were significantly impacted by the Amazon reset of inventory levels and rightsizing of its warehouse footprint. The strong performance this quarter benefited from the success of some key front-list titles, as Robert mentioned, and also saw improvement in backlist sales, including a notable increase from Christian Publishing. 
Return rates improved materially, while inventory levels appear to have normalized. Inflationary costs are beginning to moderate with lower manufacturing costs helped by product mix and lower freight and distribution costs this quarter. The backlist contributed 61% of revenues, down from 65% last year, while digital sales rose 3% this quarter and accounted for 22% of consumer sales. Within the 22%, downloadable audio accounted for 45% of digital revenues. On an adjusted basis, revenues gained 6%, and segment EBITDA rose 59%. 
Turning to News Media. Overall trends continue to be mixed geographically. Revenues were $548 million, down 1% versus the prior year, while adjusted revenues declined 2%. Advertising declined 5% and was down 6% in constant currency. While circulation and subscription rose 2% and was flat in constant currency. At News Australia, advertising saw some improvement compared to the fourth quarter, while the U.K. weakened, notably in digital. As Robert mentioned, we did see declines in our traffic at several mastheads related to changes in algorithms at the large platforms which we are monitoring closely and have been felt across the wider publishing industry. 
Segment EBITDA of $14 million declined $4 million results included approximately $3 million related to onetime costs as a result of the proposed combination of printing operations in the U.K. with DMG. This initiative demonstrates the continued focus on driving cost efficiencies across our news media businesses. 
Before we look at the outlook for the next quarter, I would like to touch on free cash flow. First quarter free cash flow is typically lower due to the timing of working capital payments, including sports rights payments at Foxtel, and this year, it was also impacted from the lower HarperCollin sales in Q4 of the prior year. We anticipate generating strong and positive free cash flow for the year weighted to the second half, consistent with prior years. 
As for the outlook, similar to our comments last quarter, we are continuing to operate in a difficult environment that remains unpredictable in the short term. That said, we expect the second quarter to continue to show an improvement in revenues and profitability. 
Looking at each of our segments. At Digital Real Estate Services, Australian residential new buy listings for October grew 16%. Please refer to REA for a more specific outlook commentary. At Move, U.S. housing conditions remain challenging, and we are expecting some reinvestment in marketing to improve share of voice levels, including the recently launched advertising campaign, and also in product development to ensure we are best positioned to take advantage of market conditions when they improve. 
In Subscription Video Services, as mentioned last quarter, we continue to expect modestly higher expenses for the full year, driven by sports rights and some costs related to the launch of Foxtel streaming aggregation service, Hubbl, but remain on track to deliver relatively stable results for the year in local currency. At Dow Jones, we hope to see continued improvements in advertising declines, but as typical, visibility is limited. We continue to expect modestly higher overall expenses for the full year and strong revenue growth in B2B revenues. 
At Book Publishing, while we expect year-over-year improvements versus the prior year, revenue and profit growth is expected to be more modest than the first quarter given overall industry trends and the normalization of return rates. At News Media, revenue trends remain mixed geographically, and we will continue to focus on ongoing cost efficiencies. 
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A.
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Lucy Huang from UBS.
My one question is in relation to Move. So I just wonder if you can give us updating to the competitive landscape in the U.S.? And just any early thoughts on the recent U.S. court ruling around agent commissions. Like do you think this could have an impact on industry dynamics more broadly? And I guess, for the Move business longer term?
Yes, Lucy. Well, first of all, we'll have to see what transpires on appeal in that particular case. But it's clear that the U.S. property market has already been evolving if rather incrementally. I mean our focus is solely on providing the best possible service for vendors, for purchases, and for real estate professionals, and we'll continue to build audience through the use of our rather large media platforms. We've been taking advantage of the present downturn in the market to build out our sell-side operations. And there is definitely a downturn in existing home sales when you have an annual rate of $3.9 million, which is well below the normal average of $5.5 million. .
We certainly foresee stronger activity longer term on the sell side, a bit like the Australian market, and we've acquired a company UpNest, which is particularly strong in that area. And there are interesting lessons for the U.S. market generally from Australia about what happens when the market turns, patently much suppressed demand here at the moment. In Australia, we saw listings in Melbourne and Sydney surge 14% and 16% in the last quarter. And those numbers were even higher in October, Melbourne listings surged 32% and Sydney saw 33%. So we look forward to similar surging and soaring in the U.S. market when mortgage rates moderate.
Our next question comes from Alan Gould from Loop Capital.
Robert, I was wondering if you can get into a little bit more detail about this residulously reviewing our structure? And secondly, if you could comment on how the recent real estate lawsuit might affect the Realtor and Move?
I think, Alan, I answered the second question. just now. So we'll have to wait for the appeal there. The market itself is still obviously suffering from the heavy burden of mortgage rates here in the U.S. As for structure, look, we agree with the general thesis that the company has been transformed over the past decade, and the full value of our incomparable assets is not fully represented in the share price. 
And that's a tribute to the leaders of all our business from Rebekah in London to Patrick at Foxtel, and to all our teams who have navigated through fundamental changes in each of their sectors and through the pandemic and the subsequent surge in interest rates. And as you can divine from today's numbers, we are in a truly different position to most media companies with a robust balance sheet and are poised for even greater growth and profitability in the coming years when the economic heavens return to equilibrium. .
But at the same time, we are consciously and constantly reviewing our structure and have already taken tangible steps to clarify internal corporate structures to ensure that we have maximum flexibility in that overall structural consideration.
Our next question comes from David Karnovsky from JPMorgan.
This is Ted on for David. I wanted to ask if you could give us an update on digital ad trends. Any color you can share on the quarter and expectations moving forward would be appreciated?
Sure. Obviously, the trends across the mass heads vary by segment and region. And algorithm changes can have a short-term impact. Though we do have a strong relationship with both Google and Facebook, and they tend to respond thoughtfully to any infulicities that we identify. And I'd particularly like to call out Sundar Pichai and his trustee team, who are conscious of the importance of journalists and journalism. 
Specifically at Dow Jones, advertising was down 3%, which was a marked improvement after a 14% decline in the prior quarter. Both digital and fringe reported improvement in trend lines. And there was a more modest decline of 8% in the U.K., but most of that was actually in print as digital advertising was flat compared to the same quarter last year. And the New York Post, while flat overall, actually saw an increase in print-related advertising as the paper continued to expand its social, political and commercial reach.
Our next question comes from Entcho Raykovski from Evanson Partners.
Firstly, I just wanted to ask, given that there have been some public comments from a shareholder over the past month about a proposal to spin out REA, interested in your comment as to whether you see merit in that proposal, and is that something you're willing to explore? Or are you looking at other ways, as you've spoken about of closing the valuation gap. And if I can quickly throw a second one in there as well, hopefully, a straightforward one. Given the Foxtel refinance over the quarter, when do you think the shareholder lines will be repaid? Are there any other impediments or hurdles to that repayment taking place now?
It would obviously be inappropriate to comment on any shareholder in particular, and actually inappropriate to comment on any shareholder comment. But as I've made clear, we are conscientiously reviewing our structure and have taken steps corporately to ensure that we have maximum flexibility that of itself reflects the constant institutional introspection that characterizes the way we oversee these very valuable assets.
Entcho, just in relation to your question on Foxtel, we expect a modest return this year and anticipate the bulk of the repayments to come over the next few years. That's obviously dependent on the current plans and cash flow position.
Our next question comes from Craig Huber from Huber Research.
Great. Robert, it's nice to hear that you guys are reviewing your structure, and I have long talked about for the last 10 years or so. I mean, the company is very complicated from an investor -- an outside investor standpoint. So I'm glad to hear you guys are looking at it seriously. I mean when I look at the stock, I mean, I looked at a 35% to 40% conglomerate discount that's embedded in your stock in order to justify the stock at in the low 20s here and stuff. So I guess we'll see what happens. I hope some significant happens on that front. 
If I could ask a question about books. I mean it's nice to see the recovery from a year ago. Are you seeing anything in the book area, whether it be on the cost side or on the revenue side that would stop you from getting back to your EBITDA level that you're at in the low 300s back in fiscal '21 and '22?
Craig, look, obviously, HarperCollins is journey through a rather unique period of unusual circumstances, the pandemic, logistical issues at Amazon, cost pressures. And it has emerged from that confluence of complexity with a strong front back list and margins actually dramatically improvement, improving from the percent in the final quarter of last fiscal to 12.4%. So we are seeing that margin improvement already. And there's also no doubt that there's reason for excitement about the entry of Spotify into audio books. Over the past few years, audio books have been by far the fastest-growing sector. And Spotify itself has really transformed both the concept and the experience of streaming. 
And so Daniel Ek and I have been discussing audio books for a few years, and we've reached an agreement on a model that is great for orders, for book lovers, for Spotify, and for us. And the early signs from the U.K. and Australian markets are certainly positive. And if those trends hold, audio, which now comprise about 45% of digital sales will reach a far higher threshold level, we'll be generating significantly more revenue and as you asked, be improving our EBITDA.
And Craig, maybe just to add, we do expect continued profit growth in the balance of the year given certainly the prior year compares subject, of course, to that consumer demand that Robert talked about. But we expect it to be at a more modest rate than Q1. And we're hopeful that the EBITDA margin can remain positive to last year and in the low double digits for the full year, having delivered the 12.3% in Q1. So I expect that margin rate will be more over the medium term when we look to lift it.
Our next question comes from Brian Han from Morningstar.
Robert or Susan, can you please clarify, did you guys say in Dow Jones, B2B earnings are larger in B2C earnings? Or did you mean its contribution to growth is now larger than B2C?
They are larger and on track to be larger for the full year. So yes, we did say that.
On track to be larger.
And they were for the quarter .
And they're obviously a higher margin, digital high retention rates. .
Our next question comes from Darren Leung from Macquarie.
I just have one on Move, please. The real estate revenues were obviously down 20%, and you called out listings at 11%, pretty crude, but it sort of implies that yield average yield was down about 9%. Can you talk a little bit about the drivers on this front, please? And how we should be thinking about the yield driver in the remainder of the year?
Darren, we don't, as you know, give out specific yields. You may recollect that actually over the course of probably the last 18 months, we've been seeing increases in yields that have helped us offset some of those declines. You could imagine in the current market, it's obviously challenging to be pushing yields up in the U.S. So look, I think what we would say is that we just continue to balance where we think we can push yields in certain markets with the current macro environment. That's probably all we can say on that.
We can go to Craig Huber with a follow-up.
Yes. The follow-up question on Realtor.com, please. Can you maybe just comment a little further on what you're plan doing the cost side of the business for the rest of the fiscal year here? I understand obviously the pressure on the top line. But I mean, where do you guys think profits and Realtor.com are going to go the issue with issue on the top line from a macro standpoint, but you want to invest more, it sounds like on the R&D side and in marketing?
Craig. Look, I think if you think about the next quarter, you could probably expect cost to be relatively in line with what we've seen in Q1. As we mentioned, we do want to continue to invest in that business. We see a huge opportunity in that business when the market picks up, and we want to make sure that we're in the best position to take advantage of that. 
Some of the investment areas that we're looking at are building our product investment having a look at marketing, obviously, just given the competitive position there. It's really important that we do that. So we will probably back in some of those cost investments depending on how revenue trends.
Thank you. Leila. Any other questions?
There are no further questions on the line at this time.
Right. Well, thank you all for participating. Have a wonderful day, and we'll talk to you soon. Take care.

We Discuss Why REA Group Limited's (ASX:REA) CEO May Deserve A Higher Pay Packet

Shareholders will be pleased by the robust performance of 
 (
) recently and this will be kept in mind in the upcoming AGM on 15th of November. This would also be a chance for them to hear the board review the financial results, discuss future company strategy to further improve the business and vote on any resolutions such as executive remuneration. In our analysis below, we discuss why we think the CEO compensation looks acceptable and the case for a raise.
Our data indicates that REA Group Limited has a market capitalization of AU$21b, and total annual CEO compensation was reported as AU$4.6m for the year to June 2023. That's a fairly small increase of 6.6% over the previous year. We think total compensation is more important but our data shows that the CEO salary is lower, at AU$1.7m.
For comparison, other companies in the 
 with market capitalizations above AU$12b, reported a median total CEO compensation of AU$9.3m. This suggests that Owen Wilson is paid below the industry median. Moreover, Owen Wilson also holds AU$6.4m worth of REA Group stock directly under their own name, which reveals to us that they have a significant personal stake in the company.
Speaking on an industry level, nearly 55% of total compensation represents salary, while the remainder of 45% is other remuneration. REA Group pays a modest slice of remuneration through salary, as compared to the broader industry. If non-salary compensation dominates total pay, it's an indicator that the executive's salary is tied to company performance.
REA Group Limited has seen its earnings per share (EPS) increase by 47% a year over the past three years. In the last year, its revenue is down 1.8%.
Shareholders would be glad to know that the company has improved itself over the last few years. It's always a tough situation when revenues are not growing, but ultimately profits are more important. Looking ahead, you might want to check 
.
REA Group Limited has generated a total shareholder return of 20% over three years, so most shareholders would be reasonably content. But they probably don't want to see the CEO paid more than is normal for companies around the same size.
The company's overall performance, while not bad, could be better. If it manages to keep up the current streak, CEO remuneration could well be one of shareholders' least concerns. In fact, strategic decisions that could impact the future of the business might be a far more interesting topic for investors as it would help them set their longer-term expectations.
Shareholders may want to 
Arguably, business quality is much more important than CEO compensation levels. So check out this

Unidentified Analyst
Welcome to News Corp's Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. Media will be allowed on a listen-only basis. 
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Michael Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Thank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp's Fiscal Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago, and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com. 
On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We'll open with some prepared remarks, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community. 
This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information. 
Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in the earnings releases for the applicable periods posted on our website. 
With that, I'll pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.
For the second quarter in succession, News Corp has achieved growth in both revenue and profitability. And we believe there are strong prospects for further growth as difficult, inauspicious macroeconomic conditions ease in some of our markets. We saw particularly robust results across the 3 core pillars of our company: Dow Jones, Book Publishing and Digital Real Estate Services, where there was a resounding improvement in Australia in Q2. And there are early signs of recovery in the U.S. residential sector after the most sluggish market conditions in almost 3 decades. Given the potential of our world-leading brands, we remain intent on creating long-term value for investors. And as part of our commitment, our diligent, concerted review of the company's structure continues apace. 
Looking at the top line results. News Corp's second quarter revenues rose 3% to $2.6 billion, and profitability surged 16%, marking the third consecutive quarter of profit growth in testing economic times. Our net income for the quarter rose to $183 million from $94 million in the same quarter last year, while our reported EPS was $0.27 against $0.12 for the same period last year. 
The company's digital progress and prowess are increasingly evident. Halfway through fiscal 2024, digital now comprises approximately 52% of all revenues. That is more than an e-evolution. It is an e-revolution, one that has touched and transformed every element of every business, and we are far from satisfied, far from complacent, far from completion. 
We are seeing the collective benefit of our conscious strategic shift away from potentially volatile advertising revenues to growth in circulation and subscription revenues. In fiscal 2014, nearly half of News Corp revenues were from advertising, with 31% from circulation and subscriptions. There has been a fundamental metamorphosis. 
In the first half of the fiscal year, advertising had preceded to 16%, with circulation of subscriptions surging to 44%. Overall, News Corp as of Q2 had over 7 million subscriptions to our news brands, including The Wall Street Journal, Barron's, The Times and Sunday Times, The Australian and other publications. And we have an additional 4.3 million paid subscribers at Foxtel in Australia, which includes our popular streaming services Kayo and Binge. And those figures don't include the growing number of loyal subscribers at our professional information business at Dow Jones, where the average retention rate is comfortably above 90%. 
Artificial intelligence, with all its permutations and perturbations, will play an increasingly important role at most businesses. We expect to be a core content provider for generative AI companies who need the highest quality, timely content to ensure the relevance of their products. The [corny kilo] cliche is that AI companies are selling the picks and shovels during the seeming gold rush. Well, we are selectively reselling gold nuggets and those crucial negotiations are at an advanced stage. 
It is reassuring that certain digital companies appreciate the value of integrity, quality and creativity. And while certain other media companies prefer litigation, we prefer consultation as the former is merely creating a gold rush for lawyers. Courtship is preferable to courtrooms. We are wooing, not suing. But let's be clear, in my view, those who are repurposing our content without approval are stealing. They are undermining creativity. Counterfeiting is not creating, and the AI world is replete with content counterfeiters. 
I would like to compliment Sam Altman of OpenAI, who has shown a clear understanding of the social importance of journalism. He also appears to have emerged unscathed from his first visit to Davos, where there is always attitude at altitude. We are hopeful that, again, News Corp will be able to set meaningful global precedence with digital companies that will assist journalists and journalism and ensure that gen AI is not fueled by digital drops. 
We speak of the AI hallucinating, yet we, as a society, are hallucinating if we don't focus firmly on provenance at a time when even the very words misinformation and disinformation have themselves become sources of misinformation and disinformation. Too many media companies are scanning the landscape and presuming that they have a glimpse of the future and yet they cannot distinguish between trendiness and actual trends. Too many media companies, for too long, have been guilty of the Abilene Paradox. 
Before I turn to the results in detail, I must mention once again our colleague, Evan Gershkovich, who continues to be unjustly detained in a Moscow prison. He has been incarcerated for almost a year solely for being a highly professional journalist. We, at News Corp, and of course, Evan's family and many friends, hope that justice will prevail and that he will be released immediately. I would like to personally thank all those who publicly and not so publicly have been working diligently to secure his emancipation. 
Turning now to Dow Jones, which yet again achieved its highest level of quarterly revenues and profitability since News Corp's acquisition. That result is thanks to solid performance across the business, most notably in the increasingly successful professional information business, which remains on track to be the largest contributor to profitability at Dow Jones this fiscal year. 
The Professional Information Business is seeing robust growth due to the integration of Opus, which was completed ahead of schedule, and CMA, which is near complete. I would like to compliment, in particular, the News Corp Finance team for masterminding executing and delivering the Opus and Base Chemicals deals, which have been so critical to Dow Jones burgeoning growth. 
Executives at Dow Jones are far from smug and are building a bevy of new and compelling products. For example, Opus' Analytics Pro utilizes our database of more than 130,000 fuel stations to track visits and help customers assess their pricing strategies and market trends as well as compile customer loyalty rates and demographics, among other valuable, actionable data points. 
Meanwhile, Risk and Compliance's financial instruments product in partnership with BigTXN provides a fleet of R&C-sanctioned profiles mapped to commonly used financial instruments, which is crucial compliance cartography in a heavily regulated world. And DJ Integrity Check, our partnership with [Sapien], provides generative AI-driven insight into companies and relevant potentially problematic individuals. 
Subscriptions at the news business are continuing to grow. And during the month of January, average daily digital subscriptions to Dow Jones portfolio, including The Wall Street Journal, Barron's, MarketWatch and Investor's Business Daily, reached over 4.9 million, which represents more than double the pre-COVID average level of 2.4 million digital subscriptions in Q2 fiscal '20. 
The acceleration of digital subscription growth has been driven in part by the team's bundling of products, which is designed to increase reader engagement and reduce long-term churn. While we have purposely shifted emphasis to recurring revenues at Dow Jones, we are happy to report that although we faced some challenges in print advertising, digital advertising grew year-over-year for the first time since the first quarter of fiscal 2023. This positive result has been driven primarily by growth in the tech and automotive sectors and most notably at wsj.com. 
Digital Real Estate Services had a strong quarter, thanks largely to the prospering of REA, where there was 22% revenue growth year-over-year, fueled by an 8% increase in listings with heightened activity in the core Melbourne and Sydney markets and higher pricing. REA India continues to expand rapidly and reported over 19 million monthly average unique visitors in December, solidifying its lead as the foremost digital housing platform in the world's most populous country, where strong economic growth and political stability have created a platform for further expansion. 
At Move, realtor.com, continued to be affected by the high U.S. interest rates that have undermined activity in the market. But mortgage rates are beginning to moderate. And in recent weeks, there have been early signs of an increase in all important leads. 
The National Association of Realtors announced that the index for pending home sales increased just over 8% in December versus the prior year, the largest increase since June 2020. realtor.com's latest housing report revealed that January marked the third consecutive month of year-over-year inventory growth, with a 2.8% increase in newly listed homes for sale compared to January 2023. Unique users at REALTOR have also stabilized, with December comScore data signaling a return to growth. 
During the downturn, the realtor.com team has been assiduously improving the user experience, broadening the portfolio of products for our customers and bolstering the back-end technology, so we are poised to take full advantage of the incipient recovery in the U.S. housing market. 
HarperCollins had stellar results for the second successive quarter. This was thanks to strength in both the front list and the back list, notably in the blossoming audio books category. We saw 15% digital revenue growth in the quarter, fueled by a 29% audio books sales increase due to a flourishing market and our new partnership with Spotify. Spotify appears to be expanding demand for audio books and opening the category up to new consumers. I would like to commend our thoughtful partner, Daniel Ek, for his commitment to creativity. 
In Q2, we saw success with bestsellers like The Pioneer Woman Cooks—, Dinner's Ready! by Ree Drummond; The Little Liar by Mitch Albom; Ann Patchett's Tom Lake; and Barbara Kingsolver's Demon Copperhead. We also saw strong sales for Christian books, including The Great Disappearance by Dr. David Jeremiah, who is rapture ready, and The Bible itself. Looking ahead to Q3, we have great expectations for, among others, A.J. Finn's End of Story and I Am More Than by LeBron James. 
At Subscription Video Services, our new streaming aggregation product, Hubbl, is expected to launch next month and improve the search experience for our cherished customers seeking entertainment and sports. We believe Hubbl will be the most effective conduit between consumer and content and add to the Foxtel success story. In a volatile world, Foxtel has achieved 8 consecutive quarters of revenue growth in constant currency, while being acutely and astutely cost conscious in managing the transition to streaming. At Kayo, we are looking forward to the upcoming winter sports season for Australian rules football and Rugby League, the 2 dominant sports. And at Binge, there has been early success with advertising at the basic tier while continuing ad-free service for premium customers. 
In News Media, our news brands have seen improvement in traffic in recent weeks, a turnaround after convulsions in the first half, where there were algorithmic aberrations. Gratifyingly, we experienced digital subscription growth during the quarter. Rebekah Brooks and her team at News U.K., have overseen continuing progress at The Times and Sunday Times, which set a new record for the quarter in digital subscriptions, at 575,000, and saw significant digital ad growth, up 21% on a reported basis and over 15% in local currency. 
We expect the success of The Times to continue beyond Britain's borders with the imminent digital launch of The Times in the U.S. We are confident that it will resonate with discerning readers hungry for objective news coverage in a market saturated with narrative non-journalism. 
At News Corp Australia, news.com.au was again the country's leading news web with nearly 13 million monthly uniques in December according to metrics from Ipsos. And The New York Post is again on course to be profitable and has expanded its positive political influence in these vexed and vexing times. 
With the strong results in Q2 and Q1, we are off to a sterling start in fiscal year 2024, which follows the 3 most profitable years for the new News Corp. We can sense that investors are beginning to appreciate keenly the value of our brands and the potential of our portfolio. 
On behalf of all our investors, we have transformed free cash flow generation, bolstered our balance sheet, initiated a dividend and are continuing our $1 billion buyback plan. For that transformative success, I would like to pay tribute to the strategic support of Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch and to our highly engaged directors and to the commitment of our employees around the world. 
I am now pleased to turn to my talented colleague, Susan Panuccio, who will elaborate on these bouyant results.
Thank you, Robert, and good afternoon to everyone. As Robert mentioned, we had a strong second quarter, resulting in first half year-over-year improvements in both profitability and revenues. We continue to transform the company and move towards higher recurring and digital revenues, together with exercising strong capital allocation discipline and balancing reinvestment across the portfolio with ongoing fixed cost reductions. 
Our second quarter total revenues were $2.6 billion, up 3% compared to the prior year, an increase from the 1% growth delivered in the first quarter. Adjusted revenues grew 2% compared to the prior year. Total segment EBITDA was $473 million for the quarter, up 16% compared to the prior year, driven by strong performances across our 3 key growth pillars: Book Publishing, Digital Real Estate Services and Dow Jones, which all posted double-digit profit gains. In fact, in the aggregate, those key segments delivered 24% profitability growth this quarter. 
Our second quarter total segment EBITDA was also the highest in 2 years adjusted total segment EBITDA grew 14% versus the prior year. For the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.27 compared to $0.12 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.26 in the quarter compared to $0.14 in the prior year. 
Moving on to the results for the individual reporting segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were for $419 million, up 9%, a notable improvement from the first quarter rate and a return to revenue growth for the first time since the fourth quarter of financial year 2022. On an adjusted basis, segment revenues rose 8%. Segment EBITDA rose an impressive 15% to $147 million due to a higher contribution from the REA Group, partially offset by revenue headwinds at Move. Adjusted segment EBITDA rose a healthy 16%. 
REA had another very strong quarter with revenues rising 22% year-on-year on a reported basis to a quarterly record of $292 million with minimal impact from foreign exchange. Growth was again primarily driven by residential yield increases, improved growth in national listings favorable geographic mix and customer contract upgrades. Overall, new buy listings rose approximately 8%, with Melbourne up 24% and Sydney up 22%. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call, which will commence directly after hours for more details. 
Move's revenues of $127 million were down 13% compared to the prior year, with declines moderating from recent quarters. For the quarter, real estate revenues fell 14%, driven by lower lead and transaction volume, reflective of the broader industry trends. Lead volumes fell 7% year-over-year with December improving to down just 2%, benefiting from a combination of easier comparisons as well as recent declines in mortgage rates. Average monthly unique users for the quarter were flat compared to the prior year, at 66 million. 
The U.S. housing environment remains tough, with existing home sales hitting 30-year lows, although we are hopeful the market will start to show improvement in the second half given recent declines in mortgage rates. That said, irrespective of any market considerations, we are determined to strengthen realtor.com's product and content offering so it's best positioned for success when the housing market moves. 
To that end, the realtor.com team is focused on executing several key strategic priorities, which include modernizing the technology platform to help with unifying the customer experience across all platforms; creating unique and scaled data for proprietary content to assist with increased personalization; leveraging News Corp's network in relation to AI initiatives and capturing audience share; and accelerating the diversification of revenues with a greater focus on the sell-side offering. 
Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $470 million, up 2% compared to the prior year. On an adjusted basis, revenues rose 3% versus the prior year. Streaming revenues accounted for 29% of circulation and subscription revenues versus 26% in the prior year. Total closing paid subscribers across the Foxtel Group were over 4.3 million a quarter and flat with the prior year. Total paid streaming subscribers were 2.8 million, increasing 4% versus the prior year, although declining sequentially due to seasonality at Kayo, tougher financial conditions caused by the inflationary environment for consumers and a weaker sports cycle. 
Foxtel ended the quarter with 1.3 million residential broadcast subscribers, dowant to 9% year-over-year. Broadcast churn was flat at 12.9% despite the final migration of cable in October. While broadcast ARPU rose 3% to approximately AUD 86, helped in part by a price rise for non-platinum subscribers implemented in July. 
Segment EBITDA in the quarter of $77 million was down 14% versus the prior year, driven by contractual price escalators in Foxtel sports rights agreements and $10 million related to the upcoming launch of Hubbl, partially offset by higher revenues and lower technology and marketing costs. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 13%. 
Moving on to Dow Jones. As Robert mentioned, the second quarter results delivered the highest quarterly revenue and segment EBITDA performance since the acquisition of Dow Jones over 15 years ago. Dow Jones delivered revenues of $584 million, up 4% year-over-year, which made Dow Jones the highest segment revenue contributor for the quarter for the first time since it was resegmented. 
Digital revenues accounted for 78% of total revenues this quarter, up 2 percentage points from last year. Circulation and subscription-based revenues represented almost 76% of total revenues, up approximately 2 percentage points from the prior year, reinforcing the stability and recurring nature of the revenue base. On an adjusted basis, revenues grew 3%. 
We had very strong growth at PIB with revenues rising 13% year-over-year, including 16% growth at Risk and Compliance to $72 million and 15% growth at Dow Jones Energy to $62 million. Factiva again posted growth, benefiting from a new licensing deal. Total [pretension] rates remain very strong at over 90%. We are continuing to review our disclosures with the primary focus on increasing transparency to help the market appropriately value Dow Jones. To that end, we are now providing revenues for both Risk and Compliance and Dow Jones Energy in the 10-Q. 
Within the Dow Jones consumer business, circulation revenues were flat versus the prior year, with digital-only subscriptions growing 15% year-over-year or by 135,000 sequentially, driven by an increased focus on the Dow Jones bundling offer as they look to better leverage subscription acquisition costs across multiple products, capitalize on minimal overlapping between products and drive greater engagement. Bundling accounted for over 70% of the incremental digital-only volume growth in quarter 2. 
Advertising revenues declined 4% to $126 million, relatively stable with the first quarter rate, although digital returned to year-over-year revenue growth for the first time since the first quarter of financial year '23, rising 1%, driven by strength in the technology and auto categories. Print declined 11% due to weaknesses in financial services. Digital represented 62% of advertising revenues, up 59% last year. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter grew 17% to $163 million and was the largest segment EBITDA contributor with margins improving 320 basis points to 27.9%, driven by the strong B2B performance, which remains on track to be the largest contributor to Dow Jones profitability in fiscal 2024. Cost declined about 1%, driven by head count reductions and lower newsprint production and distribution costs, in addition to phasing of sales and marketing miniature. 
At Book Publishing, financial performance, again, meaningfully exceeded our expectations, particularly in profitability. Revenues were $550 million, up 4%, while segment EBITDA improved 67% to $85 million compared to the prior year. Margins increased by almost 600 basis points to 15.5%. The strong performance this quarter benefited from the success of some key front-list titles, as Robert mentioned, and saw improvement in backlist sales, including a notable increase from Christian publishing. Churn rates again improved materially due to better sell-through compared to last year, while inventory levels appear to have normalized across our distribution network. 
Inflationary costs moderated with lower manufacturing costs, helped by product mix and lower freight and distribution costs this quarter. The backlist contributed 60% of revenues, up from 57% last year, while digital sales rose 15% this quarter and accounted for 21% of consumer sales. Downloadable audio accounted for nearly 50% of digital sales, a record high, and we are pleased with the early positive signs from our partnership with Spotify, which generated incremental digital revenues and EBITDA this quarter. As way of background, Spotify is a usage-based model, not a pooled model. On an adjusted basis, revenues gained 2% and segment EBITDA rose 65%. 
Turning to News Media. Performance in this segment was more challenged. Revenues were $563 million, down 3% versus the prior year, while adjusted revenues declined 5%. Advertising declined 9% and were down 11% in constant currency, while circulation and subscription rose 5% and was up 2% in constant currency, benefiting from cover price increases. Advertising remained particularly challenged, with digital advertising trends again negatively impacted by the lower traffic at several mastheads related to changes in algorithms at the large platforms. That said, as Robert noted, encouraging me, we are seeing some recovery in recent weeks, particularly at The Sun in the U.S. 
Segment EBITDA of $52 million, declined $7 million, which was due to the lower revenue, partly offset by lower print volume and newsprint and lower spend at talkTV. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 15%. 
As for the outlook, similar to our comments last quarter, it is challenging to forecast in the short term, albeit economic conditions vary across markets. 
Looking at each of our segments. At Digital Real Estate Services, Australian residential new buy listings for January grew 12%. Please refer to REA for a more specific outlook commentary. At Move, we hope to see continued improvements in lead volumes, with January up 1% year-over-year, given recent declines in borrowing costs, albeit off low prior year comparisons. As we mentioned last quarter, we are expecting some reinvestment in marketing and product development in the second half, increasing from depressed levels last year, which will be partially offset by cost reductions elsewhere. 
In Subscription Video Services, as mentioned last quarter, we continue to expect modestly higher expenses for the full year, ongoing inflationary pressures, fewer new releases across entertainment due to the writers and actors' strike and a weaker summer sports schedule has created softness in streaming revenues, which may impact full year profitability in local currency. 
At Dow Jones, we expect strong revenue and profitability performance, underpinned by the transformation of our B2B offerings, and as mentioned previously, continue to expect modestly higher overall expenses for the full year. 
At Book Publishing, overall industry revenue trends remain relatively stable, and we are encouraged by the strength in the downloadable audio. We continue to expect margins to improve versus the prior year. 
At News Media, advertising revenue trends remain challenging, particularly in Australia, and we will continue to focus on ongoing cost efficiencies. Finally, given the current spot rate for the Australian dollar versus the U.S. dollar, we do expect some negative translation in the third quarter. 
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A.
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from David Karnovsky from JPMorgan.
I guess the AI topic, Robert, you noted in the release you expect to be a core content provider for gen AI companies. Maybe you can speak a bit to current negotiations. What are the key sticking points key priorities for you or even the red lines for News Corp as you engage on this?
Yes, David, obviously, there's confidential negotiations, and so I can't go into too much detail. I mean it is fair to say that we've been leading the intellectual debate among media companies on AI. And it's also fair to say that we're probably leading the commercial discussions. I mean, 17 years ago, when prestige-craving media executives were sashaying with Silicon Valley, we were raising down stats about providence but also about the [valuable] impact on vulnerable young people of the smartest engineers on the planet creating compulsive-addictive experiences. 
Anyway, we're certainly not naive as well about the potentially positive and negative impacts of AI on our journalism, our creativity, our content. We've had almost 2 decades of distribution, dominating creation and almost 60%-or-so journalists have lost jobs in the U.S. And candidly, unfortunately, a certain percentage of that is down to journalistic pomposity and price consciousness, not audience consciousness and relevance consciousness. 
But AI is a hyper-effective form of -- or gen AI is a hyper-effective form of derivative distribution. It's retrospective, not prospective. And the thoughtful AI companies understand that fact. And so that's why on this occasion, I would like to highlight the thoughtfulness of Sam Altman. Thoughtful people do understand that counterfeiting is not creating. And crucially, in this exceedingly erratic era, we have deep facts, not deep fakes.
Our next question comes from [Anja Rakowski] from Evans & Partners.
Robert, maybe if I can pick up on the generative AI question as well. I appreciate there's only so much you can say, but how do you think about the potential payments which could come for the value of your content relative to what you're currently receiving from the digital platforms? Is it a similar sort of quantum? Could it be even a greater quantum over time, at least on a relative basis, I'd be interested in how you're thinking about it. And longer term, do you expect that those payments from the digital platforms will continue to come through?
And so I'm sorry to be a basic, but I simply can't comment on the content and the negotiations. But I can't say they're at an advanced stage, and we are dealing with willing partners.
Next question comes from Kane Hannan from Goldman Sachs.
Maybe just on Dow Jones. I think the costs were down about $3 million in the quarter. Can you just talk a bit more about the [downtown] cost base, whether we can extrapolate that sort of performance going forward? And maybe as a follow-on to that, just the Professional Information Services within Dow Jones. I mean, obviously, extra disclosure. Did that business see margin expansion in the quarter? Or is the strong margin expansion, the Dow Jones overall, more of a mix and cost out in the other businesses?
Hi, Kane, welcome back. Look, just in relation to the costs, we did see a pretty good cost performance for the first half at Dow Jones. And I think like all our businesses, they are pretty cost focused. So they do constantly have a look at transformation opportunities within the business, and they certainly participated in the 5% headcount reduction, and they're getting the benefit of that. But like all the businesses, we do like to invest in them. So we do see variable costs going up as the revenue scales. They have had inflationary costs in relation to headcount, and we'll continue to invest in headcount given the growth in that business. In the second half of the year, we would expect to see some phasing and additional costs coming through from marketing. We do tend to have seasonally higher net adds in the second half than we do in the first half. And so that typically warrants some additional marketing costs. So that's sort of in relation to the cost base. 
And then in relation to PIB, we don't give out the margins, as you know, but the PIB margins did improve for the quarter, which was really pleasing to see as they continue to scale that business. And as we said in our prepared remarks, for the full year, we're continuing to expect to see the majority of the profit come from the PIB segment.
Yes. And just to supplement Susan's answer, obviously, there was a priority for Dow Jones and for News Corp. And we are providing more visibility overall, Jones because it's such a positive story. And frankly, the more you see, the more you like. 
I mean overall, the margin at Dow Jones has risen from 24.7% a year ago to 27.9% and now that we're lapping the purchases of Opus and CMA, the strong growth rates are clear at these companies, which we have grouped into Dow Jones Energy, where revenues expanded by 15% and it is also, though, worth noting the result of the always burgeoning Risk and Compliance segment where revenues rose 16%. In short, these high-margin recurring businesses providing essential services and thus have renewal rates well north of 90%.
Our next question comes from Craig Huber from Huber Research.
Great. I wanted to ask, on the portfolio review and simplification announced that you mentioned 3 months ago and you briefly touched on it today. Can you just give us a further update. I'm just curious on the timing of this. I mean, I personally didn't expect a major announcement within just the first 3 months, but also the flip side, when it is expected to take another 6-plus months from this stage going forward? Do you just give us a little sense of the timing there? I mean, I assume you guys did an awful lot of work behind the scenes before you even talked about it 3 months ago in your conference call. You've certainly done some -- I'm sure some of these last 3 months. Just give us a little bit sense of the timing when we might get an announcement here, please?
Craig, your presumption about preparation is not your conceived, but this being a rather sophisticated audience one which understands the nuances of phrases and the subtleties of the SEC. You can take the words I used in my statement as purposefully delivered. There is clearly much introspection, not casual, not peripheral. But significant serious introspection about structure, and it's functional, not emotional. 
And the prevailing truth is that we have created options for our shareholders, and that's a tribute to all at News Corp with the active support of enlighten Board and leadership from Rupert and Lachlan and the efforts of our employees around the world. Let us not forget that (inaudible) investment bankers were decidedly down beat at the time of the split a decade ago. And now, however, the discussion is how to get full value from, how to fully monetize a precious prestigious portfolio that has an obvious growth trajectory. That is indeed not an evolution, but a revolution.
Our next question comes from Lucy Huang from UBS.
Robert, Susan. My question is on PIB as well. Given we're kind of getting through the end of the [interaction of a person] CMA. Just wondering strategically how you're thinking about the growth in the business? And are there any other data sets that you would be looking to maybe build-out acquire over time? Like are there intentions or, I guess, capabilities you'll like to plug with PIB?
Listen, obviously, we're pleased with the progress of the PIB business. And as I said, you can see the overall increase in margin at Dow Jones, and that is to a large extent due to the success of the big businesses. I can't get into any more details about what our plans are. But needless to say, PIB is core to Dow Jones and its quarter News Corp.
And Lucy, what I say is that the thing that's great about PIB and the energy businesses is that the new products can leverage the existing data sets that we have, so the pricing, reporting analytics and newsletters and they can draw off a lot of the core data that we have. So I think that's fantastic. And I think Robert's mentioned in previous quarters, we've got areas like renewables that are coming in that we really think that could provide an exciting opportunity for us.
Thank you, Lucy.
Our next question comes from Brian Han from Morningstar.
Susan, I noticed the second quarter PCP growth in books EBITDA is exactly the same as the first quarter PCP growth, both exactly, I think, 2/3 up on prior period. Is there some sort of a contracted step-up in earnings for books? Or is that just pure coincidence?
I'd like to think they would be at that level, but no. No, I think it's just a coincidence. Look, we -- as we sort of said in the remarks, the Book Publishing segment has continued to exceed our expectations. And look, it's partly because we've had a return to more stability in the revenue post-COVID. So the returns have settled down and the market has settled down a little bit. 
And it's also partly because of the great work that the HarperCollins team has done in relation to their cost base. I mean in the face of some pretty challenging conditions last year, they also took the opportunity to push through some price rises on books. So a combination of all of that has really helped with putting the good results in for the first half. Look, I think across the full year, we're still expecting margins to be sort of in the low double digits, a good improvement from the prior year, but probably not to the levels that we've seen in the first half.
Thank you, Brian. We will take our next question, please.
Our next question comes from Darren Leung from Macquarie.
I just wanted to ask a bit about the cost-out program. Can you give us a feel as to how much has been completed so far this fiscal year of the previous $160 million number. And just a feel for -- do you expect more of it to be [weighted] in third quarter or fourth quarter? Maybe another way to answer the question is what the [Dow Jones] should we expect to see a lot of this cost out come from, please?
Yes. Look, it's pleasing to say that actually, we quoted, I think, Dow Jones' number in relation to that cost-out program, and we are going to exceed that number. And actually, from a run rate perspective, we're pretty much there already. We have said in previous statements though, that's the gross cost savings, and we do have reinvestments across our businesses, as you can see within Dow Jones, within our REA, [Legacy News] with the Hubbl launch. And so that is the gross cost savings. What I would say is, notwithstanding that we are always looking at cost savings across our businesses. And so that was pertaining just to headcount reductions. We're constantly looking at our cost base and workflows and our efficiencies, and we do continue to drive great savings on that, which helps us reinvest in these businesses.
And Darren, I'd just like to supplement Susan's point, we are not going to let these excellent results in any way, induce complacency in the company. All the teams are extremely cost conscious. And we're already seeing very interesting trends in the ability of AI to risk costs related to technology spend to the creation of code to the cultivation of code. And so not only are we going to be pursuing our conventional costs, but we're looking ahead and trying to make the most of new developments.
Thank you. Darren. We'll take our next question, please.
(Operator Instructions). At this time, we have no further questions. I'll now hand over to Michael Florin for closing remarks.
Well, thank you, Leila, and thank you all for participating. Have a wonderful day, and we will talk to you soon. Take care.

REA Group's (ASX:REA) investors will be pleased with their impressive 156% return over the last five years

The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. One great example is 
 (ASX:REA) which saw its share price drive 142% higher over five years. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 16% gain in the last three months.
With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.
There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.
Over half a decade, REA Group managed to grow its earnings per share at 7.0% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 19% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth. This favorable sentiment is reflected in its (fairly optimistic) P/E ratio of 66.59.
You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).
It is of course excellent to see how REA Group has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. Take a more thorough look at REA Group's financial health with this 
 report on its balance sheet.
As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for REA Group the TSR over the last 5 years was 156%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!
We're pleased to report that REA Group shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 66% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 21%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. Most investors take the time to check the data on insider transactions. You can click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling.

REA Group Limited's (ASX:REA) Stock Has Shown A Decent Performance: Have Financials A Role To Play?

REA Group's (ASX:REA) stock up by 6.0% over the past three months. As most would know, long-term fundamentals have a strong correlation with market price movements, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. Particularly, we will be paying attention to 
 ROE today.
Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.
The 
 is:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for REA Group is:
18% = AU$272m ÷ AU$1.5b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).
The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each A$1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made A$0.18 in profit.
We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or "retains" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
To start with, REA Group's ROE looks acceptable. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 8.1%. Probably as a result of this, REA Group was able to see an impressive net income growth of 22% over the last five years. However, there could also be other causes behind this growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.
We then compared REA Group's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 28% in the same 5-year period, which is a bit concerning.
Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. If you're wondering about REA Group's's valuation, check out 
, as compared to its industry.
The high three-year median payout ratio of 59% (implying that it keeps only 41% of profits) for REA Group suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of the earnings to its shareholders.
Moreover, REA Group is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 58%. However, REA Group's ROE is predicted to rise to 30% despite there being no anticipated change in its payout ratio.
Overall, we feel that REA Group certainly does have some positive factors to consider. The company has grown its earnings moderately as previously discussed. Still, the high ROE could have been even more beneficial to investors had the company been reinvesting more of its profits. As highlighted earlier, the current reinvestment rate appears to be quite low. We also studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that the company's earnings growth is expected be similar to its current growth rate.

Public companies account for 61% of REA Group Limited's (ASX:REA) ownership, while individual investors account for 27%

A look at the shareholders of REA Group Limited (
) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that public companies own the lion's share in the company with 61% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).
Individual investors, on the other hand, account for 27% of the company's stockholders.
Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of REA Group, beginning with the chart below.
Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.
We can see that REA Group does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at REA Group's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.
Hedge funds don't have many shares in REA Group. Our data shows that News Corporation is the largest shareholder with 61% of shares outstanding. With such a huge stake in the ownership, we infer that they have significant control of the future of the company. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 1.7% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 1.3% by the third-largest shareholder.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.
The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of REA Group Limited. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own AU$99m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking 
With a 27% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over REA Group. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.
It appears to us that public companies own 61% of REA Group. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.
It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand REA Group better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 
 that you should be aware of before investing here.

REA Group (ASX:REA) Will Want To Turn Around Its Return Trends

Did you know there are some financial metrics that can provide clues of a potential multi-bagger? Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing 
 on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's 
 of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. So while 
 (
) has a high ROCE right now, lets see what we can decipher from how returns are changing.
For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for REA Group:
0.26 = AU$622m ÷ (AU$2.7b - AU$321m) 
.
So, 
 In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Interactive Media and Services industry average of 8.0%.
Above you can see how the current ROCE for REA Group compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our 
 
.
On the surface, the trend of ROCE at REA Group doesn't inspire confidence. While it's comforting that the ROCE is high, five years ago it was 41%. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.
On a side note, REA Group has done well to pay down its current liabilities to 12% of total assets. So we could link some of this to the decrease in ROCE. What's more, this can reduce some aspects of risk to the business because now the company's suppliers or short-term creditors are funding less of its operations. Since the business is basically funding more of its operations with it's own money, you could argue this has made the business less efficient at generating ROCE.
In summary, REA Group is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. Investors must think there's better things to come because the stock has knocked it out of the park, delivering a 153% gain to shareholders who have held over the last five years. However, unless these underlying trends turn more positive, we wouldn't get our hopes up too high.
One more thing to note, we've identified 
and understanding it should be part of your investment process.
REA Group is not the only stock earning high returns. If you'd like to see more, check out our

Welcome to News Corp's Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Michael Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Thank you very much, Operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp's Fiscal Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago, and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com.
On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We will open with some prepared remarks, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community. 
This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information. 
Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in the earnings release for the applicable periods posted on our website. 
With that, I'll pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.
Thank you, Mike. News Corp has again made substantial progress on our strategic imperative to transform the company and increase value for all shareholders. Our profitability rose slightly in the third quarter as compared to the prior year, continuing our growth this fiscal year and that increase follows the 3 most profitable years since the company was reincarnated in 2013. 
That improvement, which gathered pace in April, came despite certain macroeconomic circumstances that were far from auspicious, whether a strong dollar that devalued our revenues outside the U.S., particularly in Australia, or the punitively high mortgage rates that obviously undermined activity in the U.S. housing market. 
The U.S. housing market contrasts starkly with that of Australia, where strong performance underpinned robust revenue growth at Digital Real Estate Services. While at Dow Jones, the professional information business continued to prosper and the segment's profit margin expanded from 20.6% to 21.7%. 
We remain well on track for the full year of strong results at News Corp. It is, by the way, worth highlighting that our free cash flow in the first 3 quarters was $491 million, a 53% increase on the $320 million for the same period last year. It is also worth noting that for more than a year, digital revenue has accounted for over half of our total revenues, and we believe that trend is destined to continue. 
We are in the midst of an exponential digital revolution, and our own company has continued to change significantly and profitably. Importantly, we are working to promote our quality journalism in the age of generative AI and are gratified that the most enlightened leaders in the industry appreciate the commercial and social value of that content. 
Separately to that end, we have this week extended our existing partnership with Google. As mentioned previously, we have been reviewing our company's structure and that work is intense and ongoing, and we have made underlying changes to provide maximum flexibility. 
Through 3 quarters of fiscal '24, circulation and subscriptions accounted for 45% of revenues, with advertising at a modest 16%. 10 years ago, we were dependent on advertising for almost half our revenues. Most tellingly, advertising at News Media, then our largest source of revenue now accounts for only 8% of total revenue. I should repeat that number, 8%, and half of that figure is now digital advertising. So the character of the company has fundamentally changed. 
Dow Jones continue to increase both revenue and profitability this quarter. The professional information business at Dow Jones is an increasingly powerful earnings engine with yet another quarter of double-digit revenue growth. It remains on track to be the largest contributor to the segment's profitability by the end of this fiscal year, and we believe far into the future, given its high margins and 90-plus percent retention rate. 
Dow Jones Energy, where revenues rose 15%, has just launched the APAC Carbon Market Report, which provides data and insights into emissions trading in Australia, China, New Zealand and South Korea. This important new offering complements OPIS's carbon price coverage for North America and other international markets. 
At Risk & Compliance, where revenues also rose 15%, the team debuted its first Gen AI-powered product, Integrity Check, a fully automated research platform that rapidly produces due diligence reports on businesses and individuals from our unique database. Created in partnership with SAPIEN, Integrity Check will help companies ensure they are compliant in a fiendishly complicated and legally fraud regulatory environment. 
Digital subscriptions at Dow Jones increased 17% year-over-year and experienced the highest sequential quarterly net growth, with 322,000 added in the third quarter. Average daily digital subscriptions to Dow Jones brands, including The Wall Sheet Journal, Barron's, MarketWatch, Investor's Business Daily crossed 5 million for the first time during Q3. That total is approximately double the number 4 years ago. 
Given the access to a bundle of premium products with The Wall Street Journal at the heart, the Dow Jones team is confident we should see a reduction in churn and an increase in circulation revenues in quarters to come. 
As for advertising, the market for print remains somewhat soft, though digital advertising rose 4% compared to the prior year, and advertising trends overall improved on the preceding quarter. 
In digital real estate, REA continued to show robust growth, with revenues surging 15% year-over-year, a 6% increase in listings across Australia helped spur that success. And I should note that listing growth has again improved in April compared to March, which we believe augurs well for the fourth quarter. REA also remains by far the #1 digital real estate platform in Australia, with 4.1x more monthly visits on average than its nearest competitor. 
That strength and enhanced product mix for its customers enabled REA to introduce 10% average price increases. That new pricing schedule will apply from July, and we look forward to the benefits in the next fiscal year. 
Meanwhile, we are pleased with the continuing progress at REA India, with a 31% advance in revenues in the quarter. Outside, Housing.com is the leading digital real estate platform in the most populous country in the world. Given that country's economic growth, widely forecast to be around 7% this year and the prospect of ongoing political continuity, we are confident that we have a world-class asset with much potential for expansion. 
At Move, we are obviously subject to abnormal aberrant conditions in a U.S. housing market, buffeted by high interest rates. However, revenue declines moderated this quarter and lead volume has turned positive for the first time in 2 years. The results this quarter are broadly consistent with our expectations, and we are improving the product and user experience to position ourselves to take advantage when the market trends change from headwind to tailwind. 
In the wake of legal developments involving the National Association of Realtors, I would echo Move's CEO, Damian Eales' recent perspicacious comments about the importance of buy-side agents for those seeking professional guidance when purchasing a home, which is surely the most significant investment decision for many families. 
We continue to closely monitor industry developments, but believe realtor.com is well positioned to capitalize on its relationship with homebuyers and with buyers and sell-side agents in this evolving landscape. We expect that interest rates will ultimately ease, and our experience in Australia suggests that the market will surge dramatically after an extended period of suppressed activity. 
It is worth noting, our landmark rental agreement between realtor.com and Zillow. This deal upgrades the rental experience for consumers and allows landlords and property managers to benefit from the combined audience of both the realtor.com and Zillow platforms. There is also a clear financial benefit for realtor.com, which will allow us to focus on our core buy and sell-side offerings. 
Finally, I would point out that in March, according to Comscore, a verified third-party source, REALTOR's unique users grew 5% month-over-month, comparing very favorably to Homes.com, which experienced a decline in the same period. Moreover, realtor.com is 1.4x bigger in terms of monthly unique users and has approximately 3x the page views and minutes per visit. 
Independent verification ensures statistical sumpsimus, not metrics mumpsimus. Our media platforms from The Wall Street Journal to the New York Post and MarketWatch and Bible Gateway give us a distinct advantage in expanding reach and building brands. 
Speaking of Bible Gateway, at HarperCollins, while revenues for the quarter were slightly behind the record Q3 results in the prior year, segment EBITDA rose 2%. And for the year-to-date period, EBITDA was 40% higher. In April, we saw a stronger performance and hope that will continue for the fourth quarter. 
We continue to believe the audio book market holds much promise, especially given our unique partnership with Spotify, which has already broadened the book audience. We hope to benefit from Spotify's recent expansion of its audio offerings to Canada, Ireland and New Zealand. And by the way, fueled by the growth of audio books, HarperCollins digital revenues hit 25% of total consumer revenues in Q3. We believe there is little doubt that the audio segment will continue its expeditious expansion. 
Bestsellers in Q3 included Shelby Van Pelt's novel, Remarkably Bright Creatures. While Savannah Guthrie's Mostly What God Does continues to thrive, as does Peter Schweizer's Blood Money and Fangirl Down by Tessa Bailey. Pope Francis' memoir, Life: My Story through History, which we published in 8 languages, is selling well and will surely have an enduring [people] presence in libraries. 
We anticipate a strong performance in Q4 with Lucy Foley's, The Midnight Feast; The War on Warriors by Pete Hegseth and Day Trading Attention by Gary Vaynerchuk.
At subscription video services, the Hubbl streaming aggregation product, launched in March, and we are working with our partners at Comcast to shepherd its adoption throughout Australia. The intent is to reduce churn by increasing engagement and improving the customer experience. Excluding ForEx fluctuations, adjusted segment EBITDA overall improved by 1% in the segment. 
Kayo is benefiting from the impact of a fascinating season of both Aussie Rules Football and Rugby League, and had its highest sequential quarterly net additions since inception, powered by both new customer growth and reactivations. We anticipate that recent price increases at Kayo and expected strong subscriber growth will continue to benefit the bottom line as both leading sports codes are drawing record audiences. 
Foxtel continued to grow its streaming revenues in Q3, which now account for 29% of circulation and subscription revenues, up from 26% last year, which is helping to drive overall margins, which rose from 14.3% and to 14.5%. 
In News Media, our brands continue to increase their digital penetration across the globe and we were vigilant on costs, which were 5% lower than a year earlier. We anticipate further significant savings as a result of our transition of TalkTV to focus on streaming and original video content for our established British brands. And we also expect tangible cost benefits following the regulatory approval for the joint printing agreement between News U.K. and the Daily Mail Group. 
The Times of London will expand digitally and gradually into the U.S. during Q4, inspired by the success of the U.S. Sun in reaching new audiences and enhancing digital revenues. Much journalism is unfortunately [joined us], but our imperative is for reporters to have the objective of being objective and for our economists to have the objective of being subjective. 
As of the end of March, The Times and Sunday Times closing digital subscribers, including The Times literary supplement, were at 582,000, up 5% year-over-year. Meanwhile, digital subscribers at News Corp Australia as of the end of March were over 1.1 million, up 7% compared to the prior year. 
In the first 3 quarters of fiscal year 2024, News Corp delivered strong profit growth, and we fervently believe that the company is firmly on a pathway to continued success. Our trusted premium intellectual property resonates in an era of polarization and amidst a rising tide of AI field falsehoods and fuss. For us, AI stands for authentic and authenticated intelligence, not artificial intelligence or the artifice of intelligence. 
As always, we remain sincerely grateful for the astute leadership of Lachlan and Rupert Murdoch, and for the sage support of our Board, investors and customers and for the sterling efforts of all of our employees. 
One final note. For more than a year, our colleague, Evan Gershkovich, has been falsely and cruelly imprisoned in Moscow. In public and not so public ways, we are actively seeking his release. We deeply appreciate those who have assisted the cause and we sincerely look forward to his emancipation. 
I now turn to Susan Panuccio for additional details of our performance in Q3.
Thank you, Robert, and good afternoon to everyone. As Robert highlighted, we remain focused on the execution of our strategy to transform News Corp with an increased mix of recurring and digital revenues as we continue to expand our information services businesses. This has been balanced with reinvestment in key growth initiatives and cost efficiencies as we navigate ongoing inflationary pressures in our markets.
Our third quarter total revenues were over $2.4 billion, down 1% compared to the prior year, while adjusted revenues were flat compared to the prior year. 
Total segment EBITDA was $322 million for the quarter, up 1% compared to the prior year on a reported and adjusted basis, and ranked as the second most profitable Q3 since the company's separation in 2013. 
For the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.05 compared to $0.09 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.11 in the quarter compared to $0.09 in the prior year. 
Moving on to the results of the individual segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were $388 million, up 7% versus the prior year and up 9% on an adjusted basis. Segment EBITDA was $104 million, up 2% as higher profit contribution from the REA Group was partly offset by lower revenues and approximately $11 million of higher costs at Move. Adjusted segment EBITDA grew 7%. 
REA had another very strong quarter with revenues rising 15% year-on-year on a reported basis to $256 million and up 20% in constant currency. Growth was again driven by a combination of residential yield increases and improved growth in national listings, favorable geographic mix and customer contract upgrades. 
New buyer listings rose approximately 6%, with Sydney up 20% and Melbourne up 18% despite an early Easter, which negatively impacted March volumes. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call for more details. 
Move's revenues of $132 million were down 6% compared to the prior year, with declines continuing to moderate from recent quarters. For the quarter, real estate revenues fell 5%, driven by lower referral and lead gen revenues, reflective of the broader industry trends and lower transaction volumes. 
We saw an improvement in lead volumes for the first time in over 2 years, growing 4% year-over-year, benefiting from product enhancements and some stabilization in the housing market. Average monthly unique users for the quarter were flat versus the prior year at 72 million, but improving 9% from the second quarter. 
As Robert mentioned, we announced a rentals partnership with Zillow to syndicate large multifamily rental listings, which went live May 1. The agreement, financially beneficial, allows us to materially expand and improve our rental content offerings and to reallocate investment to marketing and our core buy and sell-side offerings. 
As we communicated last quarter, we are focused on best positioning realtor.com for a housing recovery, and as a result, are increasing the rate of reinvestment in the second half of fiscal 2024. To reiterate, some of the key strategic focuses include modernizing the technology stack, ensuring we have the best content for our product offerings and leveraging News Corp's network to drive audience share. 
Damian has been very focal about the ongoing benefits of buyer agents. And while we will closely monitor the impact of the proposed NAR settlement, we continue to believe in the long-term opportunity for realtor.com and have not altered our strategic direction, which already includes diversifying revenues and expanding our seller offerings, which continue to scale. 
Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $455 million, down 5% compared to the prior year. On an adjusted basis, revenues were down 1% versus the prior year. Streaming revenues accounted for over 29% of circulation and subscription revenues versus 26% in the prior year. 
Total closing paid subscribers across the Foxtel Group were over 4.5 million at quarter end, down 1% from the prior year, but up 5% versus the second quarter as Foxtel transitions into the winter sports season. 
Total paid streaming subscribers were nearly 3.1 million, increasing 3% versus the prior year, benefiting from a strong start to the AFL and NRL seasons. 
Kayo added 269,000 paying subscribers this quarter, the highest sequential quarterly net addition since its launch in fiscal 2019, which is consistent with recent trends of customers returning post summer. 
Foxtel ended the quarter with over 1.2 million residential broadcast subscribers, down 9% year-over-year. Broadcast churn was 13.3% versus 12.3% in the prior year, while broadcast ARPU rose 2% to AUD 85 benefiting modestly from new pricing and packaging plans implemented in March. 
Segment EBITDA in the quarter of $66 million was down only 3% versus the prior year despite the inclusion of $13 million of costs related to Hubbl, which launched in early March, and a 4% negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Adjusted segment EBITDA increased 1%. 
Moving on to Dow Jones. Third quarter results were again strong at Dow Jones with revenues of $544 million, up 3% year-over-year with digital revenue accounting for 81% of total revenues this quarter, up 2 percentage points from last year. Circulation and subscription-based revenues represented 82% of total revenues, again, reinforcing the stability and recurring nature of the revenue base. 
We saw strong growth at PIB, with revenues rising 10% year-over-year, including a 15% growth at Risk & Compliance to $76 million and 15% growth at DJ Energy to $63 million. Total PIB retention rates remained strong at over 90%. 
Across the B2B portfolio this quarter, over 2/3 of the growth is coming from new customers, new products or upsells with the balance coming from annual price increases. At Dow Jones Energy, the mix between pricing and volume is more balanced this year due to the benefit of a pricing review, which led to above-average increases. 
Within the Dow Jones Consumer business, circulation revenues were flat versus the prior year, with digital-only subscription growth accelerating from the Q2 rate to 17% year-over-year and higher by 322,000 subscriptions sequentially, helped by increased penetration of the Dow Jones bundling offer as they look to better leverage subscription acquisition costs across multiple products, capitalize on minimal overlap between products and drive greater engagement. 
Bundling accounted for approximately 45% of the incremental digital only volume growth in Q3 and now represents about 14% of total subscriptions. We have taken price rises this quarter, increasing monthly rates by nearly 20% to a cohort of tenured print subscribers. 
Advertising revenues declined 2% to $86 million, with year-over-year declines moderating slightly from the first half with digital improving, up 4%, driven by a rebound in technology spend. WSJ.com grew 12%, underscoring the strength of the platform and its valuable audience. Print advertising declined 11% due to weakness in the financial sector. Digital represented 63% of advertising revenues, up from 59% last year. 
Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter grew 8% to $118 million and was again the largest segment EBITDA contributor across the company. Margins improved year-over-year by 110 basis points to 21.7%, driven by the strong B2B performance, which remains on track to be the largest contributor to Dow Jones profitability in fiscal 2024. 
Costs, as expected, rose modestly, partly due to the phasing of sales and marketing expenses as we mentioned last quarter. At Book Publishing, strong growth in our Christian business was not enough to offset some softness in our romance general books and children's divisions. Consumer softness and headwinds in the mass merchandiser accounts such as Costco and Walmart were greater than we expected in March. 
Revenues were $506 million, down 2%, but that compares with a record third quarter last year, while segment EBITDA improved 2% to $62 million compared to the prior year, largely due to the easing of supply chain pressures and the cost efficiencies driven by the HarperCollins team over the past 12 months. Margin improved slightly to over 12%. 
We continue to see improvements in supply chain-related costs with freight distribution and manufacturing costs all down versus the prior year. Return rates again improved compared to last year, while inventory levels appear to have normalized across our distribution network. The backlist contributed 63% of consumer revenues, up from 60% last year, while digital sales rose 5% this quarter, reaching 25% of consumer sales. Downloadable audio rose mid-teens helped by the recent Spotify partnership. 
Turning to News Media, performance continued to be challenged in the quarter with print advertising declines returning to more historic levels. Revenues were $530 million, down 6% versus the prior year, while adjusted revenues also declined 6%. 
Circulation and subscription revenues were flat and down 1% in constant currency as cover price increases and digital subscriber growth were offset by lower print volumes. 
Advertising remained challenging, down 13%, both on a reported basis and in local currency with print advertising trends notably weak across all markets. 
As our News Media businesses face ongoing print challenges, they continue to work hard on their transition to digital and ongoing cost efficiencies. Segment EBITDA of $26 million declined $8 million, which was due to the lower revenue, partly offset by lower print volume and newsprint expenses. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 26%. 
As for the outlook, similar to our comments last quarter, it is challenging to forecast in the short term, albeit economic indicators vary across markets. 
Looking at each of our segments, at Digital Real Estate Services, Australian residential new buy listings for April grew 32% due to the timing of Easter as well as easier comparisons to the prior year. Please refer to REA for a more specific outlook commentary. 
At Move, we hope to see continued moderation in revenue declines. Like the third quarter, we expect continued reinvestment in marketing and product development, which will be partially offset by cost reductions elsewhere and the new rental agreement with Zillow. 
In Subscription Video Services, consistent with our message last quarter, we continue to expect modestly higher expenses for the full year and some softness in streaming revenues due to the first half, which may impact full year profitability in local currency. 
At Dow Jones, while we continue to expect strong revenue and profitability performance for the full year, underpinned by our B2B offerings, we expect modestly higher overall expenses for the fourth quarter and full year. 
At Book Publishing, overall industry revenue trends appear relatively stable, albeit third quarter was a bit softer than the first half for physical sales, but we are encouraged by the strength in downloadable audio. We continue to expect margins to improve versus the prior year and expect strong performance in Q4, partly due to the prior year comparison. 
At News Media, advertising revenue trends remain challenging, particularly in Australia, and we will continue to focus on ongoing cost efficiencies in our digital product offerings. 
For the other segment, we expect costs for the fourth quarter to be in line with the previous 3 quarters. We now expect CapEx to be relatively stable to last year, slightly lower than our initial expectations. 
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A.
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Entcho Raykovski from Evans & Partners.
So my question is around the Move investment, which you've made during the quarter and you flagged is ongoing. It sounds like it's both marketing and product development. Are you able to confirm that? And how much is going into marketing? How much is going to product development? 
And on the product development side, are you specifically targeting the sell-side agents with that spend given the NAR settlements? If you can provide some more detail around the sort of products you're investing in? And just more broadly, how do you think that settlement is going to impact the business model going forward?
Entcho, look, obviously, I don't intend to comment on specific legal cases. And the U.S. real estate industry is clearly in transition. But there's no doubt that realtors have a crucial role in the purchasing process, and we are proud to serve them.
As for realtor.com, our experience in Australia and our complementary media platforms and U.S. position us perfectly to take advantage of that tradition, where transition. We are very focused in the interim of on making sure that the back end is solid, that the user interface is great and that our customers get value for money. 
We are very focused on buy-sell, hence our partnership deal with Zillow on rentals, which will be beneficial to both companies. And the imperative, really, is to focus on the world's largest property market, which is still relatively early in its digital evolution. And we have the media assets and now, from our global experience, to make the most of that moment.
And Entcho, maybe just to add on that, too. I mean the spend itself is probably broadly focused roughly evenly across both categories. But I think the thing to remember is in relation to the back half of last year, we pulled back significantly on the marketing spend, particularly in Q3 and a little bit in Q4. So the prior year compares will look more challenging in relation to marketing spend. But to think about it more broadly, it's focused on both areas, product and marketing.
Our next question comes from David Karnovsky from JPMorgan.
Maybe on Book Publishing. I wanted to see if you could speak a little more broadly to what you're seeing in terms of demand trends right now. You mentioned some softness at big box retailers. 
And then with Spotify, what potential tailwind do you see for streaming and widening kind of the overall market for audio books? And can you say if you've seen any incremental interest from other DSPs to carry HarperCollins content?
Well, as for HarperCollins, we are all bookish to a certain degree and purchases ebb and flow like the pilot books on the bedside table. 
Early last quarter, sales were strong, and then there was clearly a slight pause in purchasing. But what I can say is that we have seen a return to strong year-on-year performance in April and have a compelling roster of new releases. And even in Q3, we saw an improvement in margin from 11.8% last year to 12.3% this year. 
We're certainly benefiting from the international expansion of audio books, as you mentioned, and the efforts of Spotify, who have transformed audio book streaming revenue, which rose 14% in the third quarter. So we're proud to partner with Daniel Ek and his talented team as they roll out streaming globally.
And David, maybe just to complement that a little bit. It's not like a perfect comparison. The Book Scan data, when we have a look at it for Q3, showed consumption down 3%. So that gives you an indication that the market was a little bit softer for Q3. But going into Q4, we did have a particularly weak Q4 last year, so we would expect to see pretty strong compares as we finish out the year.
Our next question comes from Alan Gould from Loop Capital.
Question on the Google transaction. Can you flesh -- or this renewal, can you flesh this out a little bit? And remember, at one point last year, you talked about a 9-figure deal with the digital companies. I don't recall if that was just Google or others. And does this include generative AI in addition to using your journalism for other sources?
Look, I can't comment on the financial details of the deal other than to say that this is a renewal of the existing deal. It has nothing to do with a payment for AI, Gen AI use of our content, servicing of that content, training of that content or grounding of the content. So any negotiations for that particular use of our content will come later.
And Alan, just from a financial perspective, well, we've never given a doubt specifically, you can assume that it's broadly consistent with the financials of the previous deal.
Our next question comes from Craig Huber from Huber Research.
Yes, can you hear me okay?
Yes, Craig.
Yes. Just -- I think everybody is really curious just about the progress that you're trying to make here to transform the company, to simplify the company and stuff. And obviously, we talked about this 3 months ago and 6 months when you talked about it privately -- I mean publicly, I should say. And obviously, you've done a lot of work on this before you made the announcement 6 months ago. 
I'm just kind of curious, can you give investors at all any sort of timeline when you guys might wrap this up and stuff? I mean, obviously, things are pretty quiet out there for most of the investment banks and the legal folks after that work on this sort of stuff. 
So I know it's very complicated, what you guys are doing here, but what -- how much longer do you think we should have to wait with the next quarter or so? Or do you really have no idea?
Craig, I'm sure that you and all on the call are sage enough to pass the phrases used in my earlier explanation and define the potential meaning. You can see that we're well advanced now, thinking and planning and that planning has involved necessary regulatory steps, and those were not simple steps, to ensure that we have maximum flexibility, genuine optionality. 
We want to continue to generate momentum and create maximum value for our shareholders. And we're certainly not complacent. Even though the share price has risen as of yesterday, just over 46% in the past year, we do recognize that there is a significant sum of the parts discount, so stay tuned and not indefinitely.
Our next question comes from Darren Leung from Macquarie.
Just a quick one for me. Looking at the BINGE subscribers in Foxtel, they're down sequentially quarter-on-quarter. So the second time it has happened. But I'm just keen to understand a little bit about the drivers here and your response and thought process here, please?
Darren, I think when we think about it from the last quarter, I think we talked about this, there was the writer's strike towards the back end of last year, and that obviously had an impact on the content that was flowing through there. So that did have an impact on the subscribers, and we're seeing a carry forward of that. I mean, that's really what the impact is.
Our next question comes from Lucy Huang from UBS.
My question is in relation to cost out. I guess right now, the macro outlook still seems relatively uncertain, particularly for advertising and similar way with like the U.S. housing market. So just wondering if there's any script for some further cost reductions through the course of the next year if these conditions start to improve?
I think, Lucy, you might remember, we did -- we sort of announced, I think, probably a year ago, the 5% head count reduction. And I think we quoted a number of 160 million for the cost out. I mean it's great that we're actually -- we hit those numbers and exceeded those numbers actually. 
But the really good thing is that the businesses are actually always focused on costs. So whilst that was a particular exercise that we did across the whole group, across all our businesses, there are different transformation initiatives that they continue to work on as they look for efficiencies. 
So we feel pretty confident that we've got a good cadence in relation to that, that can help offset any shortfalls in revenue. And that's why you've seen such good margin expansion in the year.
Our next question comes from Brian Han from Morningstar.
Susan, just on that cost out question. So it looks like some sort of cost reduction initiatives will be ongoing in the current fourth quarter. But how much of that do you think will be reinvested in realtor.com?
We sort of -- we're trying to keep the balanced reinvestment within REALTOR itself. So I think I said in my prepared remarks, we've got some benefit from the upside in the new rental agreements that we've done with Zillow and we've got some other cost savings that we're doing with REALTOR. So whilst there is an increase in cost, we are trying to manage it there. 
I think when we sort of think more broadly about costs across the business, and sort of to the earlier point that we talked to with Lucy, we just constantly focus on looking for efficiency. So the U.K., we've announced a pivot in the TalkTV strategy to streaming, and that should unlock some savings, which we'll really see come through in fiscal 2025. The U.K. team have also announced a joint venture with the Daily Mail Group in relation to joint printing, that should unlock further savings. We know our Australian team are constantly iterating when it comes to savings. 
So we sort of -- we try and have to think about it broadly across the whole company, but specifically in the divisions that we look for those cost savings.
Our next question comes from Jamie Laskovski from Goldman Sachs.
I was just wondering if you could elaborate on the underlying company structure changes that have happened so far that were called out and what we should expect over the medium term?
Jamie, they were regulatory changes related to the original composition of the company in Australia. And really, other than what I said earlier, I'm not at the liberty to say anything more at this moment.
At this time, we have no further questions. I'll now hand back to you for closing remarks.
Thank you, Leila. Thank you all for participating. Have a wonderful day, and we will talk to you soon. Take care.

REA Group (ASX:REA) Is Reinvesting At Lower Rates Of Return

What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing 
 on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's 
 of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. Looking at 
 (
), it does have a high ROCE right now, but lets see how returns are trending.
If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for REA Group:
0.26 = AU$622m ÷ (AU$2.7b - AU$321m) 
.
So, 
 In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Interactive Media and Services industry average of 8.0%.
In the above chart we have measured REA Group's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can 
 for 
On the surface, the trend of ROCE at REA Group doesn't inspire confidence. Historically returns on capital were even higher at 41%, but they have dropped over the last five years. On the other hand, the company has been employing more capital without a corresponding improvement in sales in the last year, which could suggest these investments are longer term plays. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.
On a side note, REA Group has done well to pay down its current liabilities to 12% of total assets. That could partly explain why the ROCE has dropped. Effectively this means their suppliers or short-term creditors are funding less of the business, which reduces some elements of risk. Some would claim this reduces the business' efficiency at generating ROCE since it is now funding more of the operations with its own money.
In summary, REA Group is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. Yet to long term shareholders the stock has gifted them an incredible 111% return in the last five years, so the market appears to be rosy about its future. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.

Investing in REA Group (ASX:REA) five years ago would have delivered you a 109% gain

Stock pickers are generally looking for stocks that will outperform the broader market. Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. To wit, the REA Group share price has climbed 98% in five years, easily topping the market return of 21% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 36%, including dividends.
So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.
In his essay 
 Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.
Over half a decade, REA Group managed to grow its earnings per share at 18% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 15% over the same period. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days. Having said that, the market is still optimistic, given the P/E ratio of 85.87.
The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).

 interactive report on REA Group's 
 is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.
When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between 
 (TSR) and 
. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for REA Group the TSR over the last 5 years was 109%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the 
 shareholder return.
We're pleased to report that REA Group shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 36% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 16% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified
