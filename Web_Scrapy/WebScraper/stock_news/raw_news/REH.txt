We Ran A Stock Scan For Earnings Growth And Reece (ASX:REH) Passed With Ease

For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.
So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like 
 (
). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it.
If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Reece managed to grow EPS by 17% per year, over three years. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.
Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Reece maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 25% to AU$8.5b. That's a real positive.

Of course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to 
.
Since Reece has a market capitalisation of AU$13b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth AU$1.7b. That equates to 13% of the company, making insiders powerful and aligned with other shareholders. Looking very optimistic for investors.
One positive for Reece is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. To add an extra spark to the fire, significant insider ownership in the company is another highlight. That combination is very appealing. So yes, we do think the stock is worth keeping an eye on. While we've looked at the quality of the earnings, we haven't yet done any work to value the stock. So if you like to buy cheap, you may want to

The Returns On Capital At Reece (ASX:REH) Don't Inspire Confidence

If we want to find a potential multi-bagger, often there are underlying trends that can provide clues. Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing 
 on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing 
 of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Having said that, from a first glance at 
 (
) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.
If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Reece, this is the formula:
0.12 = AU$679m รท (AU$6.9b - AU$1.4b) 
.
Thus, 
 That's a relatively normal return on capital, and it's around the 11% generated by the Trade Distributors industry.
In the above chart we have measured Reece's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our 
 
.
In terms of Reece's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 12% from 17% five years ago. However, given capital employed and revenue have both increased it appears that the business is currently pursuing growth, at the consequence of short term returns. If these investments prove successful, this can bode very well for long term stock performance.
In summary, despite lower returns in the short term, we're encouraged to see that Reece is reinvesting for growth and has higher sales as a result. And the stock has followed suit returning a meaningful 80% to shareholders over the last five years. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we would look further into this stock to make sure the other metrics justify the positive view.
While Reece doesn't shine too bright in this respect, it's still worth seeing if the company is trading at attractive prices. You can find that out with our

Reece's (ASX:REH) investors will be pleased with their respectable 80% return over the last five years

Generally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, long term 
 (
) shareholders have enjoyed a 68% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 13% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 23% in the last year , including dividends .
Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.
To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.
During five years of share price growth, Reece achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 6.1% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 11% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.
The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).
It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our

It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Reece the TSR over the last 5 years was 80%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!
It's nice to see that Reece shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 23% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 12% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time.

Reece Limited (ASX:REH) Shares Could Be 22% Above Their Intrinsic Value Estimate

Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Reece Limited (
) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.
Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the 
 may be something of interest to you.
We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:
 = AU$3.6b
After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.6%.
= FCF
 ร (1 + g) รท (r โ g) = AU$711mร (1 + 2.0%) รท (7.6%โ 2.0%) = AU$13b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$13bรท ( 1 + 7.6%)
= AU$6.3b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is AU$9.9b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of AU$18.6, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.
The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Reece as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.114. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to "what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price exceeding the intrinsic value? For Reece, we've compiled three essential aspects you should explore:

Reece Insider Ups Holding During Year

Looking at 
 (
) insider transactions over the last year, we can see that insiders were net buyers. That is, there were more number of shares purchased by insiders than there were sold.
Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.
Notably, that recent purchase by Leslie Wilson is the biggest insider purchase of Reece shares that we've seen in the last year. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of AU$18.80. Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important. Generally speaking, it catches our eye when an insider has purchased shares at above current prices, as it suggests they believed the shares were worth buying, even at a higher price. Leslie Wilson was the only individual insider to buy during the last year.
The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!
Reece is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find 
 this 
 
Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Reece insiders own 13% of the company, worth about AU$1.6b. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.
The recent insider purchase is heartening. And an analysis of the transactions over the last year also gives us confidence. Once you factor in the high insider ownership, it certainly seems like insiders are positive about Reece. Nice! If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this

Could The Market Be Wrong About Reece Limited (ASX:REH) Given Its Attractive Financial Prospects?

With its stock down 6.2% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard Reece (ASX:REH). But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. Particularly, we will be paying attention to 
 ROE today.
Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) รท Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Reece is:
11% = AU$388m รท AU$3.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).
The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each A$1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made A$0.11 in profit.
We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or "retains", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a companyโs earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.
To begin with, Reece seems to have a respectable ROE. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 9.5%. Consequently, this likely laid the ground for the decent growth of 17% seen over the past five years by Reece.
Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Reece's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 26% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see.
Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is Reece fairly valued compared to other companies? These 
 might help you decide.
With a three-year median payout ratio of 37% (implying that the company retains 63% of its profits), it seems that Reece is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees respectable amount growth in its earnings and pays a dividend that's well covered.
Moreover, Reece is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 41%. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that Reece's future ROE will be 10% which is again, similar to the current ROE.
On the whole, we feel that Reece's performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. As a result, the decent growth in its earnings is not surprising. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

Reece Limited's (ASX:REH) biggest owners are private companies who got richer after stock soared 4.3% last week

A look at the shareholders of Reece Limited (
) can tell us which group is most powerful. With 56% stake, private companies possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).
Clearly, private companies benefitted the most after the company's market cap rose by AU$543m last week.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Reece.
Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.
We can see that Reece does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Reece, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.
Reece is not owned by hedge funds. L.T. Wilson Pty Ltd. is currently the largest shareholder, with 24% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 9.3% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 7.5% by the third-largest shareholder.
Our research also brought to light the fact that roughly 55% of the company is controlled by the top 5 shareholders suggesting that these owners wield significant influence on the business.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.
Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.
It seems insiders own a significant proportion of Reece Limited. It has a market capitalization of just AU$13b, and insiders have AU$1.7b worth of shares in their own names. That's quite significant. It is good to see this level of investment. You can 
The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 17% stake in Reece. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.
It seems that Private Companies own 56%, of the Reece stock. It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company.
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

Reece Kurtenbach; CEO; Daktronics, Inc.
Sheila Anderson; CFO; Daktronics, Inc.
BJ Cook; Analyst; Singular Research
Anja Soderstrom; Analyst; Sidoti & Company, LLC

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, February 28, 2024, and is available on the company's website at www.daktronics.com. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Carla Gatzke, Corporate Secretary for Daktronics, for some introductory remarks. Please go ahead, Carla.
Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for participating in our third quarter earnings conference call. I would like to review our disclosure, cautioning investors and participants that in addition to statements of historical fact, we will be discussing forward-looking statements reflecting our expectations and plans about the future, our future financial performance and future business opportunities. These forward-looking statements reflect the company's expectations or beliefs concerning future events. All forward-looking statements involve risk and opportunities that could cause actual results to differ materially to differ materially from our expectations. Such risks include, but are not limited to changes in economic and market conditions, management of growth, timing and magnitude of future contracts and orders, fluctuations and margins, the introduction of new products and technology availability of raw materials components and shipping services and other important factors. These identified factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in this call.
In the company's 2024 quarterly earnings release and in its most recent annual report on Form 10-K. I second quarterly 2024 earnings release contains certain non GAAP financial measures and was furnished to the SEC on a Form eight K this morning, clarify Third Quarter 2024 earnings release. We also made slides available for today's call. All of these documents are available on the Investors section at Daktronics website, www.daktronics.com.
I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Reece Kurtenbach.
Thank you, Carla. Good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us today. Our third quarter and year to date results reflect our team's strong execution of our strategies across all our business areas. These strategies have raised the bar for execution and expectations of profitability in our operating model. As a result, we have delivered record sales and operating income to date in fiscal 2024 and drove robust operating cash generation in the third quarter. These results serve as evidence of the success of our past decisive and deliberate actions taken to adapt to challenging business conditions and to improve our customers' experience while increasing our profitability and working capital levels. Results also testify to the resiliency and strength of our teams within Daktronics and to our strategy of capturing demand in diversified markets and innovating across technology platforms.
If you have opened the slide deck, I invite you to turn to slide 3 titled fiscal third quarter 2024 highlights and to follow the financial outcomes for the quarter. To put our fiscal 2024 results delivery into perspective, our third quarter is historically a seasonally low volume quarter for revenue, and therefore, historically could result in a breakeven or even a loss-making quarter. However, reflecting back to fiscal 2023, third quarter, we fulfilled back ordered work as we had new designs available to take advantage of the available parts in our supply chains and as other supply chain-related pressures were resolving.
This resulted in extraordinarily high volume and high profit for the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, a unique time for us during this fiscal year's third quarter, despite a return to more traditional seasonality and fulfilling a lower volume volume of orders as compared to last year's surge. We drove an $8 million profit operating profit and generated $9 million in operating cash flow.
During fiscal Q3, we experienced robust order volume of 192 million live events and the Commercial Business Unit orders strengthened in the quarter and all domestic markets saw growth. Third quarter orders grew 29% more than last year's third quarter, bringing year to date order growth to 6.6% for the year. These increases reflect our focus on profitable order generation and our serviceable address available markets or SAM backlog continues to decrease from last year's built-up levels as we recognize the anniversary of the resolution of supply chain challenges and utilize our capacity to deliver customer orders at market expected lead times.
With respect to sourcing, our revamped and more diversified supply chains are functioning well across our suppliers. As we primarily compete with companies that obtain their products from China and compete on price, we've continued to evaluate our price position in the market and are adjusting our prices to achieve our order attainment goals at profitable levels. Given our results to date this year and the momentum in our order flow, we feel good about our positioning to drive profitable growth and cash flow generation into the fourth quarter and beyond.
For additional details on the financial results for the quarter, I'll now turn it over to Sheila.
Thank you, Reece. Please turn your attention to slide 4, titled, SQ3 FY 2024 financial highlights, for the quarterly overview. Orders for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 increased by 29.4% from the third quarter of fiscal 2023 through strong demand in the live events business unit, returning demand in the spectacular and out of home markets in our Commercial Business Unit and solid growth in High School Park and Recreation and transportation business units. These higher orders offset the decline in the international business units orders as compared to last year. Third quarter, we believe international demand softness relates to the economic and geopolitical geo political conditions. We generated sales of $170 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. As compared to $185 million of sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. This 7.9% sales volume declined as the industry is returning to more traditional seasonal trends. And because during last year's back half of the second quarter and during the third quarter, the supply chain stabilization allowed us to physically finish a high volume of orders and deliver for revenue recognition in those quarters.
As Reece highlighted, the third quarter is our historically low sales volume quarter because of sports seasonality, outdoor construction malls in the winter months and fewer workdays due to the holiday breaks. This year's third quarter volume was as expected. Supply chains also continued to flow generally as expected, gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 24.5% for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 as compared to 22.6% in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The 190 basis point increase in gross profit percentage is attributable to strategic pricing actions and stability in our diversified supply chain.
Operating margin was 4.7% of sales during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 as compared to last year's 3.8% or adjusted 6.3% without the noncash goodwill impairment charge recorded in last year's quarter three fiscal 2020 for third quarter's positive operating margin rate is attributable to our continued careful management of operating expenses again, it's notable that we delivered an $8 million Third Quarter Fiscal 2020 for operating profit in our seasonally lowest volume quarter of the year.
Please turn to slide. As a highlight year to date, performance orders for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 increased by 6.6% as compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023 through strong demand in live events, transportation and High School Park and Recreation business units. Commercial orders are down for the nine months from last year due to a large to a due to a lack of large project bookings and a reduction in order spend by the Out of Home segment customers in the first six months of the year, partially offset by the third quarter improvement in order placements. International also was down slightly on a nine month basis. Sales grew 10.6% for the first nine months which aligns to the order volume and built-up backlog coming into the first part of the fiscal year.
Gross margin as a percent of net sales increased to 27.7% for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 as compared to 18.2% in the first nine months of fiscal 2023. The 950 basis points increase in gross profit percentage is attributable to our strategic pricing actions, our investments in factory automation, our focus on cost effective and high-quality product designs and the stability of our diversified supply chain after investments and operational areas and organic growth. The resulting operating margin was 11.2% of sales during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 as compared to last year's 0.6% or 1.4% at that goodwill impairment was repeat removed from the calculation of non-GAAP calculation, but helpful to compare the improvements.
The balance sheet -- from a balance sheet perspective, our cash position net of debt increased due to cash generation from the profitable quarter and management of working capital. Cash net of debt was $27.2 million, and we generated $53.8 million of operating cash flow during the first nine months because of our profitability and our ability to lower investments in inventory levels from the height of the supply chain challenges. Our working capital ratio at quarter end was 2.2 compared to 1.6 at the same time last year.
For an update on the market verticals, I'll turn it back over to you, Reece.
Thank you, Sheila. Please reference slide 6 titled, market verticals update. Our mission is to support our customers to inform, entertain and persuade their audiences and their customers.
Let us look more specifically into our business areas. In live events. We again, partnered with the Detroit Tigers to deliver the second largest main video display in baseball's, major leagues at Comerica Park, updating and upgrading our previous installation from 2012 five additional displays will be installed along the fascia dugout and line score locations ahead of the 2024 baseball season.
Moving forward, we expect live events demand to remain strong as there are a number of projects being bid as venues, enhanced facilities to entertain fans and attract athletes. We see this trend continuing and more focus being placed on entertainment areas and the experience outside the bowl in places like entry ways, atriums, concourses and adjacent entertainment areas. Commercial orders, especially from customers in the out-of-home advertising space can be sensitive to economic conditions and they can rebound quickly as conditions improve.
This market is also sensitive to the large national advertisers spending decisions, which is why we also focus on winning other independent billboard sales. We saw a nice order rebound in Q three and both national and local out-of-home customers. However, large national out-of-home companies are noting plans to continue to constrain spending in the coming calendar year. We continue to innovate and provide competitive differentiation in the marketplace to reach the needs of our customers. For example, we are seeing interest in our light direct digital billboards, light direct narrows the viewing cone of the display preventing light emissions from spilling into surrounding areas and targeting only the intended audience in urban and rural environments.
We continue to build out our AV integrator network to market our narrow pixel product lines, especially in control room applications used by military utility and transportation agencies, transportation. Our teams are focused in winning projects for intelligent transportation systems, as highlighted by fiscal Q. three wins and on projects in Arkansas and Tennessee International. During the quarter, we won a stadium project and orders for transportation areas yet orders have been slow this year, which we believe is due to economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Customers continue to demonstrate interest in projects but are delaying buying decisions.
Our sales teams continue to be responsive to customers and are actively quoting opportunities in high schools. The trend going forward continues to be conversion to full video. We are well positioned to meet this demand and believe we are in the early stages of this transition. We are looking to speed up and simplify the sales processes and increased our market reach process by deploying sales strategies. To make certain items available to be purchased online. We also continue to develop our sales channel and these efforts are going well. We are continuing to offer more products through these online and partner channels and have improved processes to make the buying process more efficient.
From a big picture perspective, our customers use our control capabilities to create, manage and schedule content for engagement with fans and audiences. We continue to make progress on our multiyear strategy to create more capabilities to aid in the service and maintenance of our systems as well as continually add to the feature set of our cloud-based and locally hosted systems. These capabilities are increasingly offered through software as a service, and we are investing in people and capabilities to grow these higher margin opportunities.
If you would focus on slide 7, titled strategic focus. Overall, our target markets are large and growing with resilient demand, driven by our customers' desire to improve their audience experience in sports, commercial and transportation environments. More specifically, we are focused on profitable growth by capturing more of our serviceable available market or SAM by expanding the share of customer spend, adding new customers, developing control options and expanding the services we offer driving increases in monthly recurring revenues. For example, we are offering frameworks a content design platform that enables students and staff the ability to access top-level content to elevate their brand for event production and promotions.
We're also working to capture new ways to use in-demand project products such as expanding applications using our indoor narrow pixel pitch product, which are applicable across all our businesses. For example, we sold additional concourse displays from our MPP. product line to the Green Bay Packers, Atlanta Field and existing customer using our traditional products internationally, we are driving live events, commercial and transportation opportunities as the economic conditions continue to improve and we are focused on developing and marketing to the military by attending tradeshows specific to the industry and growing relationships with AV integrators focused on this market.
As we grow revenues, we are working to further increase our nimbleness and flexibility in capacity allocation and utilization. We are investing over the coming fiscal years and improvements in our demand planning tools and alignment to capacity for integrated business planning and are expanding factory qualifications to have flexibility for where a product is built to maximize the use of our infrastructure and dynamically aligning capacity to adjust to seasonality and varying order flow by market.
Turning to slide 8 and slide nine, we are we appreciate the feedback and questions that we received from our shareholders and wanted to take this opportunity to address some of the questions most frequently asked. First, we are often asked why we don't give guidance today. As you know, our demand is project driven and therefore, can be lumpy. Demand is also highly seasonal. And additionally, demand can be impacted by customers and construction site schedules all making it difficult to give precise estimates for the future.
What we can say today is that over the next three to five years, we are working to drive sales growth with our sights on $1 billion of annual revenue and operating margin sustainability in the mid to upper end of the 5% to 10% range. As we move forward, we are investing in processes and systems to increase our level of control over the controllable elements of our business. This work is expected to increase our ability to be responsive to changing conditions as we grow in an increasingly complex global marketplace. By taking these actions. Our goal is to raise our visibility in, as I mentioned, a lumpy seasonal business and enhance our internal planning capabilities. It is important to note we but as we look more on an annual perspective in order to identify prevailing trends in our businesses and plan accordingly, while maintaining as much flexibility as possible. We will continue to reevaluate our guidance practices over time to help our investors understand our outlook.
Investors also ask what is our capital capital allocation strategy. We historically planned around 5% of sales in research and development expenses and roughly 3% of sales on average in capital spending to maintain our technology leadership, manage and maintain our manufacturing capacity information system and infrastructure and sales demonstration equipment. We also look for opportunistic acquisitions that can help us advance our technologies, penetrate new geographies or help expand our serviceable addressable market going forward as we increase our sustainability and cash flow generation we could consider repayment of our debt, and we may also consider the resumption of quarterly dividends and or share repurchases.
Turning to slide 9. Finally, we want to reiterate that our Board has aligned management compensation structure with investors' priorities for profitable growth. Specifically, the incentive compensation program is based on operating income as our key metric with targets of 10%. The strategies we described previously are designed to help us move towards that achievement, capturing profitable SAM, developing best-in-class solutions and managing expenses, maximizing our utilization and increasingly increasing the agility of our manufacturing capacity and automation through our systems and processes, our keys to managing expenses.
Turning to fiscal Q4 2024 qualitative outlook, I'd encourage you to reference slide 10. Given what we see in our businesses today, we anticipate our fiscal fourth quarter seasonality to be similar to pre-pandemic patterns, which is historically an increase in revenue and profitability as compared to the third quarter. While we are not offering a quantitative outlook, qualitatively, we look for fiscal 2020 for fourth quarter net sales to increase sequentially and decrease from the year ago. Period, which was again a high-volume period in which we were fulfilling back orders related to the pandemic recovery.
We are positioned for continued sequential Martin margin and cash flow generation in conclusion, our summary on Slide 11 recaps our key highlights. Our year-to-date results offer evidence that we have overcome the challenges caused by the constrained supply chain and pandemic implications of recent years, we enjoy our position as a global industry leader in best in class video communication systems.
We are the technology leader in our industry and are the only US manufacturer of scale with a global footprint. What differentiates us from our competitors is our US base, our technology leadership, the high quality of our solutions, our high touch service and our large entrenched customer base. Our target markets are large and growing with resilient demand, driven by audience experience, sports fan engagement and customer success with our systems, we are focused on a multiyear journey to capture the growth in existing SAM and in other areas. This places us for sustainable revenue, earnings and cash flows. We are very proud of our results and grateful to our teams who work together to deliver them, and we look forward to a solid end to the year.
With that, I would ask the operator to please open the line for questions.
(Operator Instructions) BJ Cook, Singular Research.
Yes, thanks for taking my question, guys. On new order growth was quite a bright spot for the quarter. Interestingly, last quarter there were higher orders in international and transportation and a decrease in commercial this quarter was quite the opposite. I know your results can kind of be choppy, but is there anything unique that you're seeing in those segments, given the jump in in new orders?
Bj, for Phil, I appreciate the question and thanks for joining us this morning. And I think what you're seeing is as we described here, lumpiness. We believe international and transportation tends to be large order based and that order books in a certain period and then it fulfills in subsequent periods. And so I think what you're seeing is a normal kind of impact of our business, which is why we tend to look over our larger periods to kind of smooths some of that out.
Great. Thanks. You guys mentioned in your remarks some new sources of revenues and SaaS, recurring revenue and military as well. Can you expand on those or how far along in the sales process are you are those different opportunities?
Certainly, our -- what we call our narrow pixel pitch product has really matured into a nice of a line of different pixel pitches and different ways that our customers can use them. And the other AV integrator own reseller chain that we sell. A lot of that through, continues to grow and be developed some of, but there's still room to continue to add AV integrators and build our visibility in that market space on the software as a system and some of these other content services. We see great potential in those areas. But relatively new, we're adding customers in those areas, but really in the past 12 to 18 months that has started.
Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.
Thanks, BJ.
Anja Soderstrom, Sidoti.
Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on the good progress here. I'm just curious the backlog declining, understand that's due to a catch-up from last year as to type two, but when do you think that will revert to seeing growth again?
Our backlog is going to fluctuate from quarter to quarter, Anja, as of as we book these large orders and then kind of work them off. We believe, though that are a year ago, our backlog was too large. We had a lot of project in there and we weren't able to meet market lead times. And so we see the reduction year-over-year in backlog as a positive as we've as we've got our delivery more into market lead times of what I would also say that as we talked about seasonality, our fiscal Q1 and Q2 tend to be our largest revenue quarters. And so we would expect backlog to grow somewhat as we go into that period and then shrink as we go into Q three and then grow again as we would come back into the next fiscal year as we've just over experience at seasonality in and out. Is that helpful, Anja?
Yes, that was helpful. Thank you. And then in terms of the gross margin fluctuating quite a bit as well, what is a sensible one to use going forward for forward projections?
Revenue growth is the -- gross profit --
The gross margins.
Gross margins, again, I think we're going to see a stabilization in our gross margins as the business environment just isn't as volatile as it was a year or so ago. Where does that all settle out is a good question. And yes, we believe that we certainly are enjoying these gross margins and we're very sensitive to pricing adjustments and cost increases, and we're fighting to hold those gross margins quarter-after-quarter. As far as guidance on what gross margins would or could be, I don't think we're ready to give that at this time.
Okay. Thank you. That was all for me.
Thank you, Anja.
(Operator Instructions) And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Reece for any closing remarks.
Thank you, Kevin. I'd like to thank everyone for attending our conference call today. I would like to let you know that we are appearing at the Sidoti Small-Cap Conference in March, and we often have one-on-ones following the conference call. We'll host the next earnings call likely in June as we release our annual results. I hope you all have a great day and a great week, and thanks again for joining us.
Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.

Earnings Beat: Reece Limited Just Beat Analyst Forecasts, And Analysts Have Been Updating Their Models

 (
) just released its half-yearly report and things are looking bullish. Reece beat earnings, with revenues hitting AU$4.5b, ahead of expectations, and statutory earnings per share outperforming analyst reckonings by a solid 20%. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year.
Following last week's earnings report, Reece's eleven analysts are forecasting 2024 revenues to be AU$8.91b, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are expected to decrease 5.5% to AU$0.62 in the same period. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of AU$8.74b and earnings per share (EPS) of AU$0.55 in 2024. So it seems there's been a definite increase in optimism about Reece's future following the latest results, with a solid gain to the earnings per share forecasts in particular.
It will come as no surprise to learn that the analysts have increased their price target for Reece 17% to AU$17.97on the back of these upgrades. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. The most optimistic Reece analyst has a price target of AU$23.95 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at AU$13.50. These price targets show that analysts do have some differing views on the business, but the estimates do not vary enough to suggest to us that some are betting on wild success or utter failure.
These estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the Reece's past performance and to peers in the same 
. These estimates imply that revenue is expected to slow, with a forecast annualised decline of 0.8% by the end of 2024. This indicates a significant reduction from annual growth of 13% over the last five years. Compare this with our data, which suggests that other companies in the same industry are, in aggregate, expected to see their revenue grow 5.1% per year. So although its revenues are forecast to shrink, this cloud does not come with a silver lining - Reece is expected to lag the wider industry.
The biggest takeaway for us is the consensus earnings per share upgrade, which suggests a clear improvement in sentiment around Reece's earnings potential next year. Fortunately, they also upgraded their revenue estimates, although our data indicates it is expected to perform worse than the wider industry. There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving.
With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. We have forecasts for Reece going out to 2026, and you can

Reece (ASX:REH) Will Want To Turn Around Its Return Trends

To find a multi-bagger stock, what are the underlying trends we should look for in a business? Firstly, we'll want to see a proven 
 on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding 
 of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think 
 (
) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.
Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Reece is:
0.12 = AU$679m รท (AU$6.9b - AU$1.4b) 
.
Thus, 
 In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Trade Distributors industry average of 11%.
In the above chart we have measured Reece's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Reece 
 for 
When we looked at the ROCE trend at Reece, we didn't gain much confidence. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 12% from 17% five years ago. Although, given both revenue and the amount of assets employed in the business have increased, it could suggest the company is investing in growth, and the extra capital has led to a short-term reduction in ROCE. And if the increased capital generates additional returns, the business, and thus shareholders, will benefit in the long run.
In summary, despite lower returns in the short term, we're encouraged to see that Reece is reinvesting for growth and has higher sales as a result. And long term investors must be optimistic going forward because the stock has returned a huge 141% to shareholders in the last five years. So while the underlying trends could already be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.
While Reece doesn't shine too bright in this respect, it's still worth seeing if the company is trading at attractive prices. You can find that out with our

Why Reece Limited (ASX:REH) Could Be Worth Watching

Reece Limited (
) led the ASX gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. The recent jump in the share price has meant that the company is trading at close to its 52-week high. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stockโs share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Letโs take a look at Reeceโs outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.
Reece appears to be expensive according to our price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average. In this instance, weโve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stockโs cash flows. We find that Reeceโs ratio of 42.89x is above its peer average of 24.98x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Trade Distributors industry. In addition to this, it seems like Reeceโs share price is quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to fall back down to an attractive buying range, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.
Future outlook is an important aspect when youโre looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so letโs also take a look at the company's future expectations. Reece's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 25%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.
 It seems like the market has well and truly priced in REHโs positive outlook, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question โ is now the right time to sell? If you believe REH should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.
 If youโve been keeping an eye on REH for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for REH, which means itโs worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.
Since timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are. At Simply Wall St, we have the analysts estimates which

Those who invested in Reece (ASX:REH) five years ago are up 194%

The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. Long term 
 (
) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 174% in five years. It's also good to see the share price up 25% over the last quarter.
Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns.
To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.
Over half a decade, Reece managed to grow its earnings per share at 12% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 22% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.
You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).
We like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our 
 
.
When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between 
 (TSR) and 
. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Reece the TSR over the last 5 years was 194%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!
We're pleased to report that Reece shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 68% over one year. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 24% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. If you want to research this stock further, the data on insider buying is an obvious place to start. You can

Private companies account for 56% of Reece Limited's (ASX:REH) ownership, while individual investors account for 16%

To get a sense of who is truly in control of Reece Limited (
), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are private companies with 56% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).
Individual investors, on the other hand, account for 16% of the company's stockholders.
Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Reece, beginning with the chart below.
Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.
Reece already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Reece's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.
Hedge funds don't have many shares in Reece. The company's largest shareholder is L.T. Wilson Pty Ltd., with ownership of 24%. L.T.W. Holdings Pty. Ltd. is the second largest shareholder owning 9.3% of common stock, and Warramunda Investments Pty. Ltd. holds about 7.5% of the company stock.
On looking further, we found that 55% of the shares are owned by the top 5 shareholders. In other words, these shareholders have a meaningful say in the decisions of the company.
Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
Our most recent data indicates that insiders own a reasonable proportion of Reece Limited. It is very interesting to see that insiders have a meaningful AU$2.1b stake in this AU$16b business. It is good to see this level of investment. You can 
The general public-- including retail investors -- own 16% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.
It seems that Private Companies own 56%, of the Reece stock. It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company.
It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Reece better, we need to consider many other factors.

Is Reece Limited's (ASX:REH) Latest Stock Performance A Reflection Of Its Financial Health?

Most readers would already be aware that Reece's (ASX:REH) stock increased significantly by 26% over the past three months. Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to 
 ROE today.
ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) รท Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Reece is:
12% = AU$425m รท AU$3.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).
The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every A$1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated A$0.12 in profit.
Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or "retains", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a companyโs earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.
At first glance, Reece seems to have a decent ROE. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 12%. Consequently, this likely laid the ground for the decent growth of 17% seen over the past five years by Reece.
We then compared Reece's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 27% in the same 5-year period, which is a bit concerning.
The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about Reece's's valuation, check out 
, as compared to its industry.
Reece has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 38% (or a retention ratio of 62%) and a respectable amount of growth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making efficient use of its profits.
Moreover, Reece is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 40%. As a result, Reece's ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 11% for future ROE.
In total, we are pretty happy with Reece's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. As a result, the decent growth in its earnings is not surprising. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

Bullish Reece Insiders Loaded Up On AU$18.9m Of Stock

Over the last year, a good number of insiders have significantly increased their holdings in 
 (
). This is encouraging because it indicates that insiders are more optimistic about the company's prospects.
Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.
The Executive Director Leslie Wilson made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for AU$19m worth of shares at a price of AU$18.83 each. We do like to see buying, but this purchase was made at well below the current price of AU$27.41. While it does suggest insiders consider the stock undervalued at lower prices, this transaction doesn't tell us much about what they think of current prices.
Reece insiders may have bought shares in the last year, but they didn't sell any. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!
Reece is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find 
 this 
 
Over the last three months, we've seen a bit of insider buying at Reece. Independent Non-Executive Director Karen Lee Penrose purchased AU$30k worth of shares in that period. We like it when there are only buyers, and no sellers. But in this case the amount purchased means the recent transaction may not be very meaningful on its own.
Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Reece insiders own about AU$2.3b worth of shares (which is 13% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.
Insider purchases may have been minimal, in the last three months, but there was no selling at all. That said, the purchases were not large. But insiders have shown more of an appetite for the stock, over the last year. Judging from their transactions, and high insider ownership, Reece insiders feel good about the company's future. Therefore, you should definitely take a look at this

Are Reece Limited (ASX:REH) Investors Paying Above The Intrinsic Value?

Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Reece Limited (
) as an investment opportunity by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.
Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the 
.
We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:
 = AU$4.6b
We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.3%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.2%.
= FCF
 ร (1 + g) รท (r โ g) = AU$762mร (1 + 2.3%) รท (7.2%โ 2.3%) = AU$16b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$16bรท ( 1 + 7.2%)
= AU$7.8b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is AU$12b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of AU$25.6, the company appears potentially overvalued at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.
Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Reece as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.079. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price exceeding the intrinsic value? For Reece, there are three important factors you should further research:

Reece (ASX:REH) Is Experiencing Growth In Returns On Capital

There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. Firstly, we'll want to see a proven 
 on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding 
 of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in 
 (
) returns on capital, so let's have a look.
If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Reece is:
0.13 = AU$691m รท (AU$6.7b - AU$1.3b) 
.
Therefore, 
 By itself that's a normal return on capital and it's in line with the industry's average returns of 13%.
In the above chart we have measured Reece's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our

The trends we've noticed at Reece are quite reassuring. Over the last five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 13%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 51%. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Reece thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.
A company that is growing its returns on capital and can consistently reinvest in itself is a highly sought after trait, and that's what Reece has. Since the stock has returned a staggering 172% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.
Before jumping to any conclusions though, we need to know what value we're getting for the current share price. That's where you can check out our
