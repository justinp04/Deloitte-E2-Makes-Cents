Valuation stumbling block for some bidders

NAIROBI/LONDON, Sept 5 (Reuters) -
At least three South African miners are in the running to buy Botswana's Khoemacau copper mine that is home to one of Africa's largest copper deposits, several sources told Reuters, as growing demand for the metal ensures strong competition for the sought-after asset.
Johannesburg-listed Impala Platinum, Exxaro Resources and Sibanye Stillwater are weighing bids for the copper and silver mine in Botswana, said the sources with knowledge of the matter, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the information.
A number of unnamed Chinese investors, are also on the list of companies interested in Khoemacau Copper Mining operations, one of the sources said.
Impala declined to comment. Exxaro did not immediately respond to emailed questions. Sibanye confirmed its interest.
"We are looking all the time for opportunities and Khoemacau came up on our radar and we have entered into an non-disclosure agreement to try and understand the opportunity better," Sibanye spokesperson James Wellsted told Reuters. "But Khoemacau is a bit more competitive and we are not going to enter into a bidding war that ends up not creating value."
An increase in copper demand for applications from solar panels to electric cars in coming years has prompted miners to scramble for more supplies of the metal.
Copper prices have fallen due to fears of a global slowdown, but longer-term prospects for the metal and a competitive bidding process will make it hard for any of the bidders to strike a bargain, two of the sources said.
Khoemacau's owners - Cupric Canyon LP, a U.S. private equity firm with funds managed by Global Natural Resources Investments (GNRI) and Resource Capital Fund VII LP - said in May they had begun to engage with potential buyers.
The process is expected to take several months and be finalised close to the end of 2023, a Khoemacau spokesperson said.
Diversified miner South32 and Australian rival Sandfire Resources dropped out of the race after the first bidding round due to the mine's high valuation, the two sources said.
Khoemacau may be valued at between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, three banking sources added.
South32's CEO Graham Kerr appeared to balk at the cost during the company's earnings results in August, saying: "That's probably a very competitive process and one that will be a little bit too rich for our blood."
South32 declined to comment further.
Analysts at Citigroup said in a note that while the assets could be valued at $1.8 billion, the investment would be worthwhile for South32 at $1.2 billion.
A spokesperson for Sandfire declined to comment on the process.
Khoemacau is located in the Kalahari Copper Belt, a vast swathe of land that stretches from north-east Botswana to parts of western Namibia.
It produces about 60,000 tons of copper and about 2 million ounces of silver per year. Future output could be ramped up to about 130,000 tons of copper and 5 million ounces of silver per year with additional investments.
Khoemacau's owners are open to either a partnership or an outright sale, one of the sources said.

With 66% ownership of the shares, Sandfire Resources Limited (ASX:SFR) is heavily dominated by institutional owners 2023-10-02T22:48:09.000Z

A look at the shareholders of Sandfire Resources Limited (
) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 66% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Sandfire Resources.
Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.
Sandfire Resources already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Sandfire Resources' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Sandfire Resources. The company's largest shareholder is Australian Super Pty Ltd, with ownership of 15%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 5.4% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.1% by the third-largest shareholder.
We also observed that the top 9 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.
Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
We can see that insiders own shares in Sandfire Resources Limited. It is a pretty big company, so it is generally a positive to see some potentially meaningful alignment. In this case, they own around AU$34m worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking 
The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 32% stake in Sandfire Resources. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Be aware that 
, you should know about...
But ultimately 
, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at

Those who invested in Sandfire Resources (ASX:SFR) three years ago are up 62% 2023-11-26T22:24:33.000Z

By buying an index fund, investors can approximate the average market return. But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. For example, 
 (
) shareholders have seen the share price rise 41% over three years, well in excess of the market return (5.2%, not including dividends). On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 21%.
Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.
In his essay 
 Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.
Over the last three years, Sandfire Resources failed to grow earnings per share, which fell 42% (annualized).
Thus, it seems unlikely that the market is focussed on EPS growth at the moment. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.
It could be that the revenue growth of 26% per year is viewed as evidence that Sandfire Resources is growing. If the company is being managed for the long term good, today's shareholders might be right to hold on.
You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).
Sandfire Resources is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. So we recommend checking out this 
 
We've already covered Sandfire Resources' share price action, but we should also mention its total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Its history of dividend payouts mean that Sandfire Resources' TSR of 62% over the last 3 years is better than the share price return.
It's good to see that Sandfire Resources has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 21% in the last twelve months. That's better than the annualised return of 4% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Sandfire Resources better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - Sandfire Resources has

An Intrinsic Calculation For Sandfire Resources Limited (ASX:SFR) Suggests It's 38% Undervalued 2023-12-17T22:24:22.000Z

In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Sandfire Resources Limited (
) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.
Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the 
 may be something of interest to you.
We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:
 = US$1.5b
The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.1%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$239m× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.1%– 2.1%) = US$4.0b
= TV / (1 + r)
= US$4.0b÷ ( 1 + 8.1%)
= US$1.8b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$3.3b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of AU$6.7, the company appears quite undervalued at a 38% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.
The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Sandfire Resources as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.209. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to "what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Sandfire Resources, we've put together three fundamental items you should further examine:

Sandfire Resources Limited (ASX:SFR) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 70% 2024-04-09T01:31:15.000Z

Every investor in Sandfire Resources Limited (
) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 70% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.
Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Sandfire Resources.
Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.
We can see that Sandfire Resources does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Sandfire Resources, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.
Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Sandfire Resources. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Australian Super Pty Ltd with 15% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.1% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.4% by the third-largest shareholder.
On further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 8 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.
Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.
We can see that insiders own shares in Sandfire Resources Limited. It is a pretty big company, so it is generally a positive to see some potentially meaningful alignment. In this case, they own around AU$48m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see this level of investment by insiders. You can 
The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 28% stake in Sandfire Resources. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.

Investors in Sandfire Resources (ASX:SFR) have seen favorable returns of 43% over the past year 2024-05-06T02:25:38.000Z

Passive investing in index funds can generate returns that roughly match the overall market. But you can significantly boost your returns by picking above-average stocks. For example, the 
 (
) share price is up 43% in the last 1 year, clearly besting the market return of around 6.3% (not including dividends). If it can keep that out-performance up over the long term, investors will do very well! It is also impressive that the stock is up 32% over three years, adding to the sense that it is a real winner.
Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.
To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.
Over the last twelve months Sandfire Resources went from profitable to unprofitable. While this may prove temporary, we'd consider it a negative, so we would not have expected to see the share price up. We might get a clue to explain the share price move by looking to other metrics.
Sandfire Resources' revenue actually dropped 24% over last year. So the fundamental metrics don't provide an obvious explanation for the share price gain.
You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).
We're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. You can see what analysts are predicting for Sandfire Resources in this 
 
.
It's good to see that Sandfire Resources has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 43% in the last twelve months. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 11%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. Before spending more time on Sandfire Resources

An Intrinsic Calculation For Sandfire Resources Limited (ASX:SFR) Suggests It's 27% Undervalued 2024-06-02T23:22:45.000Z

How far off is Sandfire Resources Limited (
) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.
Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the 
.
We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:
 = US$1.7b
The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.3%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.0%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$260m× (1 + 2.3%) ÷ (8.0%– 2.3%) = US$4.6b
= TV / (1 + r)
= US$4.6b÷ ( 1 + 8.0%)
= US$2.1b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$3.9b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of AU$9.3, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 27% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.
We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Sandfire Resources as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.246. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to "what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For Sandfire Resources, we've put together three additional elements you should further examine:

Exploring Three ASX Stocks Estimated To Be Up To 27.8% Below Intrinsic Value 2024-07-07T19:07:59.000Z

Despite a slight downturn this week, the ASX200 has shown varied sector performance with notable movements in Health Care and Materials. As investors navigate these shifts, identifying stocks that appear undervalued relative to their intrinsic value could present opportunities for those looking to potentially enhance their portfolios amid current market conditions.
We'll examine a selection from our screener results
 Codan Limited is a technology solutions provider serving United Nations organizations, mining companies, security and military groups, government departments, and individuals, with a market capitalization of approximately A$2.16 billion.
 Codan Limited generates revenue through its communications and metal detection segments, amounting to A$291.50 million and A$212.20 million respectively.
 27.8%
Codan is considered undervalued based on discounted cash flow analysis, trading at A$11.91 against a fair value estimate of A$16.49, reflecting a notable discount. The company's earnings are expected to grow by 16.2% annually, outpacing the Australian market's forecast growth of 13.1%. Additionally, Codan's revenue growth projection stands at 9.1% per year, surpassing the broader market expectation of 5.3%. This financial performance suggests potential for increased investor interest due to its robust growth forecasts and current valuation levels.
 Nickel Industries Limited is a company focused on nickel ore mining and the production of nickel pig iron and nickel matte, with a market capitalization of approximately A$3.51 billion.
 The company generates revenue through three primary segments: nickel ore mining in Indonesia (A$36.81 million), HPAL projects in Indonesia and Hong Kong (A$32.58 million), and RKEF projects in Indonesia and Singapore (A$1.81 billion).
 15.2%
Nickel Industries, priced at A$0.82, is currently valued below its estimated fair value of A$0.97, presenting a moderate undervaluation based on discounted cash flow analysis. Despite this, the company's earnings are expected to grow by 37.1% annually, significantly outpacing the Australian market's growth rate of 13.1%. However, its dividend sustainability is questionable as it is not well-covered by cash flows. Recent financial activities include securing a substantial USD 250 million term loan to support strategic acquisitions and expansions.
 Sandfire Resources Limited is a mining company that focuses on the exploration, evaluation, and development of mineral tenements and projects, with a market capitalization of approximately A$4.15 billion.

NAIROBI/LONDON, Sept 5 (Reuters) -
At least three South African miners are in the running to buy Botswana's Khoemacau copper mine that is home to one of Africa's largest copper deposits, several sources told Reuters, as growing demand for the metal ensures strong competition for the sought-after asset.
Johannesburg-listed Impala Platinum, Exxaro Resources and Sibanye Stillwater are weighing bids for the copper and silver mine in Botswana, said the sources with knowledge of the matter, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the information.
A number of unnamed Chinese investors, are also on the list of companies interested in Khoemacau Copper Mining operations, one of the sources said.
Impala declined to comment. Exxaro did not immediately respond to emailed questions. Sibanye confirmed its interest.
"We are looking all the time for opportunities and Khoemacau came up on our radar and we have entered into an non-disclosure agreement to try and understand the opportunity better," Sibanye spokesperson James Wellsted told Reuters. "But Khoemacau is a bit more competitive and we are not going to enter into a bidding war that ends up not creating value."
An increase in copper demand for applications from solar panels to electric cars in coming years has prompted miners to scramble for more supplies of the metal.
Copper prices have fallen due to fears of a global slowdown, but longer-term prospects for the metal and a competitive bidding process will make it hard for any of the bidders to strike a bargain, two of the sources said.
Khoemacau's owners - Cupric Canyon LP, a U.S. private equity firm with funds managed by Global Natural Resources Investments (GNRI) and Resource Capital Fund VII LP - said in May they had begun to engage with potential buyers.
The process is expected to take several months and be finalised close to the end of 2023, a Khoemacau spokesperson said.
Diversified miner South32 and Australian rival Sandfire Resources dropped out of the race after the first bidding round due to the mine's high valuation, the two sources said.
Khoemacau may be valued at between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, three banking sources added.
South32's CEO Graham Kerr appeared to balk at the cost during the company's earnings results in August, saying: "That's probably a very competitive process and one that will be a little bit too rich for our blood."
South32 declined to comment further.
Analysts at Citigroup said in a note that while the assets could be valued at $1.8 billion, the investment would be worthwhile for South32 at $1.2 billion.
A spokesperson for Sandfire declined to comment on the process.
Khoemacau is located in the Kalahari Copper Belt, a vast swathe of land that stretches from north-east Botswana to parts of western Namibia.
It produces about 60,000 tons of copper and about 2 million ounces of silver per year. Future output could be ramped up to about 130,000 tons of copper and 5 million ounces of silver per year with additional investments.
Khoemacau's owners are open to either a partnership or an outright sale, one of the sources said.

With 66% ownership of the shares, Sandfire Resources Limited (ASX:SFR) is heavily dominated by institutional owners 2023-10-02T22:48:09.000Z

A look at the shareholders of Sandfire Resources Limited (
) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 66% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Sandfire Resources.
Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.
Sandfire Resources already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Sandfire Resources' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Sandfire Resources. The company's largest shareholder is Australian Super Pty Ltd, with ownership of 15%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 5.4% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.1% by the third-largest shareholder.
We also observed that the top 9 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.
Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
We can see that insiders own shares in Sandfire Resources Limited. It is a pretty big company, so it is generally a positive to see some potentially meaningful alignment. In this case, they own around AU$34m worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking 
The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 32% stake in Sandfire Resources. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Be aware that

But ultimately 
, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at

Those who invested in Sandfire Resources (ASX:SFR) three years ago are up 62% 2023-11-26T22:24:33.000Z

By buying an index fund, investors can approximate the average market return. But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. For example, 
 (
) shareholders have seen the share price rise 41% over three years, well in excess of the market return (5.2%, not including dividends). On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 21%.
Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.
In his essay 
 Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.
Over the last three years, Sandfire Resources failed to grow earnings per share, which fell 42% (annualized).
Thus, it seems unlikely that the market is focussed on EPS growth at the moment. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.
It could be that the revenue growth of 26% per year is viewed as evidence that Sandfire Resources is growing. If the company is being managed for the long term good, today's shareholders might be right to hold on.
You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).
Sandfire Resources is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. So we recommend checking out this 
 
We've already covered Sandfire Resources' share price action, but we should also mention its total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Its history of dividend payouts mean that Sandfire Resources' TSR of 62% over the last 3 years is better than the share price return.
It's good to see that Sandfire Resources has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 21% in the last twelve months. That's better than the annualised return of 4% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Sandfire Resources better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - Sandfire Resources has

An Intrinsic Calculation For Sandfire Resources Limited (ASX:SFR) Suggests It's 38% Undervalued 2023-12-17T22:24:22.000Z

In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Sandfire Resources Limited (
) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.
Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the 
 may be something of interest to you.
We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:
 = US$1.5b
The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.1%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$239m× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.1%– 2.1%) = US$4.0b
= TV / (1 + r)
= US$4.0b÷ ( 1 + 8.1%)
= US$1.8b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$3.3b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of AU$6.7, the company appears quite undervalued at a 38% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.
The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Sandfire Resources as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.209. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to "what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Sandfire Resources, we've put together three fundamental items you should further examine:

Sandfire Resources Limited (ASX:SFR) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 70% 2024-04-09T01:31:15.000Z

Every investor in Sandfire Resources Limited (
) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 70% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.
Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Sandfire Resources.
Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.
We can see that Sandfire Resources does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Sandfire Resources, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.
Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Sandfire Resources. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Australian Super Pty Ltd with 15% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.1% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.4% by the third-largest shareholder.
On further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 8 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.
Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.
We can see that insiders own shares in Sandfire Resources Limited. It is a pretty big company, so it is generally a positive to see some potentially meaningful alignment. In this case, they own around AU$48m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see this level of investment by insiders. You can

Investors in Sandfire Resources (ASX:SFR) have seen favorable returns of 43% over the past year 2024-05-06T02:25:38.000Z

Passive investing in index funds can generate returns that roughly match the overall market. But you can significantly boost your returns by picking above-average stocks. For example, the 
 (
) share price is up 43% in the last 1 year, clearly besting the market return of around 6.3% (not including dividends). If it can keep that out-performance up over the long term, investors will do very well! It is also impressive that the stock is up 32% over three years, adding to the sense that it is a real winner.
Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.
To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.
Over the last twelve months Sandfire Resources went from profitable to unprofitable. While this may prove temporary, we'd consider it a negative, so we would not have expected to see the share price up. We might get a clue to explain the share price move by looking to other metrics.
Sandfire Resources' revenue actually dropped 24% over last year. So the fundamental metrics don't provide an obvious explanation for the share price gain.
You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).
We're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years.

.
It's good to see that Sandfire Resources has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 43% in the last twelve months. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 11%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. Before spending more time on Sandfire Resources

An Intrinsic Calculation For Sandfire Resources Limited (ASX:SFR) Suggests It's 27% Undervalued 2024-06-02T23:22:45.000Z

How far off is Sandfire Resources Limited (
) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.
Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the 
.
We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:
 = US$1.7b
The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.3%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.0%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$260m× (1 + 2.3%) ÷ (8.0%– 2.3%) = US$4.6b
= TV / (1 + r)
= US$4.6b÷ ( 1 + 8.0%)
= US$2.1b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$3.9b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of AU$9.3, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 27% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.
We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Sandfire Resources as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.246. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to "what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For Sandfire Resources, we've put together three additional elements you should further examine:

3 ASX Stocks Estimated To Be Below Market Value In June 2024 2024-06-20T19:08:02.000Z

In the past year, the Australian stock market has shown modest growth with a 6.7% increase, while maintaining stability over the last week. Given these conditions and expected future earnings growth, stocks that are currently undervalued may present particularly appealing opportunities for investors looking for potential gains in a growing market.
We're going to check out a few of the best picks from our screener tool
 Credit Corp Group Limited, operating in Australia and the United States, specializes in debt ledger purchase and collection as well as consumer lending services, with a market capitalization of approximately A$1.02 billion.
 Credit Corp Group's revenue is derived from debt ledger purchasing in the United States (A$40.32 million), Australia and New Zealand (A$235.28 million), and consumer lending across these regions plus the United States (A$164.48 million).
 37.3%
Credit Corp Group is currently trading at A$14.95, significantly below the estimated fair value of A$23.8, indicating a potential undervaluation based on discounted cash flows. While the company's earnings are expected to grow by 24.9% annually, outpacing the Australian market's average, its revenue growth forecast of 10.6% also exceeds the market expectation of 5.5%. However, challenges include a profit margin decrease from last year and dividends that are not well-covered by cash flows, reflecting some financial strain.
 Nickel Industries Limited is involved in the mining of nickel ore and the production of nickel pig iron and nickel matte, with a market capitalization of approximately A$3.66 billion.
 The company generates revenue through three primary segments: nickel ore mining in Indonesia contributing A$36.81 million, HPAL projects in Indonesia and Hong Kong totaling A$32.58 million, and RKEF projects across Indonesia and Singapore amounting to A$1.81 billion.
 13.6%
Nickel Industries is priced at A$0.86, below the estimated fair value of A$0.99, suggesting a modest undervaluation. The company's earnings are projected to grow significantly at 36.7% annually, outstripping the broader Australian market's growth rate. However, its dividend sustainability is questionable due to inadequate cash flow coverage and a recent increase in shareholder dilution, alongside lower profit margins compared to the previous year.
 Sandfire Resources Limited is a mining company focused on the exploration, evaluation, and development of mineral tenements and projects, with a market capitalization of approximately A$4.02 billion.
 The company generates revenue primarily from its MATSA Copper Operations and Degrussa Copper Operations, which collectively brought in approximately $676.24 million.
 37.2%
Sandfire Resources, priced at A$8.78, is considered undervalued against a fair value of A$13.96, reflecting a 37.1% discount. The company's revenue growth is expected to outpace the Australian market average at 15.3% annually versus 5.5%. While its return on equity might remain low at 9.8%, Sandfire's earnings are forecast to surge by nearly 60% per year over the next three years as it moves towards profitability, aligning with above-average market growth expectations.

The company's earnings are expected to grow by 16.2% annually, outpacing the Australian market's forecast growth of 13.1%. Additionally, Codan's revenue growth projection stands at 9.1% per year, surpassing the broader market expectation of 5.3%. This financial performance suggests potential for increased investor interest due to its robust growth forecasts and current valuation levels.
 Nickel Industries Limited is a company focused on nickel ore mining and the production of nickel pig iron and nickel matte, with a market capitalization of approximately A$3.51 billion.
 The company generates revenue through three primary segments: nickel ore mining in Indonesia (A$36.81 million), HPAL projects in Indonesia and Hong Kong (A$32.58 million), and RKEF projects in Indonesia and Singapore (A$1.81 billion).
 15.2%
Nickel Industries, priced at A$0.82, is currently valued below its estimated fair value of A$0.97, presenting a moderate undervaluation based on discounted cash flow analysis. Despite this, the company's earnings are expected to grow by 37.1% annually, significantly outpacing the Australian market's growth rate of 13.1%. However, its dividend sustainability is questionable as it is not well-covered by cash flows. Recent financial activities include securing a substantial USD 250 million term loan to support strategic acquisitions and expansions.
 Sandfire Resources Limited is a mining company that focuses on the exploration, evaluation, and development of mineral tenements and projects, with a market capitalization of approximately A$4.15 billion.
 The company generates revenue primarily through its MATSA Copper Operations and Degrussa Copper Operations, which contributed $581.75 million and $94.49 million respectively.
 17.4%
Sandfire Resources, trading at A$9.08, is considered undervalued with its price sitting 17.4% below the calculated fair value of A$10.99. Analysts predict robust annual earnings growth of 52.64%, significantly outpacing general market expectations, and revenue growth forecasted at 15.5% annually, surpassing the Australian market's average of 5.3%. However, its Return on Equity is expected to remain modest at 9.9% in three years' time.

 18.3%
Nickel Industries, priced at A$0.81, is below the calculated fair value of A$0.99, reflecting a modest undervaluation. Despite a profit margin decline to 6.5% from last year's 13.1%, its earnings are expected to surge by 34.89% annually, outperforming the broader Australian market's growth forecast of 13.5%. However, its dividend sustainability is questionable as payouts are not well covered by free cash flows. Recent strategic moves include securing a new US$250 million loan to support acquisitions and extending their buyback plan until mid-2025.
