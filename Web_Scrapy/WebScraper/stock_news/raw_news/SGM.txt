Market is not liking Sims' (ASX:SGM) earnings decline as stock retreats 3.3% this week 2024-04-18T01:10:59.000Z

Passive investing in an index fund is a good way to ensure your own returns roughly match the overall market. But if you buy individual stocks, you can do both better or worse than that. Investors in 
 (
) have tasted that bitter downside in the last year, as the share price dropped 28%. That's well below the market return of 8.4%. Taking the longer term view, the stock fell 26% over the last three years. Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 10% in the last 90 days.
Given the past week has been tough on shareholders, let's investigate the fundamentals and see what we can learn.
There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).
Unfortunately Sims reported an EPS drop of 67% for the last year. This fall in the EPS is significantly worse than the 28% the share price fall. So despite the weak per-share profits, some investors are probably relieved the situation wasn't more difficult.
You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).
We like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. This 
 interactive report on Sims' 
 is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.
Investors in Sims had a tough year, with a total loss of 26%, against a market gain of about 8.4%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 6%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified 
 that you should be aware of.
Sims is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find
