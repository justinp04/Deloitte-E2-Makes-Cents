Santos Limited (ASX:STO) Interim Results Just Came Out: Here's What Analysts Are Forecasting For This Year

Last week saw the newest half-year earnings release from 
 (
), an important milestone in the company's journey to build a stronger business. Santos reported US$3.0b in revenue, roughly in line with analyst forecasts, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) of US$0.24 beat expectations, being 3.2% higher than what the analysts expected. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year.
Following the recent earnings report, the consensus from 14 analysts covering Santos is for revenues of US$6.11b in 2023. This implies a definite 13% decline in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are forecast to sink 14% to US$0.46 in the same period. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$6.12b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$0.53 in 2023. So there's definitely been a decline in sentiment after the latest results, noting the real cut to new EPS forecasts.
It might be a surprise to learn that the consensus price target was broadly unchanged at AU$9.03, with the analysts clearly implying that the forecast decline in earnings is not expected to have much of an impact on valuation. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. There are some variant perceptions on Santos, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at AU$12.87 and the most bearish at AU$7.63 per share. Note the wide gap in analyst price targets? This implies to us that there is a fairly broad range of possible scenarios for the underlying business.
Of course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the 
 itself. We would highlight that revenue is expected to reverse, with a forecast 24% annualised decline to the end of 2023. That is a notable change from historical growth of 17% over the last five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the industry are forecast to see their revenue decline 2.1% annually for the foreseeable future. The forecasts do look bearish for Santos, since they're expecting it to shrink faster than the industry.
The most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results. The consensus also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, suggesting that it is performing in line with expectations. Plus, our data suggests that Santos is expected to perform worse than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at AU$9.03, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.
With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. We have forecasts for Santos going out to 2025, and you can

The 3.9% return this week takes Santos' (ASX:STO) shareholders three-year gains to 65%

By buying an index fund, investors can approximate the average market return. But many of us dare to dream of bigger returns, and build a portfolio ourselves. For example, the 
 (
) share price is up 49% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 12% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 3.0% in the last year , including dividends .
After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals.
To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.
During three years of share price growth, Santos moved from a loss to profitability. So we would expect a higher share price over the period.
The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).
It's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of 
.
It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Santos' TSR for the last 3 years was 65%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the 
 shareholder return.
Santos provided a TSR of 3.0% over the last twelve months. But that was short of the market average. If we look back over five years, the returns are even better, coming in at 4% per year for five years. Maybe the share price is just taking a breather while the business executes on its growth strategy. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Declining Stock and Solid Fundamentals: Is The Market Wrong About Santos Limited (ASX:STO)?

With its stock down 12% over the past month, it is easy to disregard Santos (ASX:STO). However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Particularly, we will be paying attention to 
 ROE today.
Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Santos is:
12% = US$1.7b ÷ US$15b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).
The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every A$1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated A$0.12 in profit.
Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or "retains", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.
To start with, Santos' ROE looks acceptable. Be that as it may, the company's ROE is still quite lower than the industry average of 18%. That being the case, the significant five-year 34% net income growth reported by Santos comes as a pleasant surprise. We believe that there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently. Bear in mind, the company does have a respectable ROE. It is just that the industry ROE is higher. So this also does lend some color to the high earnings growth seen by the company.
Next, on comparing Santos' net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 33% over the last few years.
The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is STO worth today? The 
 helps visualize whether STO is currently mispriced by the market.
Santos' three-year median payout ratio is a pretty moderate 35%, meaning the company retains 65% of its income. By the looks of it, the dividend is well covered and Santos is reinvesting its profits efficiently as evidenced by its exceptional growth which we discussed above.
Moreover, Santos is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to rise to 44% over the next three years. Regardless, the ROE is not expected to change much for the company despite the higher expected payout ratio.
On the whole, we feel that Santos' performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that it has been reinvesting a high portion of its profits at a moderate rate of return, resulting in earnings expansion. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

Calculating The Intrinsic Value Of Santos Limited (ASX:STO)

In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Santos Limited (
) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.
We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the 
.
We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:
 = US$9.5b
The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.7%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.5b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.7%– 2.0%) = US$23b
= TV / (1 + r)
= US$23b÷ ( 1 + 8.7%)
= US$10b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$20b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of AU$7.7, the company appears about fair value at a 19% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.
The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Santos as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.332. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For Santos, we've compiled three relevant elements you should assess:
PS. Simply Wall St updates its DCF calculation for every Australian stock every day, so if you want to find the intrinsic value of any other stock just

Woodside-Santos $52 billion merger talk spurs competition, price concerns

By Scott Murdoch, Lewis Jackson and Renju Jose
SYDNEY (Reuters) -Santos Ltd shares jumped on Friday on the prospect of a possible $52 billion merger with bigger Australian rival Woodside, but investors said valuation will be key, while domestic asset sales are likely to be needed to overcome competition concerns.
After market hours on Thursday, Woodside and Santos confirmed speculation they were in preliminary talks to create a major oil and gas company, which together would have assets in Australia as well as Alaska, the Gulf of Mexico, Papua New Guinea, Senegal and Trinidad and Tobago.
The discussions are being driven by the need for the Australian companies to gain scale to fund the energy transition, analysts said.
The merged group would create a major global liquefied natural gas (LNG) producer that could attract more offshore investors as gas is seen as a key bridging fuel in the shift to cleaner energy.
Bigger global rivals Exxon Mobil and Chevron have also boosted their oil and gas reserves in multi-billion-dollar deals this year.
Santos shares jumped nearly 11% in early trade to hit their highest level in five weeks, but pared gains to settle up 6.2%. Woodside trimmed early losses and closed down 0.5%.
The merger discussions put Santos, the smaller of the two companies, firmly "in play", said Macquarie analyst Mark Wiseman.
"We expect this will trigger interest in STO (Santos) from other parties," he said in a note, adding that the company holds attractive assets at discounted values, such as PNG LNG.
Major European players with interests in the region could eye Santos, UBS analyst Tom Allen said. French giant TotalEnergies co-owns LNG assets in Papua New Guinea and Australia with Santos.
Both Woodside and Santos have lagged the global energy equities boom amid struggles securing environmental approvals for major growth projects.
"It's a dramatic concentration of control," said Tim Buckley, a director at think tank Climate Energy Finance. "But I would emphasize it's coming from a point of weakness. It's coming from a point of ongoing massive underperformance."
UBS said a merger could unlock $200 million in cost savings.
A bid price with a sufficient premium to satisfy disappointed Santos shareholders is going to be the "biggest issue", said Matthew Haupt, a portfolio manager at long-time Santos shareholder Wilson Asset Management.
"I just don't know if Woodside are willing to pay up," he said.
UBS analysts modeled an implied bid price for Santos between A$8.20 and A$8.88, with the lower value reflecting a typical "control premium" of 20%. By comparison, Santos shares hit a high of A$7.58 on Friday.
Macquarie said its valuations suggest a Woodside-to-Santos scrip ratio of 0.31, a long way from Friday's close at 0.24.
The mooted deal would complete the consolidation of Australia's four biggest homegrown oil and gas companies. Woodside just last year combined with BHP Group's oil and gas business, while Santos acquired Oil Search in 2021.
COMPETITION CONCERNS
A merged entity would control about 26% of Australia's east coast gas market and 35% of the Western Australian domestic gas market, according to analysts, which could be a matter of concern for the country's competition regulator.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said on Thursday it would consider if a public merger review into the impact on competition was required if the deal goes ahead.
However, a source with knowledge of the deal discussions said the companies could overcome any "significant concerns" from the ACCC by selling off some smaller domestic assets.
Jarden analyst Nik Burns said Santos' Varanus Island and Cooper Basin assets are likely candidates.
The issue will be getting agreement on price for mature assets in a market with only a handful of interested mid-sized players, for instance Beach Energy, he said.
"What's the market appetite to take these assets? It's not like there is a large playing field of potential buyers," said Burns.

Santos Limited's (ASX:STO) market cap touched AU$23b last week, benefiting both individual investors who own 56% as well as institutions

Every investor in Santos Limited (
) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that individual investors own the lion's share in the company with 56% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
While individual investors were the group that benefitted the most from last week’s AU$1.1b market cap gain, institutions too had a 39% share in those profits.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Santos.
Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.
As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Santos. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Santos' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
Hedge funds don't have many shares in Santos. United Faith Ventures Limited is currently the company's largest shareholder with 5.2% of shares outstanding. The second and third largest shareholders are State Street Global Advisors, Inc. and The Vanguard Group, Inc., with an equal amount of shares to their name at 5.1%.
On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.
While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.
Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.
Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Santos Limited in their own names. We do note, however, it is possible insiders have an indirect interest through a private company or other corporate structure. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own AU$25m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking 
The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a substantial 56% stake in Santos, suggesting it is a fairly popular stock. This level of ownership gives investors from the wider public some power to sway key policy decisions such as board composition, executive compensation, and the dividend payout ratio.
It seems that Private Companies own 5.5%, of the Santos stock. It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company.
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the

Should Income Investors Look At Santos Limited (ASX:STO) Before Its Ex-Dividend?

 (
) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in two days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Accordingly, Santos investors that purchase the stock on or after the 26th of February will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 27th of March.
The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.175 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$0.26 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Santos has a trailing yield of 5.4% on the current share price of AU$7.42. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Santos's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing.
Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Santos is paying out an acceptable 60% of its profit, a common payout level among most companies. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. It paid out 87% of its free cash flow as dividends, which is within usual limits but will limit the company's ability to lift the dividend if there's no growth.
It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.
Click 
Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. This is why it's a relief to see Santos earnings per share are up 7.6% per annum over the last five years. Decent historical earnings per share growth suggests Santos has been effectively growing value for shareholders. However, it's now paying out more than half its earnings as dividends. Therefore it's unlikely that the company will be able to reinvest heavily in its business, which could presage slower growth in the future.
The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. It looks like the Santos dividends are largely the same as they were 10 years ago.
Is Santos worth buying for its dividend? Earnings per share growth has been unremarkable, and while the company is paying out a majority of its earnings and cash flow in the form of dividends, the dividend payments don't appear excessive. Overall we're not hugely bearish on the stock, but there are likely better dividend investments out there.
If you're not too concerned about Santos's ability to pay dividends, you should still be mindful of some of the other risks that this business faces. Our analysis shows 
 and you should be aware of this before buying any shares.

10 Best Long Term ASX Stocks To Invest In

In this piece, we will take a look at the ten best long term ASX stocks to invest in. If you want to skip our overview of the Australian stock market, then you can take a look at the 
Australia is one of the 
 and stands shoulder to shoulder with the developed countries of Europe and North America when it comes to progress and quality of life. However, since most of the world's business flows through America, the U.S. stock market is considerably bigger. These facts also hold true for the European Euronext stock exchanges and the London Stock Exchange, especially since the latter is another hub for global finance.
The Australian economy is quite advanced but also relies on traditional sectors such as mining. When it comes to analyzing the best ASX stocks, and particularly those that might be suitable for the long term, it is important to see which industries dominate Australia, what companies are operating in them, and what the future outlook for these sectors might be. On this front, data from the Reserve Bank of Australia can be of some help. Its 
 shows that the five biggest industries in Australia are mining, health and education, finance, construction, and manufacturing. Percentage wise, they account for 14.3%, 12.8%, 7.4%, 7.1%, and 5.7% of the Australian economy, respectively.
Building on this, the next thing to ask when thinking about the 
 is whether the current global macroeconomic environment is favorable for some of the biggest sectors of the Australian economy. Well, starting from the biggest Australian industry i.e. mining, this is one of the most sensitive businesses to global economic health. Since 27% of Australian exports go to China, and another 17.5% are headed to Japan, Asian economic health is a key determinant of Asian stock performance.
If you've been following Insider Monkey and have signed up for our newsletter, you'll know that the 
. In fact, even the International Monetary Fund (IMF) hasn't held back and called the economy a 'drag' on global output - a sentiment that comes after ill-fated analyst optimism at the start of 2023 that had seen many analysts opine that a robust recovery in China would prove to be a blessing for commodities and oil in particular. So, since Chinese growth has been lackluster, it's time to see how ASX mining stocks have fared amidst this.
Some notable ASX mining stocks, which trade exclusively on the Australian stock exchange and also through their American Depository Receipts (ADRs) on U.S. stock exchanges such as the NYSE are BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP), Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO), Fortescue Ltd (ASX:FMG.AX), and South32 Limited (ASX:S32.AX). Year to date, their performance is -15.05%, -14.17%, -12.56%, and 10.98%, respectively. Looking at this, it's clear that all these stocks are down year to date and they were under pressure earlier this year when the Australian central bank's meeting minutes revealed that officials had actually considered an additional interest rate hike since they were uncertain that the beast of inflation had been fully tamed.
However, while the biggest Australian industry might be struggling, ASX stocks for the second biggest sector namely health and education have done much better. A highly developed education system and a corruption free society have allowed Australian healthcare companies to hold their ground against their global counterparts. Some of the biggest healthcare ASX stocks are CSL Limited (ASX:CSL.AX), Cochlear Limited (ASX:COH.AX), ResMed Inc. (ASX:RMD.AX), and Sonic Healthcare Limited (ASX:SHL.AX).
Year to date, their performance is -0.13%, 12.16%, 18.75%, and -8.69%. Looking at this, it appears that healthcare ASX stocks have done much better than their mining counterparts, and even better than Australia's premier education consulting firm IDP Education Limited (ASX:IEL.AX) whose shares are down 9.59% year to date amidst a rating downgrade by Bell Porter and changes in Canadian visa rules to scrutinize unscrupulous applicants that seek to work in the country instead of studying there.
Since healthcare is a hot ASX stock sector these days, here's what the management of Mesoblast Limited (NASDAQ:
), an Australian regenerative medicine company had to say during the

With these details in mind, let's take a look at some best long term ASX stocks. A couple of notable picks are Aristocrat Leisure Limited (ASX:ALL.AX), Telstra Group Limited (ASX:TLS.AX), and BHP Group Limited (NYSE:

Along with Telstra Group Limited (ASX:TLS.AX), Aristocrat Leisure Limited (ASX:ALL.AX),and BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP), QBE Insurance Group Limited (ASX:QBE.AX) is a top long term ASX stock according to analysts.
Sonic Healthcare Limited (ASX:SHL.AX) is the first Australian healthcare company on our list, a segment of the ASX that has performed quite well as of late even as mining giants and other ASX stocks feel the brunt of high interest rates and an economic slowdown in the major Asian economies of China and Japan. The firm is also headquartered in Sydney, and it has more than forty thousand employees on its roster. Sonic Healthcare Limited (ASX:SHL.AX) is a medical devices and diagnostics services provider that caters primarily to the needs of hospitals, health centers, and their patients. Its shares are rated Buy on average but teeter on the edge of Hold.
As Australia's economy continues to struggle, Sonic Healthcare Limited (ASX:SHL.AX) made an important announcement in March 2024 when it revealed that it had expanded its global network. This came in the form of an acquisition of a Swiss laboratory for a $132 million price tag.
CSL Limited (ASX:CSL.AX) is another major Australian healthcare company. Given the way that ASX healthcare stocks have performed this year, it's unsurprising that it's yet another healthcare stock to make it to our list of the best Australian stocks to buy for the long term. CSL Limited (ASX:CSL.AX)'s shares are rated Buy on average, and its average share price target of A$302 prices in a 5.23% upside.

Santos (ASX:STO) shareholders have earned a 5.8% CAGR over the last five years

When you buy and hold a stock for the long term, you definitely want it to provide a positive return. Better yet, you'd like to see the share price move up more than the market average. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the 
 (
) share price is up 12% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. Looking at the last year alone, the stock is up 10%.
Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.
While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.
During the last half decade, Santos became profitable. That would generally be considered a positive, so we'd hope to see the share price to rise.
You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).
We consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of 
.
As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Santos, it has a TSR of 33% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!
It's nice to see that Santos shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 17% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 6% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified 
 that you should be aware of.
Santos is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this

Aramco and Adnoc Are Considering Bids for Gas Producer Santos

(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Aramco and Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. have been separately studying potential bids for Santos Ltd., people with knowledge of the matter said, becoming the latest companies to show an interest in the Australian producer’s liquefied natural gas assets.
Most Read from Bloomberg
The stock rose as much as 6.5% in Thursday trading, hitting the highest level in more than two years. They were up 4.2% at the close in Sydney, valuing Santos at A$26 billion ($17.4 billion). The company’s languishing share price has led to several failed takeover attempts in recent years and spurred calls for it to break up its businesses.
State-owned Aramco and Adnoc have been conducting preliminary evaluations of Santos as a possible acquisition target, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. The Middle Eastern energy giants are investing billions of dollars in natural gas, which is seen as an important bridge fuel in the energy transition, especially in Asia.
Aramco agreed last year to buy a minority stake in MidOcean Energy LLC, an arm of investment firm EIG Global Energy Partners that has interests in a number of LNG projects, for about $500 million.
Deliberations are ongoing, and the suitors haven’t decided whether to proceed with any proposals, the people said. Aramco could opt to team up with a partner if it moves ahead, some of the people said. Aramco said in a statement that reports it’s considering an offer for Santos are “inaccurate,” without elaborating. Representatives for Adnoc and Santos declined to comment.
In 2018, Santos rejected multiple offers from US-based Harbour Energy Ltd., while preliminary talks with Woodside Energy Group Ltd. broke down earlier this year. Some investors have urged the company to split its coveted LNG assets from oil operations in Alaska and its domestic gas business in Australia to cash in on higher valuations.
“Santos has been shopping itself for awhile,” said Saul Kavonic, an energy analyst at Sydney-based MST Marquee. “But once they look under the surface at Santos they see too many problems at the legacy onshore Australian assets and walk away.”
Chief Executive Officer Kevin Gallagher, who transformed Santos into Australia’s second-largest oil and gas producer, has been under pressure to boost the performance of a stock that has lagged peers and to crank up shareholder returns. An activist investor last year slammed the company for committing too much capital for growth.
Investors are frustrated and there is no succession plan in place for the CEO, who is coming toward the end of his tenure, Kavonic said. That could create a period of added vulnerability for the much-circled target.
However, the Australian company’s portfolio could be a better fit for European oil majors or MidOcean Energy, he said.
“I would be pleasantly surprised if there was an approach,” said Matthew Haupt, a portfolio manager at Wilson Asset Management, which holds Santos shares. “Santos is an attractive target for other parties, so it’s in play, but not sure it’s the Middle East players.”

Santos Boss Is Racing Against Time to Build a Gas Giant

(Bloomberg) -- Kevin Gallagher is in a race against time.
Most Read from Bloomberg
A veteran of Australia’s oil and gas industry, the Scotsman has earned acclaim for transforming Santos Ltd into the country’s second-largest fossil fuel producer in under a decade. But now Gallagher needs to speed up an ambitious growth strategy that would cement the firm as an international contender ranking alongside Woodside Energy Group and Eni SpA — all while managing impatient investors and circling suitors.
If he falters, the $17 billion company’s lagging share price leaves it vulnerable as one of the most sought-after targets in the sector.
With a A$6 million ($4 million) “golden handcuff” agreement set to expire at the end of next year, with no obvious successor and new potential bidders already in the frame, shareholders are beginning to wonder whether the Santos boss can pull it off.
“Investors saw Gallagher as one of the best CEOs in Australia over the first five years of his tenure,” said Saul Kavonic, an energy analyst at Sydney-based MST Marquee. “But his reputation has been tarnished over the second half, as Santos delivered multiple downgrades. He was unable to deliver on all the promises he sold to the market, and the value of the acquisitions he made started to look more questionable.”
Gallagher’s plan to transform Santos hinges on boosting production volume by more than 50% by the end of the decade, which gives the company one of the strongest growth pipelines in Asia Pacific, according to Neil Beveridge, a senior analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. The expansion bets heavily on the region’s continued appetite for gas as it edges away from oil and coal.
But that promise has yet to translate into a revaluation, with Santos consistently under-performing peers. The stock is up about 8% in the three years through end-June — compared to 27% for Woodside and 83% for Exxon. Its legacy assets in Australia fail to impress investors looking for growth, its dividend and buyback yield has lagged, while slow progress on key new projects, including in Papua New Guinea, continues to weigh.
The result is that Santos has already had to rebuff multiple takeover attempts, including from Australian rival Woodside. More suitors have since emerged, most recently Abu Dhabi National Oil Co and Saudi Aramco, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
“We’re very frustrated by our share price,” Gallagher told investors in November, recognizing that the company is becoming an attractive quarry for predatory rivals.
For now, Gallagher is holding firm, analysts and industry executives say.
“Santos does not need this transaction,” he said in an internal video for staff from December, referring to talks with Woodside, which later broke down. “We have a very strong base business and that’s why there is interest in us.”
Santos did not reply to a request for comment.
A drilling engineer who first came to Australia to work with Woodside after a stint in the North Sea, Gallagher took over as chief executive officer of Santos in 2016 after leading Clough Ltd., an engineering firm. He arrived at a company in the doldrums, struggling to cope with a drop in oil prices, faltering shares and project delays.
Gallagher slashed drilling costs and boosted profitability from the company’s aging gas assets. This allowed the oil and gas producer to better weather the ebb and flow of the energy markets, delivering more consistent profits that won the trust of investors.
He set his sights on expansion through acquisitions — first with producer Quadrant Energy in 2018, and later acquiring Papua-focused Oil Search Ltd. in 2021.
So when Gallagher was being considered for the top job at Woodside that year, the Santos board of directors agreed to a bonus deal to tie him in until the end of 2025. But that deadline is now close — and growth has faced hurdles.
One priority project for Santos is Barossa, which has been criticized for being among the dirtiest gas projects in the world. Gallagher has had to tackle challenging approvals, regulators and third-party litigation, which threatens to delay the project from its 2025 start. Without Barossa, Santos can’t resume production at its Darwin LNG plant, which shut last year after an older gas field ran dry.
Meanwhile, another — an expansion to an existing LNG export plant — has struggled to move forward. The Papua facility was upended by government negotiations, and then the pandemic. TotalEnergies SE, which will operate the facility, delayed the final investment decision to 2025, and analysts are predicting that this could be further pushed off — or scrapped altogether.
An activist investor, UK-based Snowcap Research, last year criticized the company’s aggressive upstream spending plan. It demanded instead stronger capital discipline and better returns. Other shareholders have urged the company to split its coveted LNG assets from oil operations in Alaska and its domestic gas business in Australia to cash in on higher valuations.
“We’d like to see a more robust capital return commitment from the company,” Snowcap co-founder Henry Kinnersley said by email, adding that after meeting Gallagher, the outfit was encouraged on discipline, but saw more to do.
Gallagher does not have to leave the company when his bonus deal expires next year, and could well remain. With no clear successor in place, a decision to move on would certainly leave Santos exposed. Staying would raise the stakes on delivery.
“It may well be that Kevin wants to see the plan through,” said Bernstein’s Beveridge. “We’re still very much in the middle of this plan. The execution is absolutely key.”

Has Santos Limited (ASX:STO) Stock's Recent Performance Got Anything to Do With Its Financial Health?

Santos' (ASX:STO) stock up by 8.7% over the past three months. As most would know, long-term fundamentals have a strong correlation with market price movements, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. Specifically, we decided to study 
 ROE in this article.
Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.
The 
 is:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Santos is:
9.3% = US$1.4b ÷ US$15b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).
The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each A$1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made A$0.09 in profit.
Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or "retain", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.
When you first look at it, Santos' ROE doesn't look that attractive. We then compared the company's ROE to the broader industry and were disappointed to see that the ROE is lower than the industry average of 15%. However, we we're pleasantly surprised to see that Santos grew its net income at a significant rate of 33% in the last five years. So, there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.
As a next step, we compared Santos' net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 33% in the same period.
The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is Santos fairly valued compared to other companies? These 
 might help you decide.
Santos' three-year median payout ratio is a pretty moderate 40%, meaning the company retains 60% of its income. So it seems that Santos is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees impressive growth in its earnings (discussed above) and pays a dividend that's well covered.
Additionally, Santos has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 57% over the next three years. Despite the higher expected payout ratio, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much.
On the whole, we do feel that Santos has some positive attributes. Despite its low rate of return, the fact that the company reinvests a very high portion of its profits into its business, no doubt contributed to its high earnings growth. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.
