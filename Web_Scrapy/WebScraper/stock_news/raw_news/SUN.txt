Australian competition watchdog rejects ANZ’s $3.2B Suncorp deal

Investing.com -- Australia’s antitrust regulator said on Friday that it had rejected ANZ Group's (ASX:ANZ) A$4.9 billion (A$1 = $0.6555) acquisition of Suncorp Group's (ASX:SUN) banking arm, citing concerns over sufficient competition in the home loan industry.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said that it was not satisfied that the acquisition would not reduce competition in the supply of home loans, and would further crystalize the market share enjoyed by Australia’s big four banks.
“The proposed acquisition of Suncorp Bank by ANZ would further entrench an oligopoly market structure that is concentrated, with the four major banks dominating. It also limits the options for second-tier banks to combine and strengthen in a way that would create a greater competitive threat to the major banks,” ACCC Deputy Chair Mick Keogh said in a statement.
Keogh also noted that second-tier banks such as Suncorp were essential in providing competition to Australia’s biggest lenders.
ANZ had announced the Suncorp deal in July 2022, and had said that buying Suncorp’s banking arm was intended to help it reclaim market share lost to its major competitors. The deal was expected to boost ANZ’s mortgage portfolio by about A$47B, and would have also given the bank a pathway into Queensland, where most of Suncorp’s operations are based.
ANZ is the smallest of Australia’s big four banks by 
, with the Suncorp deal intended to boost its share of the mortgage market. The bank and most of its peers are seeing increased competition as local credit conditions tighten due to rising interest rates.
Both ANZ and Suncorp expressed disappointment over the ACCC decision in separate statements. ANZ CEO Shayne Elliott said he believed the deal would increase competition and benefit Australian consumers, while noting that the ACCC rejection could be reviewed by the independent Australian Competition Tribunal.
Suncorp Chair Christine McLoughlin also said the decision would be referred to the Australian Competition Tribunal.
ANZ’s Australian shares rose 1.2% after the ACCC announcement, while Suncorp fell 0.8%.

Australia regulator blocks $3.2 billion ANZ-Suncorp bank deal

By Byron Kaye and Himanshi Akhand
(Reuters) -Australia's competition regulator on Friday blocked a A$4.9 billion ($3.2 billion) buyout planned by No.4 bank ANZ Group of insurer Suncorp's banking arm, setting the scene for a drawn-out legal challenge.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said it was concerned a tie-up between the financial firms would worsen competition and "further entrench an oligopoly market structure" where four lenders including ANZ have three quarters of the country's A$2 trillion in home loans.
"The proposed acquisition increases the likelihood that the major banks adopt a 'live and let live' approach to each other ... instead of competing strongly on price, innovation and the quality of their service," ACCC Deputy Chair Mick Keogh said in a statement on Friday.
"A substantial lessening of competition in home loans would have major flow-on impacts to Australians with a mortgage," he added.
The decision leaves Melbourne-based ANZ, which has trailed behind its larger rivals in the cutthroat mortgage market for years, without a straightforward path to growing its loan book at a time when banks are struggling to attract new borrowers after 400 basis points of interest rate hikes in a year.
It also leaves Suncorp, one of Australia's biggest general insurers, without an avenue for simplification as extreme weather events put pressure on its core business.
The financial firms said in separate statements that they were disappointed and disagreed with the decision. The companies said they would seek a review of the determination at the Australian Competition Tribunal, an offshoot of the federal court which oversees takeover rulings.
ANZ shares rose 1% and Suncorp shares dipped 0.6% in morning trading, against a flat overall market, as analysts noted that the regulator had previously flagged its concerns and the deal had become less attractive in a softening property market.
"If the transaction is abandoned, ANZ avoids a transaction that is increasingly unpopular with investors and gains a material capital surplus," Citi analysts said in a client note.
Taking the deal to the competition tribunal would delay its completion to mid-2024, if the tribunal approved it, from the late 2023 timeline the companies gave when they announced it a year ago.
However, the most recent major ACCC-rejected deal to go to the tribunal, a telecommunications network-sharing arrangement between heavyweights Telstra and TPG Telcom, was blocked again there.
The ANZ-Suncorp deal was one of the biggest deals for the ACCC since chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb started in March 2022, but she recused herself from the matter because of potential conflicts with her previous work as a private competition lawyer.
The ANZ-Suncorp deal also needs sign-off from Treasurer Jim Chalmers who declined to comment.

Here's Why We Think Suncorp Group (ASX:SUN) Might Deserve Your Attention Today

The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. But as Peter Lynch said in 
, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.
Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like 
 (
). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it.
If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Impressively, Suncorp Group has grown EPS by 22% per year, compound, in the last three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up 
 sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.
It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Our analysis has highlighted that Suncorp Group's revenue 
 did not account for all of their revenue in the previous 12 months, so our analysis of its margins might not accurately reflect the underlying business. The good news is that Suncorp Group is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 10.4 percentage points to 19%, over the last year. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.
You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image.
Of course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to 
.
Insider interest in a company always sparks a bit of intrigue and many investors are on the lookout for companies where insiders are putting their money where their mouth is. Because often, the purchase of stock is a sign that the buyer views it as undervalued. However, insiders are sometimes wrong, and we don't know the exact thinking behind their acquisitions.
Any way you look at it Suncorp Group shareholders can gain quiet confidence from the fact that insiders shelled out AU$437k to buy stock, over the last year. This, combined with the lack of sales from insiders, should be a great signal for shareholders in what's to come. We also note that it was the Independent Non-Executive Director, Duncan West, who made the biggest single acquisition, paying AU$250k for shares at about AU$10.17 each.
It's reassuring that Suncorp Group insiders are buying the stock, but that's not the only reason to think management are fair to shareholders. Namely, Suncorp Group has a very reasonable level of CEO pay. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Suncorp Group, with market caps over AU$12b, is about AU$5.8m.
Suncorp Group offered total compensation worth AU$4.9m to its CEO in the year to June 2022. That seems pretty reasonable, especially given it's below the median for similar sized companies. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.
For growth investors, Suncorp Group's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. To add to the positives, Suncorp Group has recorded instances of insider buying and a modest executive pay to boot. On balance the message seems to be that this stock is worth looking at, at least for a while. Even so, be aware that 
, and 1 of those is potentially serious...
Keen growth investors love to see insider buying. Thankfully, Suncorp Group isn't the only one. You can see a

Suncorp Group (ASX:SUN) Is Increasing Its Dividend To A$0.27

 (
) will increase its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 25th of September to A$0.27. This will take the annual payment to 4.5% of the stock price, which is above what most companies in the industry pay.
We like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. The last payment was quite easily covered by earnings, but it made up 102% of cash flows. This signals that the company is more focused on returning cash flow to shareholders, but it could mean that the dividend is exposed to cuts in the future.
Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 30.8% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 49%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.
The company has a long dividend track record, but it doesn't look great with cuts in the past. The annual payment during the last 10 years was A$0.412 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was A$0.60. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 3.8% over that duration. It's encouraging to see some dividend growth, but the dividend has been cut at least once, and the size of the cut would eliminate most of the growth anyway, which makes this less attractive as an income investment.
With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share is growing. Earnings has been rising at 3.5% per annum over the last five years, which admittedly is a bit slow. Suncorp Group is struggling to find viable investments, so it is returning more to shareholders. While this isn't necessarily a negative, it definitely signals that dividend growth could be constrained in the future unless earnings start to pick up again.
In summary, while it's always good to see the dividend being raised, we don't think Suncorp Group's payments are rock solid. With cash flows lacking, it is difficult to see how the company can sustain a dividend payment. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.
Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. To that end, Suncorp Group has

Is Suncorp Group Limited's (ASX:SUN) ROE Of 8.7% Impressive?

Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Suncorp Group Limited (
).
Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Suncorp Group is:
8.7% = AU$1.2b ÷ AU$13b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).
The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every A$1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn A$0.09 in profit.
Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. The image below shows that Suncorp Group has an ROE that is roughly in line with the 
 average (9.4%).
That's neither particularly good, nor bad. While at least the ROE is not lower than the industry, its still worth checking what role the company's debt plays as high debt levels relative to equity may also make the ROE appear high. If a company takes on too much debt, it is at higher risk of defaulting on interest payments. To know the 2 risks we have identified for Suncorp Group visit our 
Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.
Suncorp Group does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 2.05. The combination of a rather low ROE and significant use of debt is not particularly appealing. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.
Return on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.
But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to take a peek at this

Australia's corporate regulator calls for better handling of insurance claims

(Reuters) -Australia's corporate regulator said on Wednesday it had asked the country's general insurers to improve their claims handling practices and resources after it found issues in multiple areas in a review.
The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has commenced several investigations related to claims handling practices after its review of more than 218,000 claims lodged with six insurers, including Insurance Australia Group, QBE Insurance and Suncorp, during January-March 2022.
The commission found insurers faced unduly pressure due to inclement weather events during and before the period. It also pointed out areas of improvement such as communications, project management and resourcing.
A QBE spokesperson said in an emailed response that the company would continue to work to review and address industry concerns.
An Insurance Australia spokesperson said the company has taken on board the findings and will "always look at any opportunites" to support its customers.
Youi Insurance, a private insurer, also said it would identify opportunities to improve its processes.
Meanwhile, Allianz Australia Insurance, another private player, said it had already taken steps to enhance customer communication and claims experience.
The company said it had more than doubled the size of its permanent catastrophe event claims team due to the rising frequency of extreme weather events.
ASIC Deputy Chair Karen Chester said while an insurer may not be able to control all factors that impact claims, the areas identified for improvement are within their remit.
A spokesperson for the Insurance Council of Australia said the industry would closely study the issues covered in the report to drive further improvements to customer and community outcomes.
In 2022, more than 300,000 disaster-related claims were lodged from four declared insurance events across the country, costing A$7.17 billion ($4.62 billion) in insured losses, according to the council.

Suncorp banking chief executive Clive van Horen to depart by year-end

Clive van Horen, the chief executive of Suncorp's banking arm, is set to leave his role by the end of this year, according to an announcement made by Suncorp to the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) on Tuesday. Van Horen, a former CommBank executive and South Africa native, has been leading Suncorp Bank since August 2020.
Van Horen's departure comes amidst Suncorp's ongoing efforts to sell its banking business to ANZ. The company is currently awaiting a review of the sale by an independent tribunal after the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) rejected the deal. The hearings are expected in December, with a decision likely by the end of February 2024.
During his tenure at Suncorp, van Horen played a key role in preparing the bank for its eventual sale. He led efforts to improve enterprise efficiency and innovate customer experiences. His leadership resulted in a significant turnaround in Suncorp Bank’s profitability over the last year. The bank's net profit after tax grew by 27.7% over FY22 and FY23 to $470 million, reversing a 12.2% loss from the previous financial year. Net interest income also saw a 13% increase.
Suncorp Group chief executive Steve Johnston expressed disappointment at Van Horen's decision but acknowledged his contributions. "Clive and his team have done an exceptional job in simplifying the bank and growing our home and business lending portfolios, particularly in what has been a complex and highly competitive market," Johnston said on Tuesday.
The announcement of Van Horen's departure follows the retirement of Paul Smeaton, the chief operating officer of Suncorp's insurance business. Van Horen is set to pursue an opportunity in the non-bank financial services sector. He has publicly expressed support for ANZ's proposed takeover of Suncorp Bank, citing ANZ's significant investment in technology as a potential benefit for Suncorp Bank customers.
The announcement was made at Suncorp's annual general meeting where chair Christine McLoughlin also discussed the issue of homes being built in areas repeatedly impacted by natural disasters. She called for limiting development on flood plains and encouraging residents to move to higher ground.

Suncorp Group (ASX:SUN) shareholders have earned a 20% CAGR over the last three years

One simple way to benefit from the stock market is to buy an index fund. But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. Just take a look at 
 (
), which is up 51%, over three years, soundly beating the market return of 12% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 37% , including dividends .
Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns.
There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.
Suncorp Group was able to grow its EPS at 22% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. The average annual share price increase of 15% is actually lower than the EPS growth. So it seems investors have become more cautious about the company, over time.
The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).
We know that Suncorp Group has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This 
 
 should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.
It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Suncorp Group's TSR for the last 3 years was 75%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the 
 shareholder return.
It's nice to see that Suncorp Group shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 37% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 5%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted 
 you should be aware of, and 1 of them can't be ignored.

Suncorp Group Limited's (ASX:SUN) CEO Looks Due For A Compensation Raise

The solid performance at 
 (
) has been impressive and shareholders will probably be pleased to know that CEO Steve Johnston has delivered. This would be kept in mind at the upcoming AGM on 26th of September which will be a chance for them to hear the board review the financial results, discuss future company strategy and vote on resolutions such as executive remuneration and other matters. Let's take a look at why we think the CEO has done a good job and we'll present the case for a bump in pay.
Our data indicates that Suncorp Group Limited has a market capitalization of AU$18b, and total annual CEO compensation was reported as AU$3.9m for the year to June 2023. We note that's a decrease of 21% compared to last year. We note that the salary of AU$2.03m makes up a sizeable portion of the total compensation received by the CEO.
On comparing similar companies in the 
 with market capitalizations above AU$12b, we found that the median total CEO compensation was AU$10m. That is to say, Steve Johnston is paid under the industry median. Moreover, Steve Johnston also holds AU$5.1m worth of Suncorp Group stock directly under their own name, which reveals to us that they have a significant personal stake in the company.
Talking in terms of the industry, salary represented approximately 52% of total compensation out of all the companies we analyzed, while other remuneration made up 48% of the pie. Our data reveals that Suncorp Group allocates salary more or less in line with the wider market. If salary dominates total compensation, it suggests that CEO compensation is leaning less towards the variable component, which is usually linked with performance.
Suncorp Group Limited has seen its earnings per share (EPS) increase by 22% a year over the past three years. Its revenue is up 22% over the last year.
Shareholders would be glad to know that the company has improved itself over the last few years. It's a real positive to see this sort of revenue growth in a single year. That suggests a healthy and growing business. Looking ahead, you might want to check 
.
Most shareholders would probably be pleased with Suncorp Group Limited for providing a total return of 86% over three years. This strong performance might mean some shareholders don't mind if the CEO were to be paid more than is normal for a company of its size.
Given the company's decent performance, the CEO remuneration policy might not be shareholders' central point of focus in the AGM. In fact, strategic decisions that could impact the future of the business might be a far more interesting topic for investors as it would help them set their longer-term expectations.
CEO pay is simply one of the many factors that need to be considered while examining business performance. In our study, we found 
 you should be aware of, and 1 of them shouldn't be ignored.

ANZ's $3.2 billion Suncorp bank unit buyout approved by tribunal

By Scott Murdoch and Lewis Jackson
SYDNEY (Reuters) -ANZ Group's A$4.9 billion ($3.2 billion) buyout of Suncorp's banking business was cleared by the Australian Competition Tribunal on Tuesday, paving the way for the bank to press on with the takeover of its significant rival.
The ruling came in response to an appeal by ANZ and Suncorp of a decision by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) that blocked the deal in August on the grounds it would limit competition in Australia's banking sector.
On Tuesday, the Australian Competition Tribunal's deputy president, Justice John Halley, told the Federal Court in Sydney there were sufficient "net public benefits" to allow the deal to go ahead.
He said the proposed deal was unlikely to substantially lessen competition in Australia's home lending market.
ANZ shares closed 2.2% lower, while Suncorp stock ended 6% higher. The S&P/ASX200 finished down 0.08%.
The decision is likely to reignite debate about Australia's merger laws and fuel the ACCC's push for stronger powers and new rules which would make it easier to block deals it sees as anti-competitive. Treasury began a two-year review into merger rules in August.
The takeover still requires approval by Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers and an official sign-off from the government of Queensland, where Suncorp is based.
If the deal goes ahead, Melbourne-based ANZ, which has trailed its larger rivals in home lending, will be able to grow its loan book at a time when banks are struggling to attract new borrowers after a string of interest rate rises.
"This is a significant milestone and an important step forward in the process, however we still have further conditions to meet," ANZ Chief Executive Shayne Elliott said in a statement. "We remain committed to completing the acquisition as soon as possible once all sale conditions are met."
Chalmers said in a statement he would "carefully and methodically consider whether the proposed acquisition is in the national interest" once the bank sought approval.
FIRST MAJOR LOSS FOR ACCC BOSS
Suncorp Chief Executive Steve Johnston said the decision would allow the diversified financial firm to become a "dedicated Trans-Tasman insurance company" as it pared back its business model.
Selling the bank would reduce capital requirements on Suncorp, and Chairman Christine McLoughlin said any remaining excess capital would be returned to shareholders.
The tribunal's ruling is the first major loss for ACCC chairperson Gina Cass-Gottlieb since she became the competition regulator almost two years ago. The ACT last year backed the ACCC when it turned down an appeal from Telstra and TPG on an A$1.8 billion network-sharing deal which the ACCC also rejected.
"Banking markets are critical for many homeowners, businesses and farmers. The ACCC will continue to apply scrutiny to these markets across the breadth of our functions including merger assessments and enforcement investigations," Ms Cass-Gottlieb said in a statement on Tuesday.
The ACCC said last year that allowing the deal to go ahead would "further entrench an oligopoly market structure" in which four lenders, including ANZ, have three quarters of the country's A$2 trillion in home loans.
ANZ, Australia's fourth largest bank by market capitalisation, said when it first announced the Suncorp transaction in 2022 that buying the banking assets would boost its mortgage book by A$47 billion to A$307 billion.
Despite the positive ruling, analysts are questioning whether ANZ buying Suncorp's bank will mean it dramatically increases its home lending market share.
UBS has previously estimated, using December 2023 lending data, that a combined ANZ and Suncorp would become the third-largest home lending and deposit holding bank surpassing rival National Australia Bank
"To put the size of the acquisition into context, we previously estimated Suncorp Bank profit would add around 5% to ANZ Group's profit. We don't view this as a transformational, make or break type acquisition for ANZ," Morningstar analyst Nathan Zaia told Reuters by email.

Market reaction to approval for ANZ buyout of Suncorp unit

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's Competition Tribunal approved ANZ Group's A$4.9 billion ($3.2 billion) buyout of Suncorp's banking business on Tuesday, allowing the bank to press ahead the acquisition.
The takeover still requires approval by Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers and a sign-off from the government of Queensland, where Suncorp is based.
Here is some reaction from financial markets:
AZIB KHAN, BANKING ANALYST AT E&P FINANCIAL:
"We expect completion of the acquisition to weigh on ANZ’s relative share price performance as it reduces the magnitude of potential capital return, and will see ANZ dealing with the integration over the next 3 years for potentially very modest EPS accretion. We also believe the acquisition will add to ANZ’s cost challenges and that the acquisition will not significantly shift the dial in terms of ANZ’s capital allocation which sees the greatest percentage of capital being allocated to its lowest ROE division (being Institutional)."
MORNINGSTAR ANALYST NATHAN ZAIA:
"The acquisition adds scale to areas where ANZ Bank trails major bank peers, with home loans balances to increase by 18%, customer deposits by 14%, and business lending by 9% (but likely closer to 20% in SME lending). Consolidating systems and processes should help lower the cost base, and we see potential for some funding cost savings over time given ANZ's better credit rating. The integration risks are worth taking in our view."
CLAYTON UTZ PARTNER KIRSTEN WEBB:
"The decision shows the important role of merits review by the Australian Competition Tribunal, as a specialist body bringing together law, economics and industry expertise, in deciding whether mergers should proceed especially where public benefits are involved. The ACCC is an experienced regulator, but in the small number of contentious mergers, reasonable minds can differ and the ACCC, which often heavily focuses on theoretical concerns, might not always get it right."
HAYDN FLACK, A PARTNER AT LAW FIRM MINTER ELLISON:
"Policy makers will be assessing what the decision means in the context of the merger reform debate and the ongoing review by Treasury's Competition Taskforce. Everyone will be watching for how this result, and the Tribunal's full reasons when they are finally made public, impact the debate over merger reform."

Australia competition regulator warns ANZ, Suncorp buyout ruling no green light

By Scott Murdoch and Lewis Jackson
SYDNEY (Reuters) -The Australian Competition Tribunal's green light for ANZ's proposed A$4.2 billion ($3.2 billion) buyout of Suncorp's banking assets on Tuesday does not mean similar deals will be waved through, the head of the anti-trust regulator told Reuters.
The ruling delivered by the ACT in Sydney meant ANZ could proceed with the deal despite the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) rejecting the bid on competition grounds last year.
ACCC chairperson Gina Cass-Gottlieb told Reuters in a telephone interview that despite losing the ANZ and Suncorp case, the regulator would in future apply "careful consideration on the parties contemplating an acquisition".
"This is not a green light to future banking transactions. This shows there are serious questions that needs to be assessed on any future transactions," she said.
In his verdict, ACT deputy president Justice John Halley said the Australian banking sector was "conducive to co-ordination" as the four major banks, including ANZ, controlled 72% of the home lending market.
However, he added that the tribunal thought a merged ANZ and Suncorp bank would "not have a meaningful impact on the degree of likelihood of the major banks engaging in successful coordination".
The ACCC said last year that allowing the deal to go ahead would "further entrench an oligopoly market structure" in which four lenders dominate the A$2 trillion home loans market.
The full reasons for the ACT's decision have been given to the parties involved but are yet to be made public.
"From its summary the tribunal seems to have focused on certainty, weighing the potential risk of a reduction in competition that it considered too uncertain and insignificant against the more certain benefits from integration and productive efficiency forecast to arise," said Kirsten Webb, a partner at Clayton Utz.
Treasurer Jim Chalmers launched a two-year competition review in August that will consider a request from the ACCC to strengthen its powers and make it mandatory for companies or deals above a certain size to seek the regulator's approval.
Under the existing rules, it is voluntary to apply for ACCC approval in a merger. The ACCC can take deals which do not apply for a competition review to court.
Cass-Gottlieb said she believed the outcome of the case showed the ACCC should have greater powers to investigate any potential anti-competitive behaviour in deals.

On the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns.
To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.
During three years of share price growth, Suncorp Group achieved compound earnings per share growth of 15% per year. We note that the 18% yearly (average) share price gain isn't too far from the EPS growth rate. Coincidence? Probably not. This suggests that sentiment and expectations have not changed drastically. Quite to the contrary, the share price has arguably reflected the EPS growth.

We know that Suncorp Group has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this

It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Suncorp Group's TSR for the last 3 years was 89%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!
We're pleased to report that Suncorp Group shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 44% over one year. That's including the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 8% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

Do Suncorp Group's (ASX:SUN) Earnings Warrant Your Attention?

Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.
So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like 
 (
). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.
If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Over the last three years, Suncorp Group has grown EPS by 15% per year. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it.
Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Our analysis has highlighted that Suncorp Group's revenue 
 did not account for all of their revenue in the previous 12 months, so our analysis of its margins might not accurately reflect the underlying business. The music to the ears of Suncorp Group shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 13% to 22% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.

Since Suncorp Group has a market capitalisation of AU$21b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they hold AU$20m worth of its stock. That's a lot of money, and no small incentive to work hard. While their ownership only accounts for 0.09%, this is still a considerable amount at stake to encourage the business to maintain a strategy that will deliver value to shareholders.
While it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. Our quick analysis into CEO remuneration would seem to indicate they are. For companies with market capitalisations over AU$12b, like Suncorp Group, the median CEO pay is around AU$6.3m.
The Suncorp Group CEO received AU$3.9m in compensation for the year ending June 2023. That is actually below the median for CEO's of similarly sized companies. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when it's reasonable, that gives a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making.
One positive for Suncorp Group is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. The fact that EPS is growing is a genuine positive for Suncorp Group, but the pleasant picture gets better than that. With company insiders aligning themselves considerably with the company's success and modest CEO compensation, there's no arguments that this is a stock worth looking into. Even so, be aware that 
, and 1 of those can't be ignored...
Although Suncorp Group certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares. If you like to see companies with more skin in the game, then check out this

Australia approves ANZ's $3.3 billion buyout of Suncorp Bank

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia on Friday gave the go-ahead for ANZ Group's A$4.9 billion ($3.26 billion) buyout of Suncorp's banking business, clearing the deal to proceed after almost two years of scrutiny by financial regulators and treasury.
Treasurer Jim Chalmers said the deal can proceed subject to enforceable conditions and had come after careful consideration, and consultation with treasury, regulators and the unions.
"Following this lengthy and robust process, I received clear advice ... that it would not be in the national interest to prohibit this transaction," Chalmers said in a statement.
"The conditions I have imposed are legally-binding and ensure Australians continue to have access to vital banking services (and) employees aren't left behind."
The conditions prohibit ANZ to close Suncorp's regional bank branches and cut jobs across Australia for three years, Chalmers said.
Chalmers said the deal will help Suncorp to focus on its insurance businesses, at a time when the sector faces a range of specific challenges, including access and affordability.
The deal was originally blocked by Australia's competition regulator in August on the grounds it would limit competition in the banking sector. But the Australian Competition Tribunal in February cleared the deal after the two companies appealed the decision.
ANZ CEO Shayne Elliott said the deal will allow it to add scale to its retail and commercial businesses, enabling ANZ to more effectively compete in the Australian market.
"Our plans for the integration are well advanced, and we are confident of the substantial benefits that will flow," Elliott said.

Australia's Suncorp to sell NZ life insurance business for $246 million, shares rise

(Reuters) - Australian insurer Suncorp Group said on Thursday it would sell its New Zealand life insurance business to Resolution Life for NZ$410 million ($246.53 million), sending its shares to a more than 16-year high.
Shares of Suncorp, which had gained a little more than 18% this year by last close, rose as much as 1.6% to A$16.615 as of 0033 GMT, hitting their highest since December 2007, while the broader market was up 0.5%.
"The transaction continues the reshaping of the Suncorp Group, and positions both the general and life insurance businesses for ongoing growth and success," Suncorp CEO Steve Johnston said in a statement.
The company said its New Zealand general insurance business will remain a part of the group.
Analysts at UBS said they believe the New Zealand life insurance unit, Asteron Life, was not core to the group and the divestment is "strategically attractive", allowing Suncorp to focus on its more attractive general insurance (GI) operations.
The transaction comes at an opportune time as premium rates continue to harden across most lines of the GI business, UBS analysts said.
The deal is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to complete within nine months, Suncorp said.

Is Suncorp Group Limited's (ASX:SUN) 8.7% ROE Strong Compared To Its Industry?

While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. We'll use ROE to examine Suncorp Group Limited (
), by way of a worked example.
Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.
The 
 is:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Suncorp Group is:
8.7% = AU$1.2b ÷ AU$14b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).
The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every A$1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated A$0.09 in profit.
Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. The image below shows that Suncorp Group has an ROE that is roughly in line with the 
 average (10%).
That's neither particularly good, nor bad. While at least the ROE is not lower than the industry, its still worth checking what role the company's debt plays as high debt levels relative to equity may also make the ROE appear high. If a company takes on too much debt, it is at higher risk of defaulting on interest payments. To know the 2 risks we have identified for Suncorp Group visit our 
Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.
Suncorp Group clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.90. Its ROE is quite low, even with the use of significant debt; that's not a good result, in our opinion. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.
Return on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.
Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to check this FREE
