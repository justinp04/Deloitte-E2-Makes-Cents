Telix Pharmaceuticals Limited completes the acquisition of ARTMS, Inc.

--(
)--
(ARTMS) is pleased to announce that the acquisition by Telix Pharmaceuticals Limited (Telix) has been completed. This acquisition further enhances the vertical integration of Telix’s supply chain and manufacturing by providing a greater level of supply chain and regulatory control over the production of key isotopes.
ARTMS will support the high efficiency, large-scale and cost-effective production of commercially important medical isotopes for Telix’s portfolio of products, such as zirconium-89 (
Zr), gallium-68 (
Ga), technetium‐99m (
Tc) and copper-64 (
Cu), and will continue to partner with additional radiopharmaceutical companies to ensure that these critical isotopes are available on demand for patients. In addition, ARTMS’ portfolio of advanced cyclotron technologies has immediate application and differentiation for Telix in the production of future commercially important alpha-emitting, therapeutic isotopes, including actinium-225 (
Ac) and astatine-211 (
At).
The history of ARTMS is rooted in a Canadian government funded project focused on solid target production of 
Tc. After that project was successfully completed, the innovation continued and resulted in a full suite of PET products. In 2017, ARTMS Inc. was formed with support and seed funding from Quark Venture, through their Global Health Sciences Fund (GHS) and founding institutions TRIUMF, BC Cancer, Lawson Health Research Institute and the Center for Probe Development. In May of 2020, ARTMS completed a $20M USD Series A fundraising that included GHS and welcomed Deerfield Management to the ARTMS family. In the subsequent years ARTMS has played a critical role in alternative production of medical isotopes with a focus on accelerating the production capabilities of the world’s most commonly installed cyclotrons. The collaboration between ARTMS’ unparalleled team, its investors and founding members has resulted in a truly differentiated organization.
Solomon Partners Securities LLC acted as financial advisor and Norton Rose Fulbright Canada LLP acted as legal advisor to ARTMS during the negotiations and due diligence process related to the acquisition by Telix.
Based in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada, ARTMS Inc. is the global leader in the development of novel technologies and products which enable the high-quality and high-yield production of the world’s most-used diagnostic imaging isotopes. ARTMS’ flagship product, the QUANTM Irradiation System (QIS
), enables decentralized, cost-effective, large-scale production of important medical isotopes such as gallium-68 (
Ga), zirconium-89 (
Zr), technetium‐99m (
Tc) and copper-64 (
Cu) using pharmaceutical distributor and hospital-based medical cyclotrons, empowering users to control their supply chain. ARTMS commercializes these award-winning and proprietary Canadian inventions on a global basis and has the prospect of revolutionizing the nuclear medicine industry.

TLX101-CDx (Pixclara™) Granted FDA Fast Track Designation

, 
 /PRNewswire/ -- Telix Pharmaceuticals Limited (ASX: TLX, Telix, the Company) today announces that 
 (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation
 for the Company's investigational glioma imaging product, TLX101-CDx (Pixclara™
, 
F-floretyrosine or 
F-FET).
The granted Fast Track designation is for the characterisation of progressive or recurrent glioma using positron emission tomography (PET). Concurrently, Telix is in the final stages of preparing its U.S. New Drug Application (NDA) for TLX101-CDx in this initial indication, in both adult and paediatric patients. This designation enables expedited review and closer consultation with the FDA during the review process.
Amino acid PET is currently included in U.S. and European guidelines for the imaging of gliomas
, however there is no FDA-approved targeted PET agent for brain cancer imaging in the U.S. Telix's goal is to make this product commercially available in the U.S., significantly increasing patient access to this important imaging agent.
Telix has an exclusive research collaboration and data license agreement with the 
 (UCSF). UCSF is one of the leading academic centres conducting clinical research into the use of FET PET
 in a variety of neurological malignancies. This academic-industrial collaboration supporting joint development and commercialisation will enable Telix to offer TLX101-CDx access as a commercial product in the U.S., subject to regulatory approval.
, MD, Professor of Radiology at UCSF, said, "There is critical unmet need to improve the diagnosis and management of glioma, particularly in the post-treatment setting, and we are excited to leverage the clinical experience at UCSF to help make this investigational agent more widely available. 
F-FET has the potential to help determine if a glioma is truly progressing or undergoing a treatment-induced change, known as pseudo-progression, where MRI
 – the standard of care – can often be inconclusive."
, MD, Group Chief Medical Officer at Telix, stated, "This unique collaboration between Dr. Hope's team at UCSF and Telix will enable us to utilise our collective clinical data and expertise to facilitate nationwide access to FET PET in 
 while fostering ongoing research and development with the objective of expanding the clinical utility of this advanced imaging agent for the benefit of patients."
Telix has selected PharmaLogic Holdings Corp (PharmaLogic) as its commercial manufacturing and pharmacy distribution partner, to supply finished unit doses of TLX101-CDx to the U.S. market.
, President and CEO at Pharmalogic, added, "Telix has quickly grown into a global theranostics leader with an impressive product pipeline. Through this partnership, we're delighted to bring this imaging agent to glioma patients in the U.S. upon regulatory approval."
Richard Valeix, Group Chief Commercial Officer at Telix, continued, "These milestones represent significant progress as we bring this investigational product closer to market in the U.S. and commercial launch. PharmaLogic has rapidly developed an excellent reputation for manufacturing radiopharmaceuticals to rigorous quality standards and will deliver a key component of Telix's supply chain strategy for TLX101-CDx in the U.S., subject to regulatory approval."
TLX101-CDx (Pixclara™
) is a PET imaging agent, which has been previously granted orphan drug designation (ODD) in the U.S. as an imaging agent for the management of glioma
. TLX101-CDx targets membrane transport proteins known as LAT1 and LAT2
. This enables TLX101-CDx to be potentially utilised as a companion diagnostic agent to TLX101 (4-L-[
I] iodo-phenylalanine, or 
I-IPA), Telix's LAT1-targeting investigational glioblastoma (GBM) therapy, currently under investigation in the and IPAX-2
 and IPAX-Linz
 studies.
Gliomas are very diffusely infiltrative tumours that affect the surrounding brain tissue. They are the most common form of central nervous system (CNS) neoplasm that originates from glial cells, accounting for approximately 30% of all brain and CNS tumours and 80% of all malignant brain tumours
. In the U.S., there are six cases of gliomas diagnosed per 100,000 people every year. GBM is a high-grade glioma and the most common and aggressive form of primary brain cancer, with approximately 22,000 new cases diagnosed annually in the U.S.
. The mainstay of treatment for GBM comprises surgical resection, followed by combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Despite such treatment, recurrence occurs in almost all patients
, with an expected survival duration of 12-15 months from diagnosis
.
PharmaLogic is a world-class contract development and manufacturing organisation specialising in novel diagnostic imaging and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals for the treatment of cancers and other malignancies. In addition to an established and reliable network of radiopharmacies, PharmaLogic has decades of expertise in drug development from discovery, through manufacturing and commercialisation.

Telix seeks prostate cancer imaging kit approval from FDA

Australian company Telix Pharmaceuticals has submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for TLX007-CDx, a new prostate cancer imaging kit.
This kit will be used for the preparation of prostate-specific membrane antigen-positron emission tomography (PSMA-PET) imaging for prostate cancer diagnosis and management.
It is subject to regulatory approval and expected to have extended distribution profile compared to PSMA imaging products that are currently approved with gallium-68 (
Ga) PSMA-PET imaging agents.
The kit's properties allow for more flexible production, including with 
Ga sourced from newer high activity generators as well as cyclotrons powered by the ARTMS QUANTM Irradiation System and GE FASTlab production system.
The company aims to improve the availability and scheduling flexibility of PSMA-PET imaging across the healthcare system.
Despite the availability of PSMA-PET imaging agents in the US, access remains limited, particularly affecting African Americans and Veterans.
These groups suffer from higher incidence rates of prostate cancer, often presenting at advanced stages.
Telix's investigational product seeks to address these disparities and enhance access through nuclear pharmacy distribution partnerships.
Telix managing director and group CEO Dr Christian Behrenbruch said: “The scheduling flexibility and accessibility, along with the excellent clinical performance of 68Ga-based PSMA-PET imaging, has enabled Telix to drive rapid geographic expansion of PSMA-PET imaging with our first product Illuccix.
“A core value of our company is the commitment to improving access to medicine and delivering clinical utility that will benefit patients, very much reflected in the development of this exciting new product. We believe this is particularly important as demand for PSMA-PET imaging is forecast to grow significantly over the coming decade.”
PSMA-PET imaging is an advancement in prostate cancer care, that can replace traditional imaging methods as the standard of care post-diagnosis and during biochemical recurrence.
In December, the company submitted a 
 (BLA) to the FDA for Zircaix (TLX250-CDx).
"Telix seeks prostate cancer imaging kit approval from FDA" was originally created and published by 
, a GlobalData owned brand.

Telix Submits NDA for New Prostate Cancer Imaging Agent

MELBOURNE, Australia, May 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Telix Pharmaceuticals Limited (ASX: TLX, Telix, the Company) today announces it has submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for TLX007-CDx, a new and proprietary cold kit (“Kit”) for the preparation of PSMA-PET imaging
 for prostate cancer.
Subject to regulatory approval, this Kit will enable use of a PSMA imaging product with a considerably extended distribution profile compared to currently approved gallium-68 (
Ga) PSMA-PET imaging agents. The Kit’s innovative properties are designed to facilitate more flexible production, including with 
Ga sourced from both newer high activity generators and cyclotrons powered by the ARTMS® QUANTM Irradiation System™
 and GE FASTlab™
 solid and liquid target production system. The Company believes this will further expand the availability, distribution and scheduling flexibility of PSMA-PET imaging.
Despite the commercial availability of PSMA-PET imaging agents in the U.S., access is still severely limited for underserved patient demographics in many regions. This most notably impacts African Americans
 and Veterans
, who already experience much higher incidence rates of prostate cancer, including late-stage presentation, than the general population.
Telix’s new investigational prostate cancer imaging product is intended to address the unmet needs of patients, referrers and health care professionals, and expand patient reach using Telix’s established nuclear pharmacy distribution partnerships and industry-leading on-time reliability.
PSMA-PET imaging represents a major advancement in prostate cancer management and in the U.S. has replaced conventional imaging methods (bone scan, CT scan) as the standard of care after initial diagnosis and biochemical recurrence
. Despite this major medical advancement, only a relatively small fraction of the 3.4 million men living with prostate cancer in America have undergone a PSMA-PET imaging scan
.
Mike Crosby, Founder and CEO Veterans Prostate Cancer Awareness (VPCa) stated, “Even in some of the most populous U.S. states, access to PSMA-PET imaging can be highly variable. Patients in rural areas of the country often bear the extra burden of long-distance travel, extended time off work, and increased out of pocket costs to access medical services. All of these factors contribute to ‘financial toxicity’ as well as challenges in accessing proper care commonly associated with cancer treatment. If approved by the FDA, this new product will have a significant impact on prostate cancer patients, physicians, and their caregivers by helping to eliminate the inequity of access to PSMA-PET agents, and increase the ability to accurately diagnose cancer early, reducing the cost of care, and increasing the probability of patients’ survival.”
Dr Christian Behrenbruch, Managing Director and Group CEO of Telix stated, “The scheduling flexibility and accessibility, along with the excellent clinical performance of 
Ga-based PSMA-PET imaging, has enabled Telix to drive rapid geographic expansion of PSMA-PET imaging with our first product Illuccix®. A core value of our Company is the commitment to improving access to medicine and delivering clinical utility that will benefit patients, very much reflected in the development of this exciting new product.

Telix Completes Proof-of-Concept Study of TLX592 Targeted Alpha Therapy in Prostate Cancer

, 
 /PRNewswire/ -- Telix Pharmaceuticals Limited (ASX: TLX, Telix, the Company) today announces the successful completion of CUPID
, a first-in-human Phase I dose escalation study of TLX592 in patients with advanced prostate cancer.
TLX592 (
Ac-PSMA-RADmAb®) is Telix's investigational "next generation" targeted alpha therapy (TAT) for the treatment of prostate cancer and is the first clinical program to utilise Telix's proprietary RADmAb® engineered antibody technology. The RADmAb® approach accelerates blood clearance and reduces bone marrow residence time compared with standard monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), while retaining target selectivity, internalisation and retention. The RADmAb® platform is currently under pre-clinical and clinical evaluation for multiple cancer targets.
The CUPID (
 
SMA 
maging and (Bio) 
istribution) study is a 3+3 mass dose escalation study with four patient cohorts intended to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of TLX592. The study utilises copper-64 (
Cu) which is detectable by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) as a surrogate for actinium-225 (
Ac), enabling a successful proof-of-targeting study as well as predictive dosimetry calculations for future studies with 
Ac. Preliminary results in 11 evaluable patients enrolled in the study demonstrated accelerated blood kinetics compared to the standard antibody TLX591, while demonstrating similar (favourable) on-target and off-target biodistribution and hepatic clearance. There were no serious adverse events observed in the study.
Based on these encouraging results, Telix expects to advance TLX592 into a therapeutic Phase I/II study with 
Ac in the second half of 2024, subject to regulatory approval. TLX592 further deepens Telix's PSMA
-targeting prostate cancer therapy portfolio and supplements its lead investigational radio antibody-drug conjugate (rADC) TLX591 (177Lu rosopatamab tetraxetan), currently being investigated in the ProstACT GLOBAL Phase III study. The Company intends to publish and present non-clinical and clinical data supporting these results at several upcoming symposia. 
Dr 
, Group Chief Medical Officer at Telix stated, "The CUPID study demonstrated clearly how theranostic approaches can be used to streamline novel radiopharmaceutical drug development. In this case, PET imaging was used to dose-find a targeting agent for future use with an alpha emitter, while establishing basic safety and utility parameters that will greatly inform ongoing development of this product candidate.
"There is a significant unmet need for novel targeting platforms that may be used with alpha emitting isotopes and avoid renal toxicity and other off-target effects, such as the exocrine gland uptake typical of PSMA small molecule agents. We are excited to progress TLX592 into therapeutic studies where our aim is to develop this agent for both early metastatic prostate cancer and late-stage patients who are no longer responding to lutetium therapy. We would like to thank all participants for their commitment to the CUPID study."

Telix Completes TLX250-CDx (Zircaix®) BLA Submission for Kidney Cancer Imaging

, 
 /PRNewswire/ -- Telix Pharmaceuticals Limited (ASX: TLX, Telix, the Company) today announces that it has completed the submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) to 
 (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its investigational radiodiagnostic PET
agent, TLX250-CDx (Zircaix®
, 
Zr-DFO-girentuximab), for the characterisation of renal masses as clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC).
The rolling BLA submission, initiated in 
 with timelines pre-agreed with the FDA, was based on Telix's successful global Phase III ZIRCON
 study in ccRCC. The clear cell variant of renal cancer is the most common and aggressive sub-type of kidney cancer. The ZIRCON study met all co-primary and secondary endpoints, demonstrating a sensitivity of 86%, specificity of 87% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 93% for ccRCC, including in small, difficult to detect lesions
.
As part of the BLA submission process, Telix has requested a Priority Review under the eligibility criteria of the Breakthrough Therapy designation
. If granted, this would potentially support an expedited review time. If Zircaix®
 is approved, TLX250-CDx will be the first targeted radiopharmaceutical imaging agent specifically for kidney cancer to be commercially available in the U.S. and further builds on Telix's successful urology imaging franchise.
, Chief Development Officer at Telix, stated, "Completing the BLA submission for TLX250-CDx represents a significant milestone for Telix as we bring our Breakthrough investigational kidney cancer imaging agent closer to market as a non-invasive diagnostic for patients. We believe TLX250-CDx is a natural follow-on product to Illuccix® as it is targeted at the same clinical stakeholders, the urologist and urologic oncologist, and leverages the proven commercial and distribution infrastructure developed through the launch of Illuccix®."
As part of Telix's commitment to access to medicine, the Company has opened an expanded access program (EAP) in the U.S.
, named patient programs (NPPs) in 
, and a special access scheme (SAS) in 
 to allow continued access to TLX250-CDx outside of a clinical trial to patients for whom there are no comparable or satisfactory alternate options.
U.S. patients, or physicians who may have eligible patients in the U.S., can e-mail 
 or complete the form 
 for further information.
Physicians in 
 and 
 who may have eligible patients can email 
 and 
, respectively, for further information about TLX250-CDx named patient access.

For more information about ongoing clinical trials of TLX250-CDx, please visit 
TLX250-CDx (Zircaix®
) is a PET diagnostic imaging agent that is under development to characterise indeterminate renal masses as ccRCC or non-ccRCC in a non-invasive manner. Telix's pivotal Phase III ZIRCON trial (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: 
) evaluating TLX250-CDx in 300 patients, of which 284 were evaluable, was completed in 2022 and met all primary and secondary endpoints, including showing 86% sensitivity and 87% specificity and a 93% positive-predictive value for ccRCC across three independent readers
. We believe this demonstrated the ability of TLX250-CDx to reliably detect the clear cell phenotype and provide an accurate, non-invasive method for diagnosing ccRCC. Confidence intervals exceeded expectations in all three readers, showing evidence of high accuracy and consistency of interpretation.

Telix Announces Positive rPFS Data from ProstACT SELECT Trial of TLX591 rADC Therapy Candidate in Prostate Cancer

, 
 /PRNewswire/ -- Telix Pharmaceuticals Limited (ASX: TLX, Telix, the Company) today announces additional positive data from the ProstACT SELECT trial ("SELECT") of TLX591 (
Lu rosopatamab tetraxetan), a lutetium-labelled rADC therapy for the treatment of adult patients with PSMA-positive metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). SELECT is a radiogenomics study intended to evaluate lesion concordance between 
Ga (gallium)-based PSMA-PET
 imaging and TLX591 dosimetry for the purpose of validating PET imaging for patient selection for rADC therapy. The Company has previously reported final safety data from this study
.
The study has reported a median rPFS of 8.8 months, representing an encouraging signal of the potential efficacy of TLX591 in this patient population. The evaluable sample size for rPFS comprised 23 patients with previously treated, progressive mCRPC and who received two 76 mCi intravenous (IV) infusions of TLX591, 14 days apart
. The SELECT trial included a heterogeneous population of low, medium and high disease burden patients to facilitate imaging cross-comparison, with the majority having undergone two prior lines of therapy.
, MD, Nuclear Oncologist and General Internal Medicine Physician and lead recruiter onto the SELECT trial, commented, "We are encouraged by this rPFS result, which compares favourably to small molecule radioligand therapy (RLT) Phase I and II studies at similar stages of development
. This is a compelling signal of the potential efficacy of TLX591 in this heavily pre-treated population. The results further support the development of this candidate in an earlier mCRPC patient population which is the focus of the ProstACT GLOBAL
 Phase III trial and where there remains significant unmet need for effective treatment."
Dr 
, MD, Group Chief Medical Officer at Telix, stated, "TLX591 is a radio-ADC with significant potential advantages compared to small molecule radiopharmaceuticals in treating prostate cancer. TLX591 is differentiated by a patient-friendly dosing regimen with far lower cumulative radiation exposure compared to small molecule radioligand therapies
. This positive signal of efficacy from SELECT builds on prior studies that demonstrated the potential for TLX591 to deliver improved quality of life and durable tumour control in this advanced patient population
."
TLX591 is being further evaluated in the Phase III ProstACT GLOBAL trial in first and second line mCRPC, which is now preparing to enrol patients at its first U.S. sites. This innovative trial design allows physicians a choice of androgen receptor inhibition or docetaxel chemotherapy, thus integrating with real-world standard of care, reflective of Telix's continued innovation in prostate cancer care and commitment to patient outcomes.
TLX591 (INN: lutetium Lu 177 rosopatamab tetraxetan) is Telix's lead investigational radio antibody-drug conjugate (rADC) for the treatment of mCRPC, composed of a high-specificity PSMA-targeting antibody, chelator linker, and cytotoxic lutetium (
Lu) payload. TLX591 is administered intravenously under a two-dose fractionated regimen, potentially enabling the delivery of a highly targeted and potent dose with improved off-target organ radiation exposure. The mAb-based approach may offer distinct advantages in selectivity, internalisation, and retention time over small molecule RLTs for the treatment of mCRPC.
A total of 242 patients have been treated with TLX591 across eight Phase I and Phase II trials
 including a previously published Phase II (open-label, single-arm) trial, which reported a 42.3 month OS in 17 patients with advanced mCRPC when TLX591 was delivered under a fractionated dosing regimen
.
The purpose of the ProstACT SELECT trial is to evaluate the utility of PSMA-PET imaging with Illuccix® to select patients for TLX591 rADC therapy. The primary objectives are to determine whole body biodistribution and organ radiation dosimetry, and assess the safety and tolerability of TLX591 in patients with advanced mCRPC. Radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) is a secondary study objective.

Radiopharma specialist Telix pulls last-minute plug on $232m IPO

In the latest development in the ever-changing biotech IPO landscape, Telix Pharmaceuticals has withdrawn a proposed US listing on Nasdaq.
The decision to pull its IPO was announced on the day it was due to be listed, via a 14 June press release. Australia-headquartered Telix cited that its board did not move forward with its plans due to “current market conditions”, adding that the listing “was not predicated on the need to raise capital”.
The radiopharma specialist, currently listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) since its IPO in its home country in 2017, was on course to raise a potential $232m via American depository shares (ADSs), according to a SEC filing.
Telix’s group CEO Christian Behrenbruch said: “While this is not our desired outcome, Telix’s strategic objectives must align with our duty to existing shareholders.”
The biotech company, which has a market cap of A$5.7bn, resumed trading on the ASX on 14 June after being halted the day before.
Telix first laid out its IPO plans in early January this year, after which its share price increased 42% until its listing U-turn. In that time, the company agreed to 
, along with buying CDMO IsoTherapeutics for a more modest $13.6m. Shares have also been bumped due to “positive therapeutic pipeline data readouts” and product approval submissions to the US Food and Drug Administration for kidney cancer agent TLX250-CDx (Zircaix) and prostate cancer agent TLX007-CDx.
The abandonement of plans for an IPO from a radiopharma biotech ccompany is at odds with the field’s recent growth. Venture financing for radiopharmaceutical drugs witnessed an 
 from $63m in 2017 to $408m in 2023 in terms of total deal value in the US, according to GlobalData’s Pharma Intelligence Centre Deals Database.
GlobalData is the parent company of 
Big pharma has made plays for the space in the past year too, with Eli Lilly, Novartis and Bristol Myers Squibb inking deals ranging from $1.4bn to 
 to acquire radiopharma specialists.
The number of biotech IPOs has been 
 after a boom in 2020 and 2021, although 2024 has seen an uptick in activity. Oncology biotech Boundless Bio 
 in an IPO in March this year, whilst Kyverna Therapeutics, Metagenomi and Alto Neuroscience have all made the jump too. CG Oncology generated the largest US pharma IPO so far this year
 in January. Telix’s U-turn, however, is an indication that the IPO comeback is still stuttering.
"Radiopharma specialist Telix pulls last-minute plug on $232m IPO" was originally created and published by 
, a GlobalData owned brand.

Telix Welcomes CMS Proposal to Improve Payment for Specialised Diagnostic Radiopharmaceuticals

MELBOURNE, Australia, July 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Telix Pharmaceuticals Limited (ASX: TLX, Telix, the Company) today welcomes proposed changes announced by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) for the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) rule to improve payments for diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals
 for Medicare patients in the United States (U.S.), facilitating continued patient access after transitional pass-through payment status expires.
Under the proposed changes, diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals including Illuccix® will continue to be paid separately by CMS for traditional Medicare Fee for Service patients in the hospital outpatient setting following the expiry of transitional pass-through payment status. This would also apply to new diagnostic products being developed by Telix, if approved.
Currently in the U.S., the costs associated with diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals are packaged together into the payment for the nuclear medicine tests (scans). The CMS is proposing refinements to this policy to improve the accuracy of overall payment amounts by paying separately for any diagnostic radiopharmaceutical with a per day cost greater than US$630.
Kevin Richardson, CEO of Telix Americas commented: “Telix welcomes the proposed rule, which will facilitate more equitable and reliable access to advanced imaging for all patients and support physicians to prescribe the most clinically appropriate solution. We commend the vision of CMS and the coalition, along with patient groups, for raising awareness about the necessity to reform the payment system to enhance patient outcomes and access. Telix is committed to continued innovation in the field of radiopharmaceutical diagnostics to provide new solutions to further patient access, especially for underserved patient populations and in areas of high unmet clinical need.”
Proposed OPPS rules are published annually and have a 60-day comment period, which will end on 9 September 2024. The final rule will be issued in early November 2024 and take effect 1 January 2025.

FDA Accepts Telix NDA for New Prostate Cancer Imaging Agent

, 
 
 Telix Pharmaceuticals Limited (ASX: TLX, Telix, the Company) today announces that 
 (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted the filing of its New Drug Application (NDA) for TLX007-CDx, a new and proprietary cold kit ("Kit") for the preparation of PSMA-PET imaging
for prostate cancer. The PDUFA
 goal date is 
.
If approved, the new Kit will enable use of a PSMA imaging product with a considerably extended geographic distribution radius from a nuclear pharmacy compared to currently approved gallium-68 (
Ga) based agents. Its innovative properties are designed to facilitate more flexible production, including with higher activity 
Ga sourced from both newer high activity generators and cyclotrons powered by the ARTMS® QUANTM Irradiation System™
and GE FASTlab™
 solid and liquid target production system. Through this NDA, Telix's objective is to further enhance patient access to PSMA-PET imaging and the clinical benefits of 
Ga imaging to underserved populations across the U.S., using Telix's established nuclear pharmacy distribution partnerships and industry-leading on-time reliability.
PSMA-PET imaging represents a major advancement in prostate cancer management and in the U.S. 
 conventional imaging methods (bone scan, CT scan) as the standard of care after initial diagnosis and biochemical recurrence
. Despite this major medical advancement, only a relatively small fraction of the 3.4 million men living with prostate cancer in America have undergone a PSMA-PET imaging scan
.
Dr 
, Managing Director and Group CEO of Telix stated, "We have seen rapid adoption and geographic expansion of PSMA-PET imaging with our first commercial product Illuccix®. This filing acceptance is an important step towards further improving equity of access and reinforcing our commitment to innovation in prostate cancer to continue to meet the needs of healthcare professionals and their patients. We now look forward to working with the FDA to bring TLX007-CDx to American men living with prostate cancer, including those residing in underserved communities and regions where access to state-of-the art imaging remains limited."

Radiopharma drugmaker Telix pulls US IPO plans

Radiopharmaceuticals are drawing immense interest from venture capital firms, large pharmaceutical companies and public market investors. Four companies in the field have been acquired since last October, while private startups like Germany’s 
 have been able to secure hundreds of millions of dollars from their backers.
Telix’s IPO was set to be another piece of evidence of that interest. The company has a radioisotope imaging agent already on the market, and has drugs for prostate and kidney cancers in mid- to late-stage clinical testing. Progress on those fronts has helped boost its share price in Australia from less than 10 Australian dollars in January to more than AU$16 at its last trading close.
As a result, Telix said its leaders determined the proposed discounts associated with the IPO were not “aligned with its duty to existing shareholders.”
“While this is not our desired outcome Telix’s strategic objectives must align with our duty to existing shareholders. I’d like to thank my team for the personal commitment and incredibly long hours put into this IPO process,” said company CEO Christian Behrenbruch.
Prior to its IPO plans, the company has been acquiring smaller specialists in the 
 and their 
 like antibodies.

Expanded Access Program Opens in the U.S. for TLX101-CDx, Telix’s Investigational Glioma (Brain Cancer) Imaging Agent

MELBOURNE, Australia, July 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Telix Pharmaceuticals Limited (ASX: TLX, Telix, the Company) today announces the opening of an expanded access program (EAP) in the United States (U.S.) for TLX101-CDx (Pixclara™
, 
F-floretyrosine or 
F-FET) an investigational positron emission tomography (PET) agent for imaging progressive or recurrent glioma, following U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) agreement to proceed.        
Amino acid PET is included in U.S. and European clinical practice guidelines for the imaging of gliomas
, however there is no FDA-approved targeted amino acid PET agent for brain cancer imaging currently available in the U.S. Telix’s goal is to make this product commercially available in the U.S., significantly increasing patient access to this important imaging agent for both adult and paediatric patients. The Company expects to file its New Drug Application (NDA) for TLX101-CDx with the FDA during Q3 2024.
Patrick Wen, MD, Professor, Neurology, Harvard Medical School and Director, Center for Neuro-Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, said, “Amino acid PET imaging of the brain is increasingly used to supplement conventional imaging by MRI
, which for many years has been the primary clinical imaging modality in patients with glioma at all stages of disease. After treatment, MRI has several limitations, including the lack of biological specificity, dependency on blood-brain barrier disruption, and an inability to differentiate between tumour progression or recurrence from treatment-related changes. TLX101-CDx (FET-PET) shows potential to provide a more rapid and conclusive diagnosis, inform treatment decisions and deliver a new standard for the management of gliomas in the U.S.”
David N. Cade, MD, Telix Chief Medical Officer, added, “As we finalise the submission of our NDA for TLX101-CDx, the opening of this expanded access program will enable us to provide continued access to this investigational agent, where there is significant unmet medical need in the U.S. Glioma is the most common and aggressive form of primary brain cancer and we believe TLX101-CDx has the potential to make an important difference for U.S. glioma patients who deserve greater reliability in their diagnosis and treatment decision making.”
Under its EAPs – sometimes also called ‘compassionate use’ – the FDA works with companies to allow access to investigational products, outside of a clinical trial, to patients with serious or life-threatening illnesses, for whom there are no comparable or satisfactory alternate options.
U.S. patients, or physicians who may have eligible patients in the U.S. can e-mail 
 or complete the form 
 for further information about the TLX101-CDx EAP.
Telix’s Policy on Offering Compassionate Use to Investigational Medicines can be downloaded at the following 
.
TLX101-CDx (Pixclara™
) is a PET imaging agent, which has been granted fast track
 and orphan drug
 designations by the FDA as an imaging agent for the characterisation of glioma. TLX101-CDx targets membrane transport proteins known as LAT1 and LAT2
. This enables TLX101-CDx to be potentially utilised as a companion diagnostic agent to TLX101 (4-L-[
I] iodo-phenylalanine, or 
I-IPA), Telix’s LAT1-targeting investigational glioblastoma (GBM) therapy, currently under investigation in the IPAX-2
 and IPAX-Linz
 studies.
Gliomas are very diffusely infiltrative tumours that affect the surrounding brain tissue. They are the most common form of central nervous system (CNS) neoplasm that originates from glial cells, accounting for approximately 30% of all brain and CNS tumours and 80% of all malignant brain tumours
. In the U.S., there are six cases of gliomas diagnosed per 100,000 people every year. GBM is a high-grade glioma and the most common and aggressive form of primary brain cancer, with approximately 22,000 new cases diagnosed annually in the U.S.
. The mainstay of treatment for GBM comprises surgical resection, followed by combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Despite such treatment, recurrence occurs in almost all patients
, with an expected survival duration of 12-15 months from diagnosis
.
