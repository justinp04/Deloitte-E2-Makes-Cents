With 54% ownership, Temple & Webster Group Ltd (ASX:TPW) boasts of strong institutional backing 2023-11-17T00:30:29.000Z

To get a sense of who is truly in control of Temple & Webster Group Ltd (
), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 54% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.
Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Temple & Webster Group.
Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.
We can see that Temple & Webster Group does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Temple & Webster Group's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Our data indicates that hedge funds own 12% of Temple & Webster Group. That's interesting, because hedge funds can be quite active and activist. Many look for medium term catalysts that will drive the share price higher. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Kinderhook Partners, LLC with 12% of shares outstanding. With 12% and 8.0% of the shares outstanding respectively, Australian Super Pty Ltd and Netwealth Investments Ltd. are the second and third largest shareholders. Furthermore, CEO Mark Coulter is the owner of 0.6% of the company's shares.
We also observed that the top 7 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.
While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
Our most recent data indicates that insiders own a reasonable proportion of Temple & Webster Group Ltd. Insiders have a AU$106m stake in this AU$819m business. We would say this shows alignment with shareholders, but it is worth noting that the company is still quite small; some insiders may have founded the business. You can 
With a 15% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Temple & Webster Group. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.
We can see that Private Companies own 6.6%, of the shares on issue. It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company.
It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Temple & Webster Group better, we need to consider many other factors.

Temple & Webster Group Ltd's (ASX:TPW) Stock Has Seen Strong Momentum: Does That Call For Deeper Study Of Its Financial Prospects? 2023-12-13T20:59:40.000Z

Most readers would already be aware that Temple & Webster Group's (ASX:TPW) stock increased significantly by 32% over the past three months. As most would know, fundamentals are what usually guide market price movements over the long-term, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. Particularly, we will be paying attention to 
 ROE today.
Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.
The 
 is:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Temple & Webster Group is:
7.7% = AU$8.3m ÷ AU$108m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).
The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every A$1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn A$0.08 in profit.
We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or "retain", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.
On the face of it, Temple & Webster Group's ROE is not much to talk about. We then compared the company's ROE to the broader industry and were disappointed to see that the ROE is lower than the industry average of 20%. Although, we can see that Temple & Webster Group saw a modest net income growth of 19% over the past five years. So, there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.
As a next step, we compared Temple & Webster Group's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 20% in the same period.
Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. If you're wondering about Temple & Webster Group's's valuation, check out 
, as compared to its industry.
Temple & Webster Group doesn't pay any dividend currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This definitely contributes to the decent earnings growth number that we discussed above.
On the whole, we do feel that Temple & Webster Group has some positive attributes. Even in spite of the low rate of return, the company has posted impressive earnings growth as a result of reinvesting heavily into its business. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

Temple & Webster Group Insiders Placed Bullish Bets Worth AU$9.87m 2024-01-05T00:59:19.000Z

Multiple insiders secured a larger position in 
 (ASX:TPW) shares over the last 12 months. This is reassuring as this suggests that insiders have increased optimism about the company's prospects.
Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.
Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by insider Angela Riley for AU$3.6m worth of shares, at about AU$3.62 per share. Although we like to see insider buying, we note that this large purchase was at significantly below the recent price of AU$8.70. While it does suggest insiders consider the stock undervalued at lower prices, this transaction doesn't tell us much about what they think of current prices.
While Temple & Webster Group insiders bought shares during the last year, they didn't sell. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!
There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do 
 want to miss this 
 
Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Insiders own 13% of Temple & Webster Group shares, worth about AU$139m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.
The fact that there have been no Temple & Webster Group insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. On a brighter note, the transactions over the last year are encouraging. It would be great to see more insider buying, but overall it seems like Temple & Webster Group insiders are reasonably well aligned (owning significant chunk of the company's shares) and optimistic for the future. If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this 
 report showing analyst forecasts for its future.
Of course, 
 So take a peek at this

Temple & Webster Group Ltd's (ASX:TPW) Intrinsic Value Is Potentially 96% Above Its Share Price 2024-02-14T20:48:33.000Z

In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Temple & Webster Group Ltd (
) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.
Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the 
.
We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:
 = AU$612m
After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.8%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$178m× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.8%– 2.2%) = AU$3.9b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$3.9b÷ ( 1 + 6.8%)
= AU$2.0b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is AU$2.6b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of AU$11.3, the company appears quite undervalued at a 49% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.
The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Temple & Webster Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.010. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to "what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

Temple & Webster Group (ASX:TPW) Is Experiencing Growth In Returns On Capital 2024-03-06T03:23:16.000Z

If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing 
 on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's 
 of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So on that note, 
 (
) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.
Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Temple & Webster Group:
0.075 = AU$9.8m ÷ (AU$206m - AU$75m) 
.
Therefore, 
 Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Specialty Retail industry average of 18%.
Above you can see how the current ROCE for Temple & Webster Group compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our 
.
We're glad to see that ROCE is heading in the right direction, even if it is still low at the moment. Over the last five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 7.5%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 807%. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.
On a related note, the company's ratio of current liabilities to total assets has decreased to 37%, which basically reduces it's funding from the likes of short-term creditors or suppliers. So this improvement in ROCE has come from the business' underlying economics, which is great to see.
All in all, it's terrific to see that Temple & Webster Group is reaping the rewards from prior investments and is growing its capital base. And a remarkable 768% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Temple & Webster Group can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.
If you'd like to know about the risks facing Temple & Webster Group, we've discovered 
 that you should be aware of.

Temple & Webster Group (ASX:TPW) shareholders have earned a 55% CAGR over the last five years 2024-03-26T20:01:44.000Z

We think all investors should try to buy and hold high quality multi-year winners. And highest quality companies can see their share prices grow by huge amounts. To wit, the 
 (
) share price has soared 793% over five years. And this is just one example of the epic gains achieved by some long term investors. On top of that, the share price is up 49% in about a quarter. We love happy stories like this one. The company should be really proud of that performance!
So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns.
There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.
During five years of share price growth, Temple & Webster Group achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 15% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 55% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth. This favorable sentiment is reflected in its (fairly optimistic) P/E ratio of 178.39.
You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).
We like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. This 
 interactive report on Temple & Webster Group's 
 is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.
We're pleased to report that Temple & Webster Group shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 276% over one year. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 55% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

With 56% institutional ownership, Temple & Webster Group Ltd (ASX:TPW) is a favorite amongst the big guns 2024-04-25T01:07:53.000Z

A look at the shareholders of Temple & Webster Group Ltd (
) can tell us which group is most powerful. With 56% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.
Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.
Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Temple & Webster Group, beginning with the chart below.
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
We can see that Temple & Webster Group does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Temple & Webster Group's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. It looks like hedge funds own 12% of Temple & Webster Group shares. That catches my attention because hedge funds sometimes try to influence management, or bring about changes that will create near term value for shareholders. Kinderhook Partners, LLC is currently the company's largest shareholder with 12% of shares outstanding. With 12% and 8.2% of the shares outstanding respectively, Australian Super Pty Ltd and Netwealth Investments Ltd. are the second and third largest shareholders.
We also observed that the top 7 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.
While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.
I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.
It seems insiders own a significant proportion of Temple & Webster Group Ltd. Insiders have a AU$175m stake in this AU$1.4b business. It is great to see insiders so invested in the business. It might be worth checking 
With a 12% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Temple & Webster Group. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.
It seems that Private Companies own 6.8%, of the Temple & Webster Group stock. It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company.
It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Temple & Webster Group better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks for example - Temple & Webster Group has 
 we think you should be aware of.
But ultimately 
, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at

Are Temple & Webster Group Ltd's (ASX:TPW) Fundamentals Good Enough to Warrant Buying Given The Stock's Recent Weakness? 2024-05-28T22:28:56.000Z

With its stock down 20% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard Temple & Webster Group (ASX:TPW). However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. Specifically, we decided to study 
 ROE in this article.
Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Temple & Webster Group is:
7.9% = AU$8.6m ÷ AU$108m (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).
The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every A$1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of A$0.08.
We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or "retain", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.
On the face of it, Temple & Webster Group's ROE is not much to talk about. We then compared the company's ROE to the broader industry and were disappointed to see that the ROE is lower than the industry average of 17%. Temple & Webster Group was still able to see a decent net income growth of 6.6% over the past five years. So, the growth in the company's earnings could probably have been caused by other variables. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.
As a next step, we compared Temple & Webster Group's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 18% in the same period.
Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is Temple & Webster Group fairly valued compared to other companies? These 
 might help you decide.
Given that Temple & Webster Group doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.
Overall, we feel that Temple & Webster Group certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Specifically, its fairly high earnings growth number, which no doubt was backed by the company's high earnings retention. Still, the low ROE means that all that reinvestment is not reaping a lot of benefit to the investors. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

 20.9%
Kelsian Group, with high insider ownership, shows a promising outlook despite some financial concerns. The company's earnings are expected to grow by 25.84% annually, outpacing the Australian market forecast of 13.9%. While its revenue growth at 5.8% yearly is modest compared to high-growth benchmarks, it still exceeds the market average of 5.3%.

However, challenges include a dividend coverage issue and interest payments not well covered by earnings.
 ★★★★☆☆

With 54% ownership, Temple & Webster Group Ltd (ASX:TPW) boasts of strong institutional backing 2023-11-17T00:30:29.000Z

To get a sense of who is truly in control of Temple & Webster Group Ltd (
), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 54% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.
Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Temple & Webster Group.
Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.
We can see that Temple & Webster Group does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Temple & Webster Group's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Our data indicates that hedge funds own 12% of Temple & Webster Group. That's interesting, because hedge funds can be quite active and activist. Many look for medium term catalysts that will drive the share price higher. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Kinderhook Partners, LLC with 12% of shares outstanding. With 12% and 8.0% of the shares outstanding respectively, Australian Super Pty Ltd and Netwealth Investments Ltd. are the second and third largest shareholders. Furthermore, CEO Mark Coulter is the owner of 0.6% of the company's shares.
We also observed that the top 7 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.
While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
Our most recent data indicates that insiders own a reasonable proportion of Temple & Webster Group Ltd. Insiders have a AU$106m stake in this AU$819m business. We would say this shows alignment with shareholders, but it is worth noting that the company is still quite small; some insiders may have founded the business. You can 
With a 15% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Temple & Webster Group. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.
We can see that Private Companies own 6.6%, of the shares on issue. It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company.
It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Temple & Webster Group better, we need to consider many other factors.

Temple & Webster Group Ltd's (ASX:TPW) Stock Has Seen Strong Momentum: Does That Call For Deeper Study Of Its Financial Prospects? 2023-12-13T20:59:40.000Z

Most readers would already be aware that Temple & Webster Group's (ASX:TPW) stock increased significantly by 32% over the past three months. As most would know, fundamentals are what usually guide market price movements over the long-term, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. Particularly, we will be paying attention to 
 ROE today.
Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.
The 
 is:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Temple & Webster Group is:
7.7% = AU$8.3m ÷ AU$108m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).
The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every A$1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn A$0.08 in profit.
We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or "retain", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.
On the face of it, Temple & Webster Group's ROE is not much to talk about. We then compared the company's ROE to the broader industry and were disappointed to see that the ROE is lower than the industry average of 20%. Although, we can see that Temple & Webster Group saw a modest net income growth of 19% over the past five years. So, there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.
As a next step, we compared Temple & Webster Group's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 20% in the same period.
Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. If you're wondering about Temple & Webster Group's's valuation, check out 
, as compared to its industry.
Temple & Webster Group doesn't pay any dividend currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This definitely contributes to the decent earnings growth number that we discussed above.
On the whole, we do feel that Temple & Webster Group has some positive attributes. Even in spite of the low rate of return, the company has posted impressive earnings growth as a result of reinvesting heavily into its business. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum. To know more about the company's future earnings growth forecasts take a look at this

Temple & Webster Group Insiders Placed Bullish Bets Worth AU$9.87m 2024-01-05T00:59:19.000Z

Multiple insiders secured a larger position in 
 (ASX:TPW) shares over the last 12 months. This is reassuring as this suggests that insiders have increased optimism about the company's prospects.
Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.
Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by insider Angela Riley for AU$3.6m worth of shares, at about AU$3.62 per share. Although we like to see insider buying, we note that this large purchase was at significantly below the recent price of AU$8.70. While it does suggest insiders consider the stock undervalued at lower prices, this transaction doesn't tell us much about what they think of current prices.
While Temple & Webster Group insiders bought shares during the last year, they didn't sell. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!
There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do 
 want to miss this 
 
Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Insiders own 13% of Temple & Webster Group shares, worth about AU$139m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.
The fact that there have been no Temple & Webster Group insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. On a brighter note, the transactions over the last year are encouraging. It would be great to see more insider buying, but overall it seems like Temple & Webster Group insiders are reasonably well aligned (owning significant chunk of the company's shares) and optimistic for the future. If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this 
 report showing analyst forecasts for its future.
Of course, 
 So take a peek at this

Temple & Webster Group Ltd's (ASX:TPW) Intrinsic Value Is Potentially 96% Above Its Share Price 2024-02-14T20:48:33.000Z

In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Temple & Webster Group Ltd (
) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.
Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the 
.
We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:
 = AU$612m
After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.8%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$178m× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.8%– 2.2%) = AU$3.9b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$3.9b÷ ( 1 + 6.8%)
= AU$2.0b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is AU$2.6b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of AU$11.3, the company appears quite undervalued at a 49% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.
The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Temple & Webster Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.010. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to "what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

Temple & Webster Group (ASX:TPW) Is Experiencing Growth In Returns On Capital 2024-03-06T03:23:16.000Z

If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing 
 on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's 
 of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So on that note, 
 (
) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.
Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Temple & Webster Group:
0.075 = AU$9.8m ÷ (AU$206m - AU$75m) 
.
Therefore, 
 Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Specialty Retail industry average of 18%.
Above you can see how the current ROCE for Temple & Webster Group compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our 
.
We're glad to see that ROCE is heading in the right direction, even if it is still low at the moment. Over the last five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 7.5%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 807%. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.
On a related note, the company's ratio of current liabilities to total assets has decreased to 37%, which basically reduces it's funding from the likes of short-term creditors or suppliers. So this improvement in ROCE has come from the business' underlying economics, which is great to see.
All in all, it's terrific to see that Temple & Webster Group is reaping the rewards from prior investments and is growing its capital base. And a remarkable 768% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Temple & Webster Group can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.
If you'd like to know about the risks facing Temple & Webster Group, we've discovered 
 that you should be aware of.

Temple & Webster Group (ASX:TPW) shareholders have earned a 55% CAGR over the last five years 2024-03-26T20:01:44.000Z

We think all investors should try to buy and hold high quality multi-year winners. And highest quality companies can see their share prices grow by huge amounts. To wit, the 
 (
) share price has soared 793% over five years. And this is just one example of the epic gains achieved by some long term investors. On top of that, the share price is up 49% in about a quarter. We love happy stories like this one. The company should be really proud of that performance!
So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns.
There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.
During five years of share price growth, Temple & Webster Group achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 15% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 55% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth. This favorable sentiment is reflected in its (fairly optimistic) P/E ratio of 178.39.
You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).
We like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. This 
 interactive report on Temple & Webster Group's 
 is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.
We're pleased to report that Temple & Webster Group shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 276% over one year. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 55% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

With 56% institutional ownership, Temple & Webster Group Ltd (ASX:TPW) is a favorite amongst the big guns 2024-04-25T01:07:53.000Z

A look at the shareholders of Temple & Webster Group Ltd (
) can tell us which group is most powerful. With 56% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.
Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.
Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Temple & Webster Group, beginning with the chart below.
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
We can see that Temple & Webster Group does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Temple & Webster Group's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. It looks like hedge funds own 12% of Temple & Webster Group shares. That catches my attention because hedge funds sometimes try to influence management, or bring about changes that will create near term value for shareholders. Kinderhook Partners, LLC is currently the company's largest shareholder with 12% of shares outstanding. With 12% and 8.2% of the shares outstanding respectively, Australian Super Pty Ltd and Netwealth Investments Ltd. are the second and third largest shareholders.
We also observed that the top 7 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.
While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.
I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.
It seems insiders own a significant proportion of Temple & Webster Group Ltd. Insiders have a AU$175m stake in this AU$1.4b business. It is great to see insiders so invested in the business. It might be worth checking 
With a 12% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Temple & Webster Group. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.
It seems that Private Companies own 6.8%, of the Temple & Webster Group stock. It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company.
It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Temple & Webster Group better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks for example - Temple & Webster Group has 
 we think you should be aware of.
But ultimately 
, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at

Are Temple & Webster Group Ltd's (ASX:TPW) Fundamentals Good Enough to Warrant Buying Given The Stock's Recent Weakness? 2024-05-28T22:28:56.000Z

With its stock down 20% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard Temple & Webster Group (ASX:TPW). However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. Specifically, we decided to study 
 ROE in this article.
Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Temple & Webster Group is:
7.9% = AU$8.6m ÷ AU$108m (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).
The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every A$1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of A$0.08.
We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or "retain", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.
On the face of it, Temple & Webster Group's ROE is not much to talk about. We then compared the company's ROE to the broader industry and were disappointed to see that the ROE is lower than the industry average of 17%. Temple & Webster Group was still able to see a decent net income growth of 6.6% over the past five years. So, the growth in the company's earnings could probably have been caused by other variables. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.
As a next step, we compared Temple & Webster Group's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 18% in the same period.
Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is Temple & Webster Group fairly valued compared to other companies? These 
 might help you decide.
Given that Temple & Webster Group doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.
Overall, we feel that Temple & Webster Group certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Specifically, its fairly high earnings growth number, which no doubt was backed by the company's high earnings retention. Still, the low ROE means that all that reinvestment is not reaping a lot of benefit to the investors. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

However, its forecasted Return on Equity of 19.6% suggests moderate efficiency in generating profits from shareholders' equity.

With 54% ownership, Temple & Webster Group Ltd (ASX:TPW) boasts of strong institutional backing 2023-11-17T00:30:29.000Z

To get a sense of who is truly in control of Temple & Webster Group Ltd (
), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 54% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.
Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Temple & Webster Group.
Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.
We can see that Temple & Webster Group does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Temple & Webster Group's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Our data indicates that hedge funds own 12% of Temple & Webster Group. That's interesting, because hedge funds can be quite active and activist. Many look for medium term catalysts that will drive the share price higher. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Kinderhook Partners, LLC with 12% of shares outstanding. With 12% and 8.0% of the shares outstanding respectively, Australian Super Pty Ltd and Netwealth Investments Ltd. are the second and third largest shareholders. Furthermore, CEO Mark Coulter is the owner of 0.6% of the company's shares.
We also observed that the top 7 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.
While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
Our most recent data indicates that insiders own a reasonable proportion of Temple & Webster Group Ltd. Insiders have a AU$106m stake in this AU$819m business. We would say this shows alignment with shareholders, but it is worth noting that the company is still quite small; some insiders may have founded the business. You can 
With a 15% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Temple & Webster Group. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.
We can see that Private Companies own 6.6%, of the shares on issue. It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company.
It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Temple & Webster Group better, we need to consider many other factors.

Temple & Webster Group Ltd's (ASX:TPW) Stock Has Seen Strong Momentum: Does That Call For Deeper Study Of Its Financial Prospects? 2023-12-13T20:59:40.000Z

Most readers would already be aware that Temple & Webster Group's (ASX:TPW) stock increased significantly by 32% over the past three months. As most would know, fundamentals are what usually guide market price movements over the long-term, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. Particularly, we will be paying attention to 
 ROE today.
Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.
The 
 is:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Temple & Webster Group is:
7.7% = AU$8.3m ÷ AU$108m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).
The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every A$1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn A$0.08 in profit.
We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or "retain", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.
On the face of it, Temple & Webster Group's ROE is not much to talk about. We then compared the company's ROE to the broader industry and were disappointed to see that the ROE is lower than the industry average of 20%. Although, we can see that Temple & Webster Group saw a modest net income growth of 19% over the past five years. So, there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.
As a next step, we compared Temple & Webster Group's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 20% in the same period.
Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. If you're wondering about Temple & Webster Group's's valuation, check out 
, as compared to its industry.
Temple & Webster Group doesn't pay any dividend currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This definitely contributes to the decent earnings growth number that we discussed above.
On the whole, we do feel that Temple & Webster Group has some positive attributes. Even in spite of the low rate of return, the company has posted impressive earnings growth as a result of reinvesting heavily into its business. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

Temple & Webster Group Insiders Placed Bullish Bets Worth AU$9.87m 2024-01-05T00:59:19.000Z

Multiple insiders secured a larger position in 
 (ASX:TPW) shares over the last 12 months. This is reassuring as this suggests that insiders have increased optimism about the company's prospects.
Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.
Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by insider Angela Riley for AU$3.6m worth of shares, at about AU$3.62 per share. Although we like to see insider buying, we note that this large purchase was at significantly below the recent price of AU$8.70. While it does suggest insiders consider the stock undervalued at lower prices, this transaction doesn't tell us much about what they think of current prices.
While Temple & Webster Group insiders bought shares during the last year, they didn't sell. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!
There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do 
 want to miss this 
 
Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Insiders own 13% of Temple & Webster Group shares, worth about AU$139m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.
The fact that there have been no Temple & Webster Group insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. On a brighter note, the transactions over the last year are encouraging. It would be great to see more insider buying, but overall it seems like Temple & Webster Group insiders are reasonably well aligned (owning significant chunk of the company's shares) and optimistic for the future. If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this

Temple & Webster Group Ltd's (ASX:TPW) Intrinsic Value Is Potentially 96% Above Its Share Price 2024-02-14T20:48:33.000Z

In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Temple & Webster Group Ltd (
) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.
Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the 
.
We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:
 = AU$612m
After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.8%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$178m× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.8%– 2.2%) = AU$3.9b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$3.9b÷ ( 1 + 6.8%)
= AU$2.0b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is AU$2.6b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of AU$11.3, the company appears quite undervalued at a 49% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.
The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Temple & Webster Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.010. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to "what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

Temple & Webster Group (ASX:TPW) Is Experiencing Growth In Returns On Capital 2024-03-06T03:23:16.000Z

If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing 
 on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's 
 of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So on that note, 
 (
) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.
Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Temple & Webster Group:
0.075 = AU$9.8m ÷ (AU$206m - AU$75m) 
.
Therefore, 
 Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Specialty Retail industry average of 18%.
Above you can see how the current ROCE for Temple & Webster Group compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our 
.
We're glad to see that ROCE is heading in the right direction, even if it is still low at the moment. Over the last five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 7.5%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 807%. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.
On a related note, the company's ratio of current liabilities to total assets has decreased to 37%, which basically reduces it's funding from the likes of short-term creditors or suppliers. So this improvement in ROCE has come from the business' underlying economics, which is great to see.
All in all, it's terrific to see that Temple & Webster Group is reaping the rewards from prior investments and is growing its capital base. And a remarkable 768% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Temple & Webster Group can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.
If you'd like to know about the risks facing Temple & Webster Group, we've discovered 
 that you should be aware of.
While Temple & Webster Group may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity. Check out this

Temple & Webster Group (ASX:TPW) shareholders have earned a 55% CAGR over the last five years 2024-03-26T20:01:44.000Z

We think all investors should try to buy and hold high quality multi-year winners. And highest quality companies can see their share prices grow by huge amounts. To wit, the 
 (
) share price has soared 793% over five years. And this is just one example of the epic gains achieved by some long term investors. On top of that, the share price is up 49% in about a quarter. We love happy stories like this one. The company should be really proud of that performance!
So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns.
There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.
During five years of share price growth, Temple & Webster Group achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 15% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 55% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth. This favorable sentiment is reflected in its (fairly optimistic) P/E ratio of 178.39.
You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).
We like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. This 
 interactive report on Temple & Webster Group's 
 is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.
We're pleased to report that Temple & Webster Group shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 276% over one year. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 55% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified

With 56% institutional ownership, Temple & Webster Group Ltd (ASX:TPW) is a favorite amongst the big guns 2024-04-25T01:07:53.000Z

A look at the shareholders of Temple & Webster Group Ltd (
) can tell us which group is most powerful. With 56% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.
Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.
Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Temple & Webster Group, beginning with the chart below.
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
We can see that Temple & Webster Group does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Temple & Webster Group's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. It looks like hedge funds own 12% of Temple & Webster Group shares. That catches my attention because hedge funds sometimes try to influence management, or bring about changes that will create near term value for shareholders. Kinderhook Partners, LLC is currently the company's largest shareholder with 12% of shares outstanding. With 12% and 8.2% of the shares outstanding respectively, Australian Super Pty Ltd and Netwealth Investments Ltd. are the second and third largest shareholders.
We also observed that the top 7 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.
While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.
I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.
It seems insiders own a significant proportion of Temple & Webster Group Ltd. Insiders have a AU$175m stake in this AU$1.4b business. It is great to see insiders so invested in the business. It might be worth checking 
With a 12% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Temple & Webster Group. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.
It seems that Private Companies own 6.8%, of the Temple & Webster Group stock. It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company.
It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Temple & Webster Group better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks for example - Temple & Webster Group has 
 we think you should be aware of.
But ultimately 
, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at

Top Insider-Owned Growth Stocks In Australia For May 2024 2024-05-08T06:29:58.000Z

We're going to check out a few of the best picks from our screener tool.
 ★★★★★★

However, its Return on Equity is expected to remain low at 14.2%, indicating potential challenges in efficiency or profitability ahead.
================================================================================

Are Temple & Webster Group Ltd's (ASX:TPW) Fundamentals Good Enough to Warrant Buying Given The Stock's Recent Weakness? 2024-05-28T22:28:56.000Z

With its stock down 20% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard Temple & Webster Group (ASX:TPW). However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. Specifically, we decided to study 
 ROE in this article.
Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Temple & Webster Group is:
7.9% = AU$8.6m ÷ AU$108m (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).
The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every A$1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of A$0.08.
We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or "retain", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.
On the face of it, Temple & Webster Group's ROE is not much to talk about. We then compared the company's ROE to the broader industry and were disappointed to see that the ROE is lower than the industry average of 17%. Temple & Webster Group was still able to see a decent net income growth of 6.6% over the past five years. So, the growth in the company's earnings could probably have been caused by other variables. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.
As a next step, we compared Temple & Webster Group's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 18% in the same period.
Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is Temple & Webster Group fairly valued compared to other companies? These 
 might help you decide.
Given that Temple & Webster Group doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.
Overall, we feel that Temple & Webster Group certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Specifically, its fairly high earnings growth number, which no doubt was backed by the company's high earnings retention. Still, the low ROE means that all that reinvestment is not reaping a lot of benefit to the investors. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

The company's earnings are expected to grow by 25.84% annually, outpacing the Australian market forecast of 13.9%. While its revenue growth at 5.8% yearly is modest compared to high-growth benchmarks, it still exceeds the market average of 5.3%. Recent insider activities reflect confidence as more shares were bought than sold in the last three months. However, challenges include a dividend coverage issue and interest payments not well covered by earnings.
 ★★★★☆☆
 Technology One Limited is a company that develops, markets, sells, implements, and supports integrated enterprise business software solutions both in Australia and internationally, with a market capitalization of approximately A$5.87 billion.

 12.9%
Temple & Webster is set to grow robustly with earnings and revenue forecasts outpacing the Australian market significantly. Expected annual growth rates are 35.08% for earnings and 21.2% for revenue. Despite high insider ownership often signaling confidence, recent buyback activities, including a plan to repurchase shares worth A$30 million, suggest a strategic push to enhance shareholder value rather than direct insider buying or selling trends. However, its forecasted Return on Equity of 19.6% suggests moderate efficiency in generating profits from shareholders' equity.
