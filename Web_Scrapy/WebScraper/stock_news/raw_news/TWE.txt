Does The Market Have A Low Tolerance For Treasury Wine Estates Limited's (ASX:TWE) Mixed Fundamentals?

It is hard to get excited after looking at Treasury Wine Estates' (ASX:TWE) recent performance, when its stock has declined 2.4% over the past month. It is possible that the markets have ignored the company's differing financials and decided to lean-in to the negative sentiment. Stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, and therefore we decided to pay more attention to the company's financial performance. Particularly, we will be paying attention to 
 ROE today.
Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.
The 
 is:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Treasury Wine Estates is:
6.6% = AU$254m ÷ AU$3.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).
The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every A$1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn A$0.07 in profit.
Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or "retains" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.
At first glance, Treasury Wine Estates' ROE doesn't look very promising. However, the fact that the company's ROE is higher than the average industry ROE of 2.8%, is definitely interesting. But then again, seeing that Treasury Wine Estates' net income shrunk at a rate of 9.1% in the past five years, makes us think again. Bear in mind, the company does have a slightly low ROE. It is just that the industry ROE is lower. Therefore, the decline in earnings could also be the result of this.
So, as a next step, we compared Treasury Wine Estates' performance against the industry and were disappointed to discover that while the company has been shrinking its earnings, the industry has been growing its earnings at a rate of 14% over the last few years.
Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for TWE? You can find out in
Treasury Wine Estates' declining earnings is not surprising given how the company is spending most of its profits in paying dividends, judging by its three-year median payout ratio of 84% (or a retention ratio of 16%). With only a little being reinvested into the business, earnings growth would obviously be low or non-existent. You can see the 2 risks we have identified for Treasury Wine Estates by visiting our 
 for free 
Additionally, Treasury Wine Estates has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 68%. Regardless, the future ROE for Treasury Wine Estates is predicted to rise to 11% despite there being not much change expected in its payout ratio.
In total, we're a bit ambivalent about Treasury Wine Estates' performance. On the one hand, the company does have a decent rate of return, however, its earnings growth number is quite disappointing and as discussed earlier, the low retained earnings is hampering the growth. Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement.

Australia's Treasury Wine tests tricky US market with $900 million purchase

By Byron Kaye, Roushni Nair and Peter Hobson
(Reuters) -Top Australian wine producer Treasury Wine Estates has agreed to a $900 million buyout of U.S. rival DAOU Vineyards, increasing its exposure to a market that it has long struggled to dominate amid uncertainty about stalled exports to China.
Treasury, owner of the Penfolds and Wolf Blass labels, said it was buying the Paso Robles, California, private company to fill a gap in its luxury offering, defined as bottles retailing for $20 to $40.
The deal builds on the Australian firm's plan to take its portfolio upmarket, where it said demand and margins are higher, but puts Treasury deeper into a geographic segment that has proven difficult even as it adjusts its product offer.
A decade ago, Treasury destroyed thousands of bottles of low-end wine it could not sell in the U.S. after aggressive expansion. In 2021, as China imposed crippling tariffs, Treasury paid $315 million for California's Frank Family Vineyards, calling it a luxury brand, but profit from Treasury's U.S. business declined in the year to June 2023.
"I'm not accountable for the last 20 years. I'm accountable for the last three," said Treasury CEO Tim Ford, who started in the role in 2020, on an analyst call.
Treasury is going ahead with expansion in the U.S. even as it awaits a review recently announced by China into the tariffs which stopped that country being Treasury's biggest market.
"I don't see why we would wait for China," Ford said on the call.
"If China does come back at the end of this review process, this is just going to open up a new opportunity," he said.
Shares of Treasury were in a trading halt as the company asked investors to buy A$825 million worth of new shares at a 10.7% discount to the stock's last closing price, to help fund the deal. But analysts expressed caution about the decision given Treasury's record in the U.S.
"The concern investors will have is that TWE Americas has been underperforming in recent times," E&P Capital analyst Philip Kimber said in a client note.
Treasury expects the deal - the second-largest by an Australian company of a U.S. entity this year, showed data from Dealogic - to close by the end of 2023 and contribute earnings before interest and taxes of $23 million to $25 million in the second half of 2024.

Australia's Treasury Wine surges on hopes of China revival

By Archishma Iyer
(Reuters) -Australia's Treasury Wine Estates said on Monday it is well placed to rebuild its business in China, sending its shares up more than 5%, should Beijing's tariffs on Australian wine be removed as signalled by the two countries on the weekend.
The Australian government, which is repairing economic ties with Asia's largest economy after a number of disputes, said on Sunday China had agreed to an expedited review of tariffs on Australian wine, expected to take up to five months.
"Should tariffs be removed, these measures will be implemented sustainably and with the aim of growing the business in China," Treasury Wine, the world's biggest standalone winemaker, said in a statement.
Treasury Wine used to make one-third of its profit in China but lost most of that business when Beijing imposed tariffs on Australian wine in 2021, after Canberra called for an inquiry into the origins of COVID-19.
"If the tariffs are removed, we see this as a significant positive for the Australian wine export industry and specifically Treasury Wine," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a research note.
Measures for reviving its China business would include shifting a portion of Penfolds Luxury from other markets back to China and rebuilding distribution for the Penfolds Australian entry-level luxury portfolios, the company said.
Treasury's shares rose as much as 5.3%, one of the highest gainers on the Australian stock exchange on Monday, and last traded up 2% against a broader market that was down 0.9%.
Treasury recently said it expected its operating profit in the year to June 2024 to be weighted towards the second half, reflecting the planned phasing of Penfolds shipments to retain flexibility given a potential future review of tariffs.

Investors five-year losses continue as Treasury Wine Estates (ASX:TWE) dips a further 3.7% this week, earnings continue to decline

For many, the main point of investing is to generate higher returns than the overall market. But every investor is virtually certain to have both over-performing and under-performing stocks. At this point some shareholders may be questioning their investment in 
 (
), since the last five years saw the share price fall 29%.
After losing 3.7% this past week, it's worth investigating the company's fundamentals to see what we can infer from past performance.
To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.
During the five years over which the share price declined, Treasury Wine Estates' earnings per share (EPS) dropped by 6.6% each year. This change in EPS is remarkably close to the 7% average annual decrease in the share price. This implies that the market has had a fairly steady view of the stock. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.
You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).
It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our 
 
.
As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Treasury Wine Estates the TSR over the last 5 years was -19%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the 
 shareholder return.
While the broader market gained around 6.2% in the last year, Treasury Wine Estates shareholders lost 7.1% (even including dividends). However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 4% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Treasury Wine Estates better, we need to consider many other factors. Even so, be aware that 
, and 1 of those is a bit unpleasant...

Australian winemaker just paid $1 billion for a California winery owned by two brothers who started making wine in their garage

One of the world’s largest winemakers, Australia’s Treasury Wine Estates (TWE), has acquired a California vineyard for $1 billion that it hopes to make the linchpin in its efforts to enter the U.S. premium market.
Daou Vineyards is owned by two Lebanese American brothers who started with just a one-acre vineyard, making wine in their garage. It has grown from a scrappy upstart to what Ben Dollard, president of Treasury Americas, said would have a “cornerstone role within our portfolio.”
Over the past few years TWE has been clear that it sees pricier, higher-quality wines as the future of its business.
“TWE’s ambition is clear: to become the world's most admired premium wine company,” the company said in a press release.
Daou was founded by Georges and Daniel Daou, who fled Lebanon during the county’s civil war in the 1970s, according to the company’s website. The family relocated to France, where the two brothers developed an interest in winemaking, eventually making their way to San Diego. There, the two brothers started a network technology company, aptly named Daou Systems, that was acquired by technology company Proxicom in 2005 in a deal estimated to be worth 
. After the sale, Daniel Daou, who had long been obsessed with wine, bought a property in Paso Robles, Calif., about three hours south of San Francisco, with his brother Georges joining him as a business partner. Daou now has a roughly 400-acre vineyard.
When Dollard met with the Daous, he was particularly struck with how well they understood their consumers, he told 
. Meanwhile the Daous were especially eager to grow their business beyond the U.S. “One of the big opportunities they see for the brand is international expansion, and that's certainly a material capability of us,” Dollard added.
Daou, which grows Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, and Semillon grapes, has bottles that sell for as high as $285 on the popular wine app 
. A magnum of Daou’s 2020 Merlot sells for $590 on the vineyard’s website.
The acquisition includes $900 million in upfront payments, with another $100 million if certain performance targets are met.
TWE, which had about $1.6 billion in annual revenue, has had its sights set on the premium market for several years, as American consumers become increasingly interested in wine.
"We’re seeing, across the wine category, the appetite and desire for consumers to explore and expand their knowledge and experience with wine,” Dollard says. “With that comes an appetite to explore in the luxury space.”
In fiscal 2023, 85% of TWE's sales came from its premium and luxury brands, a two-percentage-point increase compared to the year before.
TWE already owns several wineries in the U.S. including Stag’s Leap, Acacia Winery, and Beringer Vineyards, the oldest continuously operating vineyard in the Napa Valley. Expanding further into the American market has been a top priority for TWE ever since China imposed 
 on Australian wine imports. That tariff came after Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison called for an 
 into the origins of COVID-19, a probe that China called “political games.” In March 2021, Chinese authorities retaliated by imposing a five-year tariff that went up to 218% for Australian wines that 
 Australia’s wine business. Imports to China fell 97% the first year.
"I don't see why we would wait for China," CEO Tim Ford told investors earlier this year.
Recent reports indicate the Australian government is 
 Chinese officials will lift tariffs on wine imports, which would pave the way for TWE to return to the world’s second-largest economy. "Daou, particularly because we see Chinese market as an opportunity, continues to open doors for us, and and that's exactly why we get excited," Dollard says.

Is Treasury Wine Estates Limited (ASX:TWE) Trading At A 47% Discount?

Does the January share price for Treasury Wine Estates Limited (ASX:TWE) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.
We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the 
.
We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:
 = AU$3.6b
The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.1%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$880m× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.1%– 2.1%) = AU$22b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$22b÷ ( 1 + 6.1%)
= AU$12b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is AU$16b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of AU$10.5, the company appears quite undervalued at a 47% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.
Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Treasury Wine Estates as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For Treasury Wine Estates, we've compiled three relevant items you should assess:

Treasury Wine says it is ready to ship Australian bottles to China

By Poonam Behura and Peter Hobson
(Reuters) -Shares of Treasury Wine Estates shot to a three-month high on Thursday after the company, one of the world's biggest wine makers, said core profit met expectations and it was ready to resume shipping Australian wine into China.
China accounted for one-third of Treasury's profit before Beijing imposed tariffs on Australian wine in 2020, effectively ending shipments.
However, relations between Canberra and Beijing have improved and the Australian government and wine industry expect the tariffs to lift in the coming weeks.
"We expect a decision and therefore a path forward by the end of March," Treasury CEO Tim Ford said on a conference call with analysts.
"We are both well prepared and well placed to reestablish our Australian country of origin portfolio in China," he said, adding that China was a "significant growth opportunity" for Treasury's higher-priced Penfolds division.
Melbourne-based Treasury, whose brands range from Wolf Blass and Lindeman's to Beringer and DAOU, has continued to ship wine made outside Australia to China and said it has more than 120 staff there.
Treasury produces wine mainly in Australia but also in the United States, New Zealand, France and Italy.
If Beijing did lift tariffs, Ford said Treasury would reallocate some of its Penfolds Bin and Icon wines from other global markets to China and raise prices globally on some of its more expensive Penfolds bottles.
The company's earnings before interest and taxes (EBITS) for first-half period ended Dec. 31 were A$289.8 million ($188.25 million), in line with Visible Alpha's consensus estimate.
Weakness in U.S. sales led to a 13% fall in profit to A$166.7 million but beat Jefferies's estimate of A$123 million.
"Some feared (the results) could have been worse than what was reported at a headline EBITS level," Citi analysts said in a note.
Treasury now expects stronger results in the second half and reiterated forecast for mid- to high-single-digit organic EBITS growth in 2024.
The company declared an interim dividend of 17 Australian cents per share, in line with consensus view, but below the 18 Australian cents it paid last year.
Treasury's shares were up nearly 3% at 0330 GMT having earlier been up more than 5% to reach their highest levels since Nov. 8. ($1 = 1.5394 Australian dollars)

It Might Not Be A Great Idea To Buy Treasury Wine Estates Limited (ASX:TWE) For Its Next Dividend

Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see 
 (
) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Thus, you can purchase Treasury Wine Estates' shares before the 6th of March in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 3rd of April.
The company's next dividend payment will be AU$0.17 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of AU$0.34 per share. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Treasury Wine Estates has a trailing yield of approximately 2.8% on its current stock price of AU$12.35. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing.
If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Last year, Treasury Wine Estates paid out 107% of its income as dividends, which is above a level that we're comfortable with, especially if the company needs to reinvest in its business. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. It paid out an unsustainably high 204% of its free cash flow as dividends over the past 12 months, which is worrying. Unless there were something in the business we're not grasping, this could signal a risk that the dividend may have to be cut in the future.
Cash is slightly more important than profit from a dividend perspective, but given Treasury Wine Estates's payouts were not well covered by either earnings or cash flow, we would be concerned about the sustainability of this dividend.
Click 
Companies with falling earnings are riskier for dividend shareholders. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. Treasury Wine Estates's earnings per share have fallen at approximately 10% a year over the previous five years. Such a sharp decline casts doubt on the future sustainability of the dividend.
Treasury Wine Estates also issued more than 5% of its market cap in new stock during the past year, which we feel is likely to hurt its dividend prospects in the long run. It's hard to grow dividends per share when a company keeps creating new shares.
The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, Treasury Wine Estates has increased its dividend at approximately 10% a year on average. The only way to pay higher dividends when earnings are shrinking is either to pay out a larger percentage of profits, spend cash from the balance sheet, or borrow the money. Treasury Wine Estates is already paying out 107% of its profits, and with shrinking earnings we think it's unlikely that this dividend will grow quickly in the future.
Has Treasury Wine Estates got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Not only are earnings per share declining, but Treasury Wine Estates is paying out an uncomfortably high percentage of both its earnings and cashflow to shareholders as dividends. This is a clearly suboptimal combination that usually suggests the dividend is at risk of being cut. If not now, then perhaps in the future. With the way things are shaping up from a dividend perspective, we'd be inclined to steer clear of Treasury Wine Estates.
So if you're still interested in Treasury Wine Estates despite it's poor dividend qualities, you should be well informed on some of the risks facing this stock. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 
 (of which 1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) you should know about.
If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend

Does Treasury Wine Estates Limited's (ASX:TWE) Weak Fundamentals Mean That The Market Could Correct Its Share Price?

Most readers would already be aware that Treasury Wine Estates' (ASX:TWE) stock increased significantly by 13% over the past three months. We, however wanted to have a closer look at its key financial indicators as the markets usually pay for long-term fundamentals, and in this case, they don't look very promising. In this article, we decided to focus on 
 ROE.
Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Treasury Wine Estates is:
4.9% = AU$233m ÷ AU$4.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).
The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each A$1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made A$0.05 in profit.
Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or "retains", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
At first glance, Treasury Wine Estates' ROE doesn't look very promising. Next, when compared to the average industry ROE of 12%, the company's ROE leaves us feeling even less enthusiastic. For this reason, Treasury Wine Estates' five year net income decline of 8.9% is not surprising given its lower ROE. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. Such as - low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.
However, when we compared Treasury Wine Estates' growth with the industry we found that while the company's earnings have been shrinking, the industry has seen an earnings growth of 10% in the same period. This is quite worrisome.
The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for TWE? You can find out in
With a high three-year median payout ratio of 84% (implying that 16% of the profits are retained), most of Treasury Wine Estates' profits are being paid to shareholders, which explains the company's shrinking earnings. With only a little being reinvested into the business, earnings growth would obviously be low or non-existent. You can see the 4 risks we have identified for Treasury Wine Estates by visiting our 
 for free 
Additionally, Treasury Wine Estates has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 68% of its profits over the next three years. However, Treasury Wine Estates' ROE is predicted to rise to 12% despite there being no anticipated change in its payout ratio.
In total, we would have a hard think before deciding on any investment action concerning Treasury Wine Estates. Because the company is not reinvesting much into the business, and given the low ROE, it's not surprising to see the lack or absence of growth in its earnings. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future.

Treasury Wine to resume distribution in China after import tariffs end

(Reuters) - Treasury Wine Estates will resume the distribution of some of its products in China, it said on Thursday, after the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said it would remove tariffs on Australian wine imports from March 29.
Treasury Wine will use partnerships with customers in China to distribute its Penfolds entry-level Australian origin portfolio as well as its Premium Brands Australian-sourced priority portfolio, it said.
In addition to resuming distribution, it plans to expand sales and increase its marketing resources and brand investment in China. It said, however, the incremental earnings from the Chinese sales of its wines would be minimal through the remainder of fiscal 2024.
Sales diminished after tariffs of up to 218.4% were first imposed in March 2021 for a period of five years along with other trade barriers on Australian commodities when ties soured after Canberra called for an investigation into the origins of COVID-19.
Ties between Canberra and Beijing have improved significantly since last year, leading to China steadily lifting trade barriers on Australian goods including barley and coal.

Painful week for individual investors invested in Treasury Wine Estates Limited (ASX:TWE) after 7.3% drop, institutions also suffered losses

A look at the shareholders of Treasury Wine Estates Limited (
) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that individual investors own the lion's share in the company with 60% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.
Following a 7.3% decrease in the stock price last week, individual investors suffered the most losses, but institutions who own 40% stock also took a hit.
Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Treasury Wine Estates.
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
Treasury Wine Estates already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Treasury Wine Estates' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
Treasury Wine Estates is not owned by hedge funds. Capital Research and Management Company is currently the largest shareholder, with 7.5% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 6.1% and 5.6%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.
A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.
Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.
The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.
Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.
Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Treasury Wine Estates Limited in their own names. It is a pretty big company, so it would be possible for board members to own a meaningful interest in the company, without owning much of a proportional interest. In this case, they own around AU$15m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking 
The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a substantial 60% stake in Treasury Wine Estates, suggesting it is a fairly popular stock. This size of ownership gives investors from the general public some collective power. They can and probably do influence decisions on executive compensation, dividend policies and proposed business acquisitions.
It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Treasury Wine Estates better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified 
 that you should be aware of.
If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check

The five-year shareholder returns and company earnings persist lower as Treasury Wine Estates (ASX:TWE) stock falls a further 5.1% in past week

In order to justify the effort of selecting individual stocks, it's worth striving to beat the returns from a market index fund. But the main game is to find enough winners to more than offset the losers So we wouldn't blame long term 
 (
) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 24% over a half decade. Unfortunately the share price momentum is still quite negative, with prices down 11% in thirty days.
After losing 5.1% this past week, it's worth investigating the company's fundamentals to see what we can infer from past performance.
While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).
Looking back five years, both Treasury Wine Estates' share price and EPS declined; the latter at a rate of 12% per year. The share price decline of 5% per year isn't as bad as the EPS decline. So investors might expect EPS to bounce back -- or they may have previously foreseen the EPS decline.
The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).
It's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Treasury Wine Estates' 
.
As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Treasury Wine Estates' TSR for the last 5 years was -13%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the 
 shareholder return.
While the broader market gained around 13% in the last year, Treasury Wine Estates shareholders lost 11% (even including dividends). Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 2% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered 
 (1 is potentially serious!) that you should be aware of before investing here.

Treasury Wine Estates shuts down Chapel Down speculation

Australia’s Treasury Wine Estates has brushed off a media report it is looking to buy English wine producer Chapel Down.
Last month, Chapel Down said it would consider a sale of the company to find new ways to build long-term growth.
UK newspaper 
 reported Treasury Wine Estates and Accolade Wines were interested in making moves for Chapel Down.
However, a spokesperson for Treasury Wine Estates told 
 it “is not participating in the sale of Chapel Down wines”.
Accolade had not returned a request for comment at the time of writing.
Last week, the owner of Accolade 
 from Pernod Ricard. The deal will include Pernod Ricard wine brands such as Jacob’s Creek, Brancott Estate and Campo Viejo, as well as seven wineries. The Accolade portfolio includes Hardys, Echo Falls and Jam Shed.
In 2023, Chapel Down booked a 15% rise in net sales to £17.2m ($22.2m).
Operating profits were up 81% to £2.3m, while adjusted EBITDA increased 87% at £5.4m, helped by “profitable trading” and an adjustment to grape prices following a record 2023 harvest. The winemaker said the year had been “profitable at all levels”.
Chapel Down harvested 3,811 tonnes of grapes, its highest amount to date. These made up for around 3.4 million bottles. More than two million of these were to be used in its sparkling wines. This figure was an 86% increase on 2022 (2,050 tonnes) and 75% higher than the company’s 2018 record (2,173 tonnes).
In a 
 25 June, the group said it would “consider all alternatives” including “a sale of the company” as it conducted “a strategic review of the options” with an aim to boost profits,
Chapel Down also said it intends to examine “investment from existing shareholders, investment from new shareholders… and other relevant transactions”.
The move comes as the group looks to support future investments in new vineyards and a purpose-built winery, due to be completed by the 2026 harvest. It also plans to inject an unknown sum into developing its brand home in Tenterden, Kent.
Treasury Wine Estates 
 last month, merging a team focused on revenue growth into its premium-brands division. It has been reshaping its portfolio over the last year, as the company puts more emphasis on its “premium” and “luxury” ranges.
In the opening six months of its fiscal 2024, the comoany posted sales of A$1.31bn ($871.2m) compared to A$1.31bn a year ago. Net income was A$166.7m, down 11.4%.
The group’s earnings before interest, tax, SGARA and material items (EBITS) dropped 5.8% to A$289.8m, driven by Treasury Americas and Treasury Premium Brands, which featured a 17.5% and 3.2% decline in EBITS respectively.

Treasury Wine Estates moves revenue-growth team into premium-brands division

Australia's Treasury Wine Estates (TWE) has merged a new team focussed on revenue growth into its premium-brands division as it looks to “unlock” growth for focus brands.
The Melbourne-headquartered group said the move would help “strengthen innovation” and deepen its engagement with customer partners and end consumers.
Its ‘global revenue growth’ team (GRG) established by the group’s global chief revenue growth officer Angus Liley in 2023. It was tasked with “driving” revenue opportunities by setting out growth plans for current and future global brands, as well as working on innovation and consumer intelligence.
Liley will now take over the TPB division as managing director from Peter Neilson. After 12 years at TWE, Neilson is leaving TWE to “pursue new career opportunities”.
The corporate structural and leadership changes at TWE will come into effect 1 July.
“When you consider our premium portfolio, this is a unique offering with an unrivalled global footprint and brands that resonate strongly with consumers,” TWE CEO Tim Ford said.
“Integrating our GRG capabilities within TPB, will enhance our ability to strengthen these brands, foster cutting-edge innovation and deepen our engagement with consumers and customer partners.”
TWE has been reshaping its portfolio over the last year, as the company puts more emphasis on its “premium” and “luxury” ranges.
Last year, Treasury Wine Estates announced 
 its “commercial” wine operation in Victoria amid pressure on sales of more mainstream wine in the country. At the time, the company said the decision to close its Karadoc winery had been made in light of rising costs and a decline in consumption of wine sold at below A$10 (then $6.70) a bottle.
The group has also made several plays for higher-priced wine brands.
In October, TWE acquired California’s 
 for $900m. The deal, which could rise to $1bn, will see the company take 100% of Daou Vineyards, including three wineries and 389 acres of vineyards across Paso Robles, and a winery and 22 acres of vines in San Luis Obispo.
A month later, 
 to expand its footprint in New Zealand with its purchase of a vineyard in Marlborough.
For the opening six months of its fiscal 2024, TWE reported sales of A$1.313bn compared to A$1.308bn a year ago. Net income was A$166.7m, down 11.4%.
The group’s earnings before interest, tax, SGARA and material items (EBITS) dropped 5.8% to A$289.8m, driven by Treasury Americas and Treasury Premium Brands, which featured a 17.5% and 3.2% decline in EBITS respectively.
Treasury Wine Estates slightly lowered its full-year guidance for its fiscal 2024, now estimating mid-to-high single-digit growth from a previous estimate of high single-digit growth.

Treasury Wine Estates automates barrel storage

Australia’s Treasury Wine Estates (TWE) has automated its barrel handling system at its winery in Barossa valley.
TWE's A$10m ($6.7m) investment included the installation and creation of a barrel management system, as well as automated washing and filling stations.
The “end-to-end” automated system includes nine driverless forklifts that rotate the barrels according to maturation stages. The group said the process runs for 24 hours, five days a week.
“We’ve seen improvements in safety, efficiency, and traceability in our barrel hall, with the team on site embracing the new way of working. The efficiency and precision of automated, sensor-based forklifts to transport the barrels lowers energy consumption compared to manual handling processes,” TWE director of supply technology Jodie Rowlands said.
The vintner said the automation will allow the winery to boost its red wine “handling capacity” to 125,000 barrels at the site. It handles 60,000 barrels of wine.
TWE opened its Barossa Valley facility in 2022, following a A$164m investment project.

Exploring Three ASX Stocks Estimated To Be Up To 41.4% Below Intrinsic Value

The Australian stock market has seen a recent dip, dropping 2.0% over the last week, yet it maintains a positive trajectory with a 6.1% increase over the past year and earnings expected to grow by 14% annually. In such a fluctuating environment, identifying stocks that are trading below their intrinsic value could present opportunities for investors looking for potential growth at reduced prices.
We'll examine a selection from our screener results
 Flight Centre Travel Group Limited operates as a travel retailer serving both leisure and corporate sectors across Australia, New Zealand, the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and internationally with a market capitalization of A$4.39 billion.
 The company generates revenue primarily through its leisure and corporate travel services, amounting to A$1.28 billion and A$1.06 billion respectively.
 19.7%
Flight Centre Travel Group is positioned intriguingly in the Australian market with its earnings expected to grow at 18.8% annually, outpacing the broader market's 13.7%. While its revenue growth forecast of 9.7% per year also exceeds the Australian market average of 5.4%, it doesn’t reach the high growth benchmark of over 20%. Additionally, a projected return on equity of 21.7% in three years suggests strong potential for efficient capital management.
 Lovisa Holdings Limited is a retailer specializing in fashion jewelry and accessories, with a market capitalization of approximately A$3.43 billion.
 The company generates its revenue primarily from the retail sale of fashion jewelry and accessories, totaling approximately A$654 million.
 32.6%
Lovisa Holdings, trading at A$32.15, is valued below its estimated fair value of A$47.67, indicating a significant undervaluation based on cash flows. Forecasted to grow earnings by 19.23% annually, Lovisa's projected growth outstrips the Australian market's 13.7%. Additionally, its revenue growth rate of 14.3% annually surpasses the market average of 5.4%. Despite these positives, its earnings growth does not meet the high-growth threshold of over 20% per year.
 Treasury Wine Estates Limited is a global wine company with operations across Australia, New Zealand, Asia, Europe, the UK, the Middle East, Africa, and the Americas, boasting a market capitalization of approximately A$9.73 billion.
 The company's revenue is primarily generated through three segments: Penfolds at A$893.30 million, Treasury Americas at A$825.40 million, and Treasury Premium Brands at A$768.30 million.
 41.4%
Treasury Wine Estates (TWE) is projected to outpace the Australian market with its revenue expected to increase by 10.1% annually, compared to the market's 5.4%. Earnings are also set to rise significantly at a rate of 22.5% per year over the next three years. However, challenges include a dividend coverage issue, as current payouts are not well supported by earnings or cash flows. Additionally, TWE has experienced shareholder dilution and declining profit margins year-over-year, alongside significant one-off items affecting financial results. Recently, TWE expanded its distribution in China through an exclusive agreement with Season Global Trading for its Penfolds Champagne series, potentially boosting future revenues.

Does The Market Have A Low Tolerance For Treasury Wine Estates Limited's (ASX:TWE) Mixed Fundamentals?

It is hard to get excited after looking at Treasury Wine Estates' (ASX:TWE) recent performance, when its stock has declined 2.4% over the past month. It is possible that the markets have ignored the company's differing financials and decided to lean-in to the negative sentiment. Stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, and therefore we decided to pay more attention to the company's financial performance. Particularly, we will be paying attention to 
 ROE today.
Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.
The 
 is:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Treasury Wine Estates is:
6.6% = AU$254m ÷ AU$3.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).
The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every A$1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn A$0.07 in profit.
Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or "retains" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.
At first glance, Treasury Wine Estates' ROE doesn't look very promising. However, the fact that the company's ROE is higher than the average industry ROE of 2.8%, is definitely interesting. But then again, seeing that Treasury Wine Estates' net income shrunk at a rate of 9.1% in the past five years, makes us think again. Bear in mind, the company does have a slightly low ROE. It is just that the industry ROE is lower. Therefore, the decline in earnings could also be the result of this.
So, as a next step, we compared Treasury Wine Estates' performance against the industry and were disappointed to discover that while the company has been shrinking its earnings, the industry has been growing its earnings at a rate of 14% over the last few years.
Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for TWE? You can find out in
Treasury Wine Estates' declining earnings is not surprising given how the company is spending most of its profits in paying dividends, judging by its three-year median payout ratio of 84% (or a retention ratio of 16%). With only a little being reinvested into the business, earnings growth would obviously be low or non-existent. You can see the 2 risks we have identified for Treasury Wine Estates by visiting our 
 for free 
Additionally, Treasury Wine Estates has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 68%. Regardless, the future ROE for Treasury Wine Estates is predicted to rise to 11% despite there being not much change expected in its payout ratio.
In total, we're a bit ambivalent about Treasury Wine Estates' performance. On the one hand, the company does have a decent rate of return, however, its earnings growth number is quite disappointing and as discussed earlier, the low retained earnings is hampering the growth. Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement.

Investors five-year losses continue as Treasury Wine Estates (ASX:TWE) dips a further 3.7% this week, earnings continue to decline

For many, the main point of investing is to generate higher returns than the overall market. But every investor is virtually certain to have both over-performing and under-performing stocks. At this point some shareholders may be questioning their investment in 
 (
), since the last five years saw the share price fall 29%.
After losing 3.7% this past week, it's worth investigating the company's fundamentals to see what we can infer from past performance.
To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.
During the five years over which the share price declined, Treasury Wine Estates' earnings per share (EPS) dropped by 6.6% each year. This change in EPS is remarkably close to the 7% average annual decrease in the share price. This implies that the market has had a fairly steady view of the stock. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.
You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).
It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our 
 
.
As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Treasury Wine Estates the TSR over the last 5 years was -19%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the 
 shareholder return.
While the broader market gained around 6.2% in the last year, Treasury Wine Estates shareholders lost 7.1% (even including dividends). However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 4% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Treasury Wine Estates better, we need to consider many other factors. Even so, be aware that 
, and 1 of those is a bit unpleasant...

Australia's Treasury Wine surges on hopes of China revival

By Archishma Iyer
(Reuters) -Australia's Treasury Wine Estates said on Monday it is well placed to rebuild its business in China, sending its shares up more than 5%, should Beijing's tariffs on Australian wine be removed as signalled by the two countries on the weekend.
The Australian government, which is repairing economic ties with Asia's largest economy after a number of disputes, said on Sunday China had agreed to an expedited review of tariffs on Australian wine, expected to take up to five months.
"Should tariffs be removed, these measures will be implemented sustainably and with the aim of growing the business in China," Treasury Wine, the world's biggest standalone winemaker, said in a statement.
Treasury Wine used to make one-third of its profit in China but lost most of that business when Beijing imposed tariffs on Australian wine in 2021, after Canberra called for an inquiry into the origins of COVID-19.
"If the tariffs are removed, we see this as a significant positive for the Australian wine export industry and specifically Treasury Wine," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a research note.
Measures for reviving its China business would include shifting a portion of Penfolds Luxury from other markets back to China and rebuilding distribution for the Penfolds Australian entry-level luxury portfolios, the company said.
Treasury's shares rose as much as 5.3%, one of the highest gainers on the Australian stock exchange on Monday, and last traded up 2% against a broader market that was down 0.9%.
Treasury recently said it expected its operating profit in the year to June 2024 to be weighted towards the second half, reflecting the planned phasing of Penfolds shipments to retain flexibility given a potential future review of tariffs.

Australian winemaker just paid $1 billion for a California winery owned by two brothers who started making wine in their garage

One of the world’s largest winemakers, Australia’s Treasury Wine Estates (TWE), has acquired a California vineyard for $1 billion that it hopes to make the linchpin in its efforts to enter the U.S. premium market.
Daou Vineyards is owned by two Lebanese American brothers who started with just a one-acre vineyard, making wine in their garage. It has grown from a scrappy upstart to what Ben Dollard, president of Treasury Americas, said would have a “cornerstone role within our portfolio.”
Over the past few years TWE has been clear that it sees pricier, higher-quality wines as the future of its business.
“TWE’s ambition is clear: to become the world's most admired premium wine company,” the company said in a press release.
Daou was founded by Georges and Daniel Daou, who fled Lebanon during the county’s civil war in the 1970s, according to the company’s website. The family relocated to France, where the two brothers developed an interest in winemaking, eventually making their way to San Diego. There, the two brothers started a network technology company, aptly named Daou Systems, that was acquired by technology company Proxicom in 2005 in a deal estimated to be worth 
. After the sale, Daniel Daou, who had long been obsessed with wine, bought a property in Paso Robles, Calif., about three hours south of San Francisco, with his brother Georges joining him as a business partner. Daou now has a roughly 400-acre vineyard.
When Dollard met with the Daous, he was particularly struck with how well they understood their consumers, he told 
. Meanwhile the Daous were especially eager to grow their business beyond the U.S. “One of the big opportunities they see for the brand is international expansion, and that's certainly a material capability of us,” Dollard added.
Daou, which grows Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, and Semillon grapes, has bottles that sell for as high as $285 on the popular wine app 
. A magnum of Daou’s 2020 Merlot sells for $590 on the vineyard’s website.
The acquisition includes $900 million in upfront payments, with another $100 million if certain performance targets are met.
TWE, which had about $1.6 billion in annual revenue, has had its sights set on the premium market for several years, as American consumers become increasingly interested in wine.
"We’re seeing, across the wine category, the appetite and desire for consumers to explore and expand their knowledge and experience with wine,” Dollard says. “With that comes an appetite to explore in the luxury space.”
In fiscal 2023, 85% of TWE's sales came from its premium and luxury brands, a two-percentage-point increase compared to the year before.
TWE already owns several wineries in the U.S. including Stag’s Leap, Acacia Winery, and Beringer Vineyards, the oldest continuously operating vineyard in the Napa Valley. Expanding further into the American market has been a top priority for TWE ever since China imposed 
 on Australian wine imports. That tariff came after Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison called for an 
 into the origins of COVID-19, a probe that China called “political games.” In March 2021, Chinese authorities retaliated by imposing a five-year tariff that went up to 218% for Australian wines that 
 Australia’s wine business. Imports to China fell 97% the first year.
"I don't see why we would wait for China," CEO Tim Ford told investors earlier this year.
Recent reports indicate the Australian government is 
 Chinese officials will lift tariffs on wine imports, which would pave the way for TWE to return to the world’s second-largest economy. "Daou, particularly because we see Chinese market as an opportunity, continues to open doors for us, and and that's exactly why we get excited," Dollard says.

Australia's Treasury Wine tests tricky US market with $900 million purchase

By Byron Kaye, Roushni Nair and Peter Hobson
(Reuters) -Top Australian wine producer Treasury Wine Estates has agreed to a $900 million buyout of U.S. rival DAOU Vineyards, increasing its exposure to a market that it has long struggled to dominate amid uncertainty about stalled exports to China.
Treasury, owner of the Penfolds and Wolf Blass labels, said it was buying the Paso Robles, California, private company to fill a gap in its luxury offering, defined as bottles retailing for $20 to $40.
The deal builds on the Australian firm's plan to take its portfolio upmarket, where it said demand and margins are higher, but puts Treasury deeper into a geographic segment that has proven difficult even as it adjusts its product offer.
A decade ago, Treasury destroyed thousands of bottles of low-end wine it could not sell in the U.S. after aggressive expansion. In 2021, as China imposed crippling tariffs, Treasury paid $315 million for California's Frank Family Vineyards, calling it a luxury brand, but profit from Treasury's U.S. business declined in the year to June 2023.
"I'm not accountable for the last 20 years. I'm accountable for the last three," said Treasury CEO Tim Ford, who started in the role in 2020, on an analyst call.
Treasury is going ahead with expansion in the U.S. even as it awaits a review recently announced by China into the tariffs which stopped that country being Treasury's biggest market.
"I don't see why we would wait for China," Ford said on the call.
"If China does come back at the end of this review process, this is just going to open up a new opportunity," he said.
Shares of Treasury were in a trading halt as the company asked investors to buy A$825 million worth of new shares at a 10.7% discount to the stock's last closing price, to help fund the deal. But analysts expressed caution about the decision given Treasury's record in the U.S.
"The concern investors will have is that TWE Americas has been underperforming in recent times," E&P Capital analyst Philip Kimber said in a client note.
Treasury expects the deal - the second-largest by an Australian company of a U.S. entity this year, showed data from Dealogic - to close by the end of 2023 and contribute earnings before interest and taxes of $23 million to $25 million in the second half of 2024.

Is Treasury Wine Estates Limited (ASX:TWE) Trading At A 47% Discount?

Does the January share price for Treasury Wine Estates Limited (ASX:TWE) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.
We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the 
.
We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:
 = AU$3.6b
The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.1%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$880m× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.1%– 2.1%) = AU$22b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$22b÷ ( 1 + 6.1%)
= AU$12b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is AU$16b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of AU$10.5, the company appears quite undervalued at a 47% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.
Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Treasury Wine Estates as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For Treasury Wine Estates, we've compiled three relevant items you should assess:

Treasury Wine says it is ready to ship Australian bottles to China

By Poonam Behura and Peter Hobson
(Reuters) -Shares of Treasury Wine Estates shot to a three-month high on Thursday after the company, one of the world's biggest wine makers, said core profit met expectations and it was ready to resume shipping Australian wine into China.
China accounted for one-third of Treasury's profit before Beijing imposed tariffs on Australian wine in 2020, effectively ending shipments.
However, relations between Canberra and Beijing have improved and the Australian government and wine industry expect the tariffs to lift in the coming weeks.
"We expect a decision and therefore a path forward by the end of March," Treasury CEO Tim Ford said on a conference call with analysts.
"We are both well prepared and well placed to reestablish our Australian country of origin portfolio in China," he said, adding that China was a "significant growth opportunity" for Treasury's higher-priced Penfolds division.
Melbourne-based Treasury, whose brands range from Wolf Blass and Lindeman's to Beringer and DAOU, has continued to ship wine made outside Australia to China and said it has more than 120 staff there.
Treasury produces wine mainly in Australia but also in the United States, New Zealand, France and Italy.
If Beijing did lift tariffs, Ford said Treasury would reallocate some of its Penfolds Bin and Icon wines from other global markets to China and raise prices globally on some of its more expensive Penfolds bottles.
The company's earnings before interest and taxes (EBITS) for first-half period ended Dec. 31 were A$289.8 million ($188.25 million), in line with Visible Alpha's consensus estimate.
Weakness in U.S. sales led to a 13% fall in profit to A$166.7 million but beat Jefferies's estimate of A$123 million.
"Some feared (the results) could have been worse than what was reported at a headline EBITS level," Citi analysts said in a note.
Treasury now expects stronger results in the second half and reiterated forecast for mid- to high-single-digit organic EBITS growth in 2024.
The company declared an interim dividend of 17 Australian cents per share, in line with consensus view, but below the 18 Australian cents it paid last year.
Treasury's shares were up nearly 3% at 0330 GMT having earlier been up more than 5% to reach their highest levels since Nov. 8. ($1 = 1.5394 Australian dollars)

It Might Not Be A Great Idea To Buy Treasury Wine Estates Limited (ASX:TWE) For Its Next Dividend

Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see 
 (
) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Thus, you can purchase Treasury Wine Estates' shares before the 6th of March in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 3rd of April.
The company's next dividend payment will be AU$0.17 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of AU$0.34 per share. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Treasury Wine Estates has a trailing yield of approximately 2.8% on its current stock price of AU$12.35. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing.
If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Last year, Treasury Wine Estates paid out 107% of its income as dividends, which is above a level that we're comfortable with, especially if the company needs to reinvest in its business. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. It paid out an unsustainably high 204% of its free cash flow as dividends over the past 12 months, which is worrying. Unless there were something in the business we're not grasping, this could signal a risk that the dividend may have to be cut in the future.
Cash is slightly more important than profit from a dividend perspective, but given Treasury Wine Estates's payouts were not well covered by either earnings or cash flow, we would be concerned about the sustainability of this dividend.
Click 
Companies with falling earnings are riskier for dividend shareholders. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. Treasury Wine Estates's earnings per share have fallen at approximately 10% a year over the previous five years. Such a sharp decline casts doubt on the future sustainability of the dividend.
Treasury Wine Estates also issued more than 5% of its market cap in new stock during the past year, which we feel is likely to hurt its dividend prospects in the long run. It's hard to grow dividends per share when a company keeps creating new shares.
The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, Treasury Wine Estates has increased its dividend at approximately 10% a year on average. The only way to pay higher dividends when earnings are shrinking is either to pay out a larger percentage of profits, spend cash from the balance sheet, or borrow the money. Treasury Wine Estates is already paying out 107% of its profits, and with shrinking earnings we think it's unlikely that this dividend will grow quickly in the future.
Has Treasury Wine Estates got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Not only are earnings per share declining, but Treasury Wine Estates is paying out an uncomfortably high percentage of both its earnings and cashflow to shareholders as dividends. This is a clearly suboptimal combination that usually suggests the dividend is at risk of being cut. If not now, then perhaps in the future. With the way things are shaping up from a dividend perspective, we'd be inclined to steer clear of Treasury Wine Estates.
So if you're still interested in Treasury Wine Estates despite it's poor dividend qualities, you should be well informed on some of the risks facing this stock. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 
 (of which 1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) you should know about.

Does Treasury Wine Estates Limited's (ASX:TWE) Weak Fundamentals Mean That The Market Could Correct Its Share Price?

Most readers would already be aware that Treasury Wine Estates' (ASX:TWE) stock increased significantly by 13% over the past three months. We, however wanted to have a closer look at its key financial indicators as the markets usually pay for long-term fundamentals, and in this case, they don't look very promising. In this article, we decided to focus on 
 ROE.
Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Treasury Wine Estates is:
4.9% = AU$233m ÷ AU$4.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).
The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each A$1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made A$0.05 in profit.
Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or "retains", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
At first glance, Treasury Wine Estates' ROE doesn't look very promising. Next, when compared to the average industry ROE of 12%, the company's ROE leaves us feeling even less enthusiastic. For this reason, Treasury Wine Estates' five year net income decline of 8.9% is not surprising given its lower ROE. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. Such as - low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.
However, when we compared Treasury Wine Estates' growth with the industry we found that while the company's earnings have been shrinking, the industry has seen an earnings growth of 10% in the same period. This is quite worrisome.
The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for TWE? You can find out in
With a high three-year median payout ratio of 84% (implying that 16% of the profits are retained), most of Treasury Wine Estates' profits are being paid to shareholders, which explains the company's shrinking earnings. With only a little being reinvested into the business, earnings growth would obviously be low or non-existent. You can see the 4 risks we have identified for Treasury Wine Estates by visiting our 
 for free 
Additionally, Treasury Wine Estates has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 68% of its profits over the next three years. However, Treasury Wine Estates' ROE is predicted to rise to 12% despite there being no anticipated change in its payout ratio.
In total, we would have a hard think before deciding on any investment action concerning Treasury Wine Estates. Because the company is not reinvesting much into the business, and given the low ROE, it's not surprising to see the lack or absence of growth in its earnings. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future.

Treasury Wine to resume distribution in China after import tariffs end

(Reuters) - Treasury Wine Estates will resume the distribution of some of its products in China, it said on Thursday, after the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said it would remove tariffs on Australian wine imports from March 29.
Treasury Wine will use partnerships with customers in China to distribute its Penfolds entry-level Australian origin portfolio as well as its Premium Brands Australian-sourced priority portfolio, it said.
In addition to resuming distribution, it plans to expand sales and increase its marketing resources and brand investment in China. It said, however, the incremental earnings from the Chinese sales of its wines would be minimal through the remainder of fiscal 2024.
Sales diminished after tariffs of up to 218.4% were first imposed in March 2021 for a period of five years along with other trade barriers on Australian commodities when ties soured after Canberra called for an investigation into the origins of COVID-19.
Ties between Canberra and Beijing have improved significantly since last year, leading to China steadily lifting trade barriers on Australian goods including barley and coal.

The five-year shareholder returns and company earnings persist lower as Treasury Wine Estates (ASX:TWE) stock falls a further 5.1% in past week

In order to justify the effort of selecting individual stocks, it's worth striving to beat the returns from a market index fund. But the main game is to find enough winners to more than offset the losers So we wouldn't blame long term 
 (
) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 24% over a half decade. Unfortunately the share price momentum is still quite negative, with prices down 11% in thirty days.
After losing 5.1% this past week, it's worth investigating the company's fundamentals to see what we can infer from past performance.
While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).
Looking back five years, both Treasury Wine Estates' share price and EPS declined; the latter at a rate of 12% per year. The share price decline of 5% per year isn't as bad as the EPS decline. So investors might expect EPS to bounce back -- or they may have previously foreseen the EPS decline.
The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).
It's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Treasury Wine Estates' 
.
As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Treasury Wine Estates' TSR for the last 5 years was -13%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the 
 shareholder return.
While the broader market gained around 13% in the last year, Treasury Wine Estates shareholders lost 11% (even including dividends). Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 2% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Exploring Three ASX Stocks Estimated To Be Up To 41.4% Below Intrinsic Value

The Australian stock market has seen a recent dip, dropping 2.0% over the last week, yet it maintains a positive trajectory with a 6.1% increase over the past year and earnings expected to grow by 14% annually. In such a fluctuating environment, identifying stocks that are trading below their intrinsic value could present opportunities for investors looking for potential growth at reduced prices.

 Flight Centre Travel Group Limited operates as a travel retailer serving both leisure and corporate sectors across Australia, New Zealand, the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and internationally with a market capitalization of A$4.39 billion.
 The company generates revenue primarily through its leisure and corporate travel services, amounting to A$1.28 billion and A$1.06 billion respectively.
 19.7%
Flight Centre Travel Group is positioned intriguingly in the Australian market with its earnings expected to grow at 18.8% annually, outpacing the broader market's 13.7%. While its revenue growth forecast of 9.7% per year also exceeds the Australian market average of 5.4%, it doesn’t reach the high growth benchmark of over 20%. Additionally, a projected return on equity of 21.7% in three years suggests strong potential for efficient capital management.
 Lovisa Holdings Limited is a retailer specializing in fashion jewelry and accessories, with a market capitalization of approximately A$3.43 billion.
 The company generates its revenue primarily from the retail sale of fashion jewelry and accessories, totaling approximately A$654 million.
 32.6%
Lovisa Holdings, trading at A$32.15, is valued below its estimated fair value of A$47.67, indicating a significant undervaluation based on cash flows. Forecasted to grow earnings by 19.23% annually, Lovisa's projected growth outstrips the Australian market's 13.7%. Additionally, its revenue growth rate of 14.3% annually surpasses the market average of 5.4%. Despite these positives, its earnings growth does not meet the high-growth threshold of over 20% per year.
 Treasury Wine Estates Limited is a global wine company with operations across Australia, New Zealand, Asia, Europe, the UK, the Middle East, Africa, and the Americas, boasting a market capitalization of approximately A$9.73 billion.

 41.4%
Treasury Wine Estates (TWE) is projected to outpace the Australian market with its revenue expected to increase by 10.1% annually, compared to the market's 5.4%. Earnings are also set to rise significantly at a rate of 22.5% per year over the next three years. However, challenges include a dividend coverage issue, as current payouts are not well supported by earnings or cash flows. Additionally, TWE has experienced shareholder dilution and declining profit margins year-over-year, alongside significant one-off items affecting financial results. Recently, TWE expanded its distribution in China through an exclusive agreement with Season Global Trading for its Penfolds Champagne series, potentially boosting future revenues.

Painful week for individual investors invested in Treasury Wine Estates Limited (ASX:TWE) after 7.3% drop, institutions also suffered losses

A look at the shareholders of Treasury Wine Estates Limited (
) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that individual investors own the lion's share in the company with 60% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.
Following a 7.3% decrease in the stock price last week, individual investors suffered the most losses, but institutions who own 40% stock also took a hit.
Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Treasury Wine Estates.
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
Treasury Wine Estates already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Treasury Wine Estates' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
Treasury Wine Estates is not owned by hedge funds. Capital Research and Management Company is currently the largest shareholder, with 7.5% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 6.1% and 5.6%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.
A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.
Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.
The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.
Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.
Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Treasury Wine Estates Limited in their own names. It is a pretty big company, so it would be possible for board members to own a meaningful interest in the company, without owning much of a proportional interest. In this case, they own around AU$15m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking 
The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a substantial 60% stake in Treasury Wine Estates, suggesting it is a fairly popular stock. This size of ownership gives investors from the general public some collective power. They can and probably do influence decisions on executive compensation, dividend policies and proposed business acquisitions.
It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Treasury Wine Estates better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified 
 that you should be aware of.
If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check

Treasury Wine Estates moves revenue-growth team into premium-brands division

Australia's Treasury Wine Estates (TWE) has merged a new team focussed on revenue growth into its premium-brands division as it looks to “unlock” growth for focus brands.
The Melbourne-headquartered group said the move would help “strengthen innovation” and deepen its engagement with customer partners and end consumers.
Its ‘global revenue growth’ team (GRG) established by the group’s global chief revenue growth officer Angus Liley in 2023. It was tasked with “driving” revenue opportunities by setting out growth plans for current and future global brands, as well as working on innovation and consumer intelligence.
Liley will now take over the TPB division as managing director from Peter Neilson. After 12 years at TWE, Neilson is leaving TWE to “pursue new career opportunities”.
The corporate structural and leadership changes at TWE will come into effect 1 July.
“When you consider our premium portfolio, this is a unique offering with an unrivalled global footprint and brands that resonate strongly with consumers,” TWE CEO Tim Ford said.
“Integrating our GRG capabilities within TPB, will enhance our ability to strengthen these brands, foster cutting-edge innovation and deepen our engagement with consumers and customer partners.”
TWE has been reshaping its portfolio over the last year, as the company puts more emphasis on its “premium” and “luxury” ranges.
Last year, Treasury Wine Estates announced 
 its “commercial” wine operation in Victoria amid pressure on sales of more mainstream wine in the country. At the time, the company said the decision to close its Karadoc winery had been made in light of rising costs and a decline in consumption of wine sold at below A$10 (then $6.70) a bottle.
The group has also made several plays for higher-priced wine brands.
In October, TWE acquired California’s 
 for $900m. The deal, which could rise to $1bn, will see the company take 100% of Daou Vineyards, including three wineries and 389 acres of vineyards across Paso Robles, and a winery and 22 acres of vines in San Luis Obispo.
A month later, 
 to expand its footprint in New Zealand with its purchase of a vineyard in Marlborough.
For the opening six months of its fiscal 2024, TWE reported sales of A$1.313bn compared to A$1.308bn a year ago. Net income was A$166.7m, down 11.4%.
The group’s earnings before interest, tax, SGARA and material items (EBITS) dropped 5.8% to A$289.8m, driven by Treasury Americas and Treasury Premium Brands, which featured a 17.5% and 3.2% decline in EBITS respectively.
Treasury Wine Estates slightly lowered its full-year guidance for its fiscal 2024, now estimating mid-to-high single-digit growth from a previous estimate of high single-digit growth.

Treasury Wine Estates automates barrel storage

Australia’s Treasury Wine Estates (TWE) has automated its barrel handling system at its winery in Barossa valley.
TWE's A$10m ($6.7m) investment included the installation and creation of a barrel management system, as well as automated washing and filling stations.
The “end-to-end” automated system includes nine driverless forklifts that rotate the barrels according to maturation stages. The group said the process runs for 24 hours, five days a week.
“We’ve seen improvements in safety, efficiency, and traceability in our barrel hall, with the team on site embracing the new way of working. The efficiency and precision of automated, sensor-based forklifts to transport the barrels lowers energy consumption compared to manual handling processes,” TWE director of supply technology Jodie Rowlands said.
The vintner said the automation will allow the winery to boost its red wine “handling capacity” to 125,000 barrels at the site. It handles 60,000 barrels of wine.
TWE opened its Barossa Valley facility in 2022, following a A$164m investment project.

Operating profits were up 81% to £2.3m, while adjusted EBITDA increased 87% at £5.4m, helped by “profitable trading” and an adjustment to grape prices following a record 2023 harvest. The winemaker said the year had been “profitable at all levels”.
Chapel Down harvested 3,811 tonnes of grapes, its highest amount to date. These made up for around 3.4 million bottles. More than two million of these were to be used in its sparkling wines. This figure was an 86% increase on 2022 (2,050 tonnes) and 75% higher than the company’s 2018 record (2,173 tonnes).
