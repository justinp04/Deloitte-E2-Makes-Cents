With EPS Growth And More, Whitehaven Coal (ASX:WHC) Makes An Interesting Case

For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.
Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like 
 (
). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.
In the last three years Whitehaven Coal's earnings per share took off; so much so that it's a bit disingenuous to use these figures to try and deduce long term estimates. Thus, it makes sense to focus on more recent growth rates, instead. Whitehaven Coal's EPS skyrocketed from AU$1.98 to AU$3.19, in just one year; a result that's bound to bring a smile to shareholders. That's a commendable gain of 61%.
Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Whitehaven Coal shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 57% to 62%, and revenue is growing. That's great to see, on both counts.
In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.
Of course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to 
.
It should give investors a sense of security owning shares in a company if insiders also own shares, creating a close alignment their interests. Shareholders will be pleased by the fact that insiders own Whitehaven Coal shares worth a considerable sum. With a whopping AU$99m worth of shares as a group, insiders have plenty riding on the company's success. This should keep them focused on creating long term value for shareholders.
For growth investors, Whitehaven Coal's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in Whitehaven Coal's continuing strength. The growth and insider confidence is looked upon well and so it's worthwhile to investigate further with a view to discern the stock's true value. What about risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted 
 (of which 1 can't be ignored!) you should know about.
The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want. But if you prefer to focus on stocks that have demonstrated insider buying, here is

INSIGHT-Coal miners forced to save for a rainy day by insurance snub

By Clara Denina and Sarah McFarlane
LONDON, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Some coal producers are having to set aside tens of millions of dollars to cover their own risks as they are cut adrift by insurers, making it more difficult and costly to do business amid a surge in demand for the fossil fuel.
Dozens of insurers have announced restrictions on their cover for the coal industry, particularly for new projects, in response to pressure from shareholders, governments and environmental groups who want to limit coal's contribution to global warming. This follows similar moves by banks to restrict their coal financing activities.
Coal miners need extensive insurance including for operations, property, equipment, and environmental liability. Three insurance brokers said it can now take months and dozens of enquiries to find such coverage for a coal client.
Reuters spoke to five coal mining executives who said that the industry is increasingly moving towards self-insurance and self-finance, as the difficulty of securing coverage from insurers makes loans more expensive or unavailable.
Some miners, including South Africa's Seriti Resources and Thungela Resources, are already setting aside capital to self-insure and only buying insurance to protect against larger and less frequent losses.
While Seriti has said it is not struggling to get funding from banks, securing insurance cover has become more challenging, according to its chief financial officer Doug Gain.
"In recognition of ESG and related factors shrinking the availability of thermal coal insurance capacity globally, Seriti has embarked on a journey toward increased self-insurance," Gain told Reuters via email.
He did not elaborate on the cost for Seriti, which supplies many of South Africa's coal power stations.
Many coal producers are finding workarounds and production continues to rise. The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts 2023 global supplies will surpass last year's record of 8.6 billion tons, after the energy crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine forced many countries to use coal to keep the lights on.
But the need to earmark funds for self-insurance ties up money on the balance sheets of coal companies and could leave them vulnerable to large costs when something goes wrong, industry analysts say.
Three analysts told Reuters that coal companies have been able to absorb any increase in costs due to record profits last year, but may find it harder in leaner times, as the issues with insurance ultimately push up the cost of production.
"Financing becomes impossible without insurance," said Liberum equity analyst Ben Davis.
"For existing producers at the moment, this is not a massive issue because they can still set funds aside, given sustained coal prices. But there are going to be tougher times ahead for the ones that don't set the money aside," he added.
The dwindling supply of insurance for coal producers has led to premiums rising nearly three times as much as an industry benchmark, data from brokerage Willis Towers Watson shows.
Thermal coal insurance rates rose more than 20% last year, it said, above the 7.3% rise in the benchmark Marsh Global Insurance Market Index.
Whitehaven Coal, Australia's top independent coal miner, has seen its insurance costs roughly double over the last two years, a person familiar with the company who asked not to be identified because the information is financially sensitive, told Reuters.
Whitehaven declined to comment.
TAKE COVER
Seriti has a combination of self-insurance to cover damage to some assets, while retaining some cover from the insurance industry such as flood damage or underground fire damage, a spokesperson said.
To reduce the cost of insurance cover, Seriti is increasing the retention of capital in its own insurance unit so that only excess layers of risk need to be insured by third parties.
"We expect the availability of insurance capacity for thermal coal assets to continue to shrink over time and the capacity will likely be extremely limited by circa 2030," Gain said.
In the case of Thungela - a company spun off from Anglo American - it set aside R1.2 billion ($67 million) to self-insure some of its risk last year, while still sourcing its catastrophic risk cover, including events like mine collapses or natural disasters, from the insurance market.
Thungela told Reuters it intends to become fully self-insured in future, without specifying the timeframe.
Forty-five insurance companies have introduced restrictions now on cover for the coal industry, including Allianz, Swiss Re and Munich Re, according to the Insure Our Future environmental pressure group.
Some insurers still have relatively large fossil fuel businesses, with Bermuda's AEGIS, China's PICC, Russia's SOGAZ, Switzerland's Chubb and Germany's Allianz the top five by gross premiums in 2022, according to data exclusively provided to Reuters by Insuramore, which produces insurance rankings and analysis.
AEGIS said in an email that its coal business represents a small portion of its total and was decreasing, while Allianz said it will phase out coal-based business by 2040.
Chubb, which says it does not insure new risks for miners generating more than 30% of their revenue from coal, declined to comment. China's PICC and Russia's SOGAZ did not respond to a request for comment.
Some coal producers have set up their own separate company to deal with their insurance - called a captive - which can be covered by a combination of their own funds, individual insurance companies, and a group of insurance companies working together to share the risk with so-called reinsurance.
Insurance companies can be active in both primary insurance and reinsurance and have differing commitments on ESG for different parts of their business.
"The majority of the reinsurance market remains open to the ongoing operations of coal companies but not their new projects," said Insure Our Future coordinator Peter Bosshard.
MUTUAL INSURANCE FUND
In Australia, coal companies have explored setting up a mutual insurance fund that they would all pay into as a form of self-insurance, but talks have stalled with a lack of government support, people familiar with the matter said.
"Establishing a mutual fund for the coal industry is a matter for the coal industry," a spokesperson for the Australian Department of Treasury said. "Any financial support or guarantee for a mutual fund would involve a decision of government."
The spokesperson did not say whether the government had been approached by companies about the fund.
Nombasa Tsengwa, Chief Executive Officer at South African coal miner Exxaro Resources, said that insurers in some countries and regions, including in Asia, were more willing to do business than elsewhere.
"What we have also noticed is that there are other jurisdictions that are interested in absorbing the risk of coal businesses," Tsengwa said, referring to more stringent regulations in Europe.
"I'm talking about going beyond your normal UK-based markets and looking into Asia for funders and insurance cover," she added.
Coal prices hit record highs in September last year as European countries scrambled to replace Russian gas, sending coal miners' profits soaring.
But prices have since fallen and analysts say the need by producers to meet more of their own financing and insurance requirements could exacerbate the impact of weaker prices on profits.
Thungela and Exxaro saw their profits fall by 75% and 29% respectively in the first half on weaker prices. Major diversified miner Glencore said its industrial assets' profit fell by 51% in the first half due to lower prices, particularly in coal, and inflationary costs.

BHP iron ore production falls 4% in September qtr, guidance steady

Investing.com-- Anglo-Australian miner BHP Group Ltd (ASX:BHP) logged a small decline in iron ore production during the September quarter due to maintenance activity in its rail networks and some mining areas.
The miner also said that Whitehaven Coal Ltd (ASX:WHC) had been selected as the preferred bidder for the sale of its Daunia and Blackwater coal mines, which it owns together with Japan’s Mitsubishi Development. BHP did not specify a deal value, while separately, Whitehaven entered a trading halt pending details on the sale.
West Australian iron ore production, on a 100% basis, fell 4% from the prior quarter to 69.4 million tonnes (mt). BHP said that while production was weaker due to planned maintenance activity, this was somewhat offset by favorable weather conditions.
BHP maintained its production guidance for fiscal 2024 at a range of 282 mt to 294 mt.
While the miner has steadily ramped up production, logging record-high iron ore output in fiscal 2023, it is grappling with somewhat sluggish demand in China, its biggest market.
The miner logged its weakest annual profit in three years for fiscal 2023, even as it logged record-high iron ore production for the year.
The steel-making material is a key resource for China’s property sector, which has been struggling with a nearly three year-long cash crunch. This trend has also weighed on iron ore prices, denting BHP’s margins.
Peer Rio Tinto Ltd (ASX:RIO), which is the world’s largest iron ore producer, clocked stronger shipments in the third quarter on some recovery in Chinese demand.
BHP’s total copper production fell 4% from the prior quarter to 457,000 tonnes, while its annual production guidance was unchanged at 1.7 mt to 1.9 mt.
Metallurgical coal production sank 34%, while energy coal production fell 24% in the three months to September. Annual coal production guidance was also left unchanged.
BHP has been steadily attempting to pivot away from coal production, citing environmental concerns. Its sale to Whitehaven comes as another step towards the pivot, after the firm sold out of the South Walker Creek and Poitrel coal mines in 2022.

Whitehaven Coal Limited (ASX:WHC) surges 3.0%; retail investors who own 51% shares profited along with institutions

A look at the shareholders of Whitehaven Coal Limited (
) can tell us which group is most powerful. With 51% stake, retail investors possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
Retail investors gained the most after market cap touched AU$6.0b last week, while institutions who own 43% also benefitted.
Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Whitehaven Coal, beginning with the chart below.
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
Whitehaven Coal already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Whitehaven Coal's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.
Hedge funds don't have many shares in Whitehaven Coal. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is UBS Asset Management AG with 6.0% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 5.7% and 5.2% of the stock.
On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
We can report that insiders do own shares in Whitehaven Coal Limited. It is a pretty big company, so it is generally a positive to see some potentially meaningful alignment. In this case, they own around AU$129m worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking 
The general public -- including retail investors -- own 51% of Whitehaven Coal. This level of ownership gives investors from the wider public some power to sway key policy decisions such as board composition, executive compensation, and the dividend payout ratio.
It seems that Private Companies own 3.2%, of the Whitehaven Coal stock. Private companies may be related parties. Sometimes insiders have an interest in a public company through a holding in a private company, rather than in their own capacity as an individual. While it's hard to draw any broad stroke conclusions, it is worth noting as an area for further research.
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks for example - Whitehaven Coal has

Whitehaven Coal Limited's (ASX:WHC) CEO Will Probably Have Their Compensation Approved By Shareholders

It would be hard to discount the role that CEO Paul Flynn has played in delivering the impressive results at 
 (
) recently. The pleasing results would be something shareholders would keep in mind at the upcoming AGM on 25th of October. This would also be a chance for them to hear the board review the financial results, discuss future company strategy and vote on any resolutions such as executive remuneration. In light of the great performance, we discuss the case why we think CEO compensation is not excessive.
Our data indicates that Whitehaven Coal Limited has a market capitalization of AU$6.3b, and total annual CEO compensation was reported as AU$5.9m for the year to June 2023. That's mostly flat as compared to the prior year's compensation. While this analysis focuses on total compensation, it's worth acknowledging that the salary portion is lower, valued at AU$1.9m.
For comparison, other companies in the 
 with market capitalizations ranging between AU$3.1b and AU$10b had a median total CEO compensation of AU$4.9m. From this we gather that Paul Flynn is paid around the median for CEOs in the industry. What's more, Paul Flynn holds AU$8.1m worth of shares in the company in their own name, indicating that they have a lot of skin in the game.
Talking in terms of the industry, salary represented approximately 62% of total compensation out of all the companies we analyzed, while other remuneration made up 38% of the pie. Whitehaven Coal sets aside a smaller share of compensation for salary, in comparison to the overall industry. If non-salary compensation dominates total pay, it's an indicator that the executive's salary is tied to company performance.
Whitehaven Coal Limited's earnings per share (EPS) grew 372% per year over the last three years. Its revenue is up 23% over the last year.
Shareholders would be glad to know that the company has improved itself over the last few years. It's a real positive to see this sort of revenue growth in a single year. That suggests a healthy and growing business. Looking ahead, you might want to check 
.
Boasting a total shareholder return of 740% over three years, Whitehaven Coal Limited has done well by shareholders. So they may not be at all concerned if the CEO were to be paid more than is normal for companies around the same size.
Given the company's decent performance, the CEO remuneration policy might not be shareholders' central point of focus in the AGM. In fact, strategic decisions that could impact the future of the business might be a far more interesting topic for investors as it would help them set their longer-term expectations.
CEO pay is simply one of the many factors that need to be considered while examining business performance. That's why we did our research, and identified 
 (of which 1 is a bit concerning!) that you should know about in order to have a holistic understanding of the stock.

Investing in Whitehaven Coal (ASX:WHC) three years ago would have delivered you a 511% gain

Generally speaking, investors are inspired to be stock pickers by the potential to find the big winners. Mistakes are inevitable, but a single top stock pick can cover any losses, and so much more. One bright shining star stock has been 
 (
), which is 408% higher than three years ago.
Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.
To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.
During three years of share price growth, Whitehaven Coal achieved compound earnings per share growth of 372% per year. The average annual share price increase of 72% is actually lower than the EPS growth. So it seems investors have become more cautious about the company, over time. This cautious sentiment is reflected in its (fairly low) P/E ratio of 2.14.
The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).
It's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. This 
 interactive report on Whitehaven Coal's 
 is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.
When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between 
 (TSR) and 
. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Whitehaven Coal the TSR over the last 3 years was 511%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the 
 shareholder return.
Investors in Whitehaven Coal had a tough year, with a total loss of 13% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 3.9%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 17%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Even so, be aware that

Bullish Whitehaven Coal Insiders Loaded Up On AU$1.36m Of Stock

Quite a few insiders have dramatically grown their holdings in 
 (
) over the past 12 months. An insider's optimism about the company's prospects is a positive sign.
While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.
The Non-Executive Director George Raymond Zage made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for AU$1.0m worth of shares at a price of AU$7.59 each. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of AU$7.24. Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares. It is generally more encouraging if they paid above the current price, as it suggests they saw value, even at higher levels.
Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 180.50k shares worth AU$1.4m. But insiders sold 20.00k shares worth AU$212k. Overall, Whitehaven Coal insiders were net buyers during the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!
Whitehaven Coal is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find 
 this 
 
Over the last three months, we've seen significant insider buying at Whitehaven Coal. In total, insiders bought AU$250k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any sales whatsoever. This is a positive in our book as it implies some confidence.
Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Whitehaven Coal insiders own about AU$130m worth of shares. That equates to 2.1% of the company. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.
It is good to see recent purchasing. We also take confidence from the longer term picture of insider transactions. Once you factor in the high insider ownership, it certainly seems like insiders are positive about Whitehaven Coal. One for the watchlist, at least! So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. For instance, we've identified

Whitehaven Coal Limited's (ASX:WHC) Recent Stock Performance Looks Decent- Can Strong Fundamentals Be the Reason?

Whitehaven Coal's (ASX:WHC) stock is up by 2.1% over the past week. Given its impressive performance, we decided to study the company's key financial indicators as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on Whitehaven Coal's ROE.
Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Whitehaven Coal is:
51% = AU$2.7b ÷ AU$5.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).
The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every A$1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of A$0.51.
We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or "retain", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.
Firstly, we acknowledge that Whitehaven Coal has a significantly high ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 18% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. As a result, Whitehaven Coal's exceptional 49% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise.
We then compared Whitehaven Coal's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 33% in the same 5-year period.
Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is Whitehaven Coal fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.
Whitehaven Coal has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 21%, meaning that it has the remaining 79% left over to reinvest into its business. So it looks like Whitehaven Coal is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth.
Moreover, Whitehaven Coal is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of six years of paying a dividend. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 36% over the next three years. Consequently, the higher expected payout ratio explains the decline in the company's expected ROE (to 8.3%) over the same period.
On the whole, we feel that Whitehaven Coal's performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink.

If EPS Growth Is Important To You, Whitehaven Coal (ASX:WHC) Presents An Opportunity

The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.
Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like 
 (
). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it.
Over the last three years, Whitehaven Coal has grown earnings per share (EPS) at as impressive rate from a relatively low point, resulting in a three year percentage growth rate that isn't particularly indicative of expected future performance. So it would be better to isolate the growth rate over the last year for our analysis. Whitehaven Coal's EPS skyrocketed from AU$1.98 to AU$3.19, in just one year; a result that's bound to bring a smile to shareholders. That's a impressive gain of 61%.
Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Whitehaven Coal shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 57% to 61%, and revenue is growing. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.

Insider interest in a company always sparks a bit of intrigue and many investors are on the lookout for companies where insiders are putting their money where their mouth is. That's because insider buying often indicates that those closest to the company have confidence that the share price will perform well. Of course, we can never be sure what insiders are thinking, we can only judge their actions.
It's pleasing to note that insiders spent AU$1.4m buying Whitehaven Coal shares, over the last year, without reporting any share sales whatsoever. Buying like that is a fantastic look for the company and should rouse the market in anticipation for the future. Zooming in, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Non-Executive Director George Raymond Zage for AU$1.0m worth of shares, at about AU$7.59 per share.
The good news, alongside the insider buying, for Whitehaven Coal bulls is that insiders (collectively) have a meaningful investment in the stock. Holding AU$151m worth of stock in the company is no laughing matter and insiders will be committed in delivering the best outcomes for shareholders. This should keep them focused on creating long term value for shareholders.
For growth investors, Whitehaven Coal's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. Not only that, but we can see that insiders both own a lot of, and are buying more shares in the company. Astute investors will want to keep this stock on watch. It is worth noting though that we have found 
 (1 can't be ignored!) that you need to take into consideration.
The good news is that Whitehaven Coal is not the only growth stock with insider buying. Here's

Estimating The Intrinsic Value Of Whitehaven Coal Limited (ASX:WHC)

In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Whitehaven Coal Limited (
) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.
We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the 
.
We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:
 = AU$2.9b
After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.7%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$491m× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.7%– 2.0%) = AU$8.7b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$8.7b÷ ( 1 + 7.7%)
= AU$4.1b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is AU$7.0b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of AU$7.3, the company appears about fair value at a 13% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.
We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Whitehaven Coal as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.148. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For Whitehaven Coal, there are three relevant aspects you should explore:

Painful week for retail investors invested in Whitehaven Coal Limited (ASX:WHC) after 9.0% drop, institutions also suffered losses

A look at the shareholders of Whitehaven Coal Limited (ASX:WHC) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that retail investors own the lion's share in the company with 52% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
While the holdings of retail investors took a hit after last week’s 9.0% price drop, institutions with their 42% holdings also suffered.
Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Whitehaven Coal.
Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.
We can see that Whitehaven Coal does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Whitehaven Coal, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.
Whitehaven Coal is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Dimensional Fund Advisors LP with 5.7% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 5.0% of common stock, and JPMorgan Chase & Co, Brokerage and Securities Investments holds about 4.4% of the company stock.
Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.
While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.
Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Whitehaven Coal Limited. This is a big company, so it is good to see this level of alignment. Insiders own AU$115m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see this level of investment by insiders. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently.
The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a substantial 52% stake in Whitehaven Coal, suggesting it is a fairly popular stock. With this amount of ownership, retail investors can collectively play a role in decisions that affect shareholder returns, such as dividend policies and the appointment of directors. They can also exercise the power to vote on acquisitions or mergers that may not improve profitability.
It seems that Private Companies own 3.2%, of the Whitehaven Coal stock. Private companies may be related parties. Sometimes insiders have an interest in a public company through a holding in a private company, rather than in their own capacity as an individual. While it's hard to draw any broad stroke conclusions, it is worth noting as an area for further research.
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified 
 (2 can't be ignored) that you should be aware of.
But ultimately 
, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.

Whitehaven Coal Limited Earnings Missed Analyst Estimates: Here's What Analysts Are Forecasting Now

Shareholders might have noticed that 
 (
) filed its half-year result this time last week. The early response was not positive, with shares down 4.7% to AU$7.13 in the past week. It looks like a pretty bad result, all things considered. Although revenues of AU$1.6b were in line with analyst predictions, statutory earnings fell badly short, missing estimates by 37% to hit AU$0.32 per share. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year.
Taking into account the latest results, the current consensus from Whitehaven Coal's ten analysts is for revenues of AU$4.17b in 2024. This would reflect a solid 8.4% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are forecast to plunge 31% to AU$0.95 in the same period. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of AU$4.26b and earnings per share (EPS) of AU$1.04 in 2024. It's pretty clear that pessimism has reared its head after the latest results, leading to a weaker revenue outlook and a small dip in earnings per share estimates.
The analysts made no major changes to their price target of AU$8.22, suggesting the downgrades are not expected to have a long-term impact on Whitehaven Coal's valuation. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. There are some variant perceptions on Whitehaven Coal, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at AU$11.40 and the most bearish at AU$6.00 per share. This is a fairly broad spread of estimates, suggesting that analysts are forecasting a wide range of possible outcomes for the business.
Looking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and 
 growth estimates. We would highlight that Whitehaven Coal's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 18% annualised growth rate until the end of 2024 being well below the historical 27% p.a. growth over the last five years. Juxtapose this against the other companies in the industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenues (in aggregate) 0.2% per year. So it's pretty clear that, while Whitehaven Coal's revenue growth is expected to slow, it's still expected to grow faster than the industry itself.
The most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results. Regrettably, they also downgraded their revenue estimates, but the latest forecasts still imply the business will grow faster than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at AU$8.22, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.
With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for Whitehaven Coal going out to 2026, and you can

An Intrinsic Calculation For Whitehaven Coal Limited (ASX:WHC) Suggests It's 34% Undervalued

In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Whitehaven Coal Limited (
) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!
Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the 
.
We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:
 = AU$2.9b
The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.4%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$668m× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.4%– 2.2%) = AU$13b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$13b÷ ( 1 + 7.4%)
= AU$6.5b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is AU$9.3b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of AU$7.4, the company appears quite undervalued at a 34% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.
The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Whitehaven Coal as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.130. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to "what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

Whitehaven Coal's (ASX:WHC) investors will be pleased with their enviable 692% return over the last three years

For us, stock picking is in large part the hunt for the truly magnificent stocks. You won't get it right every time, but when you do, the returns can be truly splendid. One bright shining star stock has been 
 (
), which is 552% higher than three years ago. And in the last month, the share price has gained 14%. We love happy stories like this one. The company should be really proud of that performance!
Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.
While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.
Whitehaven Coal became profitable within the last three years. Given the importance of this milestone, it's not overly surprising that the share price has increased strongly.
You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).
It's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Whitehaven Coal's 
.
As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Whitehaven Coal's TSR for the last 3 years was 692%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!
It's good to see that Whitehaven Coal has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 22% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 21%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Whitehaven Coal better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 
 (1 is a bit concerning!) that you should be aware of before investing here.
There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do

Whitehaven Coal Limited's (ASX:WHC) Stock Is Going Strong: Is the Market Following Fundamentals?

Whitehaven Coal (ASX:WHC) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 18% over the last three months. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. In this article, we decided to focus on 
 ROE.
Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Whitehaven Coal is:
22% = AU$1.1b ÷ AU$5.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).
The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every A$1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn A$0.22 in profit.
Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or "retain", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
At first glance, Whitehaven Coal seems to have a decent ROE. Especially when compared to the industry average of 15% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. This certainly adds some context to Whitehaven Coal's exceptional 48% net income growth seen over the past five years. However, there could also be other causes behind this growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.
Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Whitehaven Coal's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 33% in the same period, which is great to see.
Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. If you're wondering about Whitehaven Coal's's valuation, check out 
, as compared to its industry.
Whitehaven Coal has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 22%, meaning that it has the remaining 78% left over to reinvest into its business. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business as evidenced by the growth seen by the company.
Additionally, Whitehaven Coal has paid dividends over a period of seven years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 20%. However, Whitehaven Coal's future ROE is expected to decline to 14% despite there being not much change anticipated in the company's payout ratio.
Overall, we are quite pleased with Whitehaven Coal's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. That being so, according to the latest industry analyst forecasts, the company's earnings are expected to shrink in the future. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

India's JSW Steel in talks with Australia's Whitehaven for coal mine stake

By Neha Arora
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's JSW Steel Ltd is in talks with Australian miner Whitehaven Coal for a stake in its Blackwater metallurgical coal mine, a source aware of the discussions said on Tuesday. JSW Steel, India's largest steel producer by capacity, is conducting due diligence and expects to get a coking coal sample from the mine this month to check specifications, the source said. Whitehaven in January said it was exploring a potential sell-down of about 20% of Blackwater to global steel producers as strategic joint venture partners.
The miner acquired the Blackwater and Daunia mines from BHP Group in a $4.1 billion deal last October, and expects the acquisition to complete in early April.
JSW Steel could consider acquiring more than a 20% stake in Blackwater, the source said.
JSW has held initial talks with Blackwater but has yet to see the specifications of the coking coal from the metallurgical coal mine in Australia, the source said.
A spokeperson for Whitehaven declined to comment on any talks with JSW Steel but referenced mention of the joint venture sell-down in the company's earlier statements. A JSW Steel spokesperson declined comment. JSW Steel has been scouting for coking coal assets overseas.
The company currently imports coking coal from Canada, Australia, the United States, and some grades from Russia. Last year, JSW Steel was in talks with Canada's Teck Resources for a stake in its coking coal unit but eventually a Glencore-led consortium agreed to buy it for $9 billion.
Coking coal is emerging as a top option for companies to make a foray into, as it is used to make steel, an important component in large infrastructure and renewable projects.
India was planning to form a consortium of state-owned companies to facilitate coking coal imports to help domestic steel companies tide over shortages, Reuters reported last month.
Indian steel companies consume around 70 million metric tons of coking coal annually, and imports constitute around 85% of the country's total requirement.

India's JSW Steel CEO says mills in talks with govt on trade measures against imports

By Neha Arora
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Indian steel industry is in talks with the federal government for trade measures to combat rising imports particularly from China and Vietnam, JSW Steel Chief Executive Jayant Acharya told Reuters on Tuesday.
India turned net steel importer in the fiscal year that ended in March and the trend continues with its finished steel imports scaling a five-year high in April and May, according to provisional government data.
"Indian steel industry is in discussion with the government. I think there are measures which we would be requesting the government to take up," Acharya said, without elaborating on the possible measures being discussed.
India's steel and trade ministries have been in talks over rising imports, Reuters had reported last month.
EXPORTS, COKING COAL
This year, JSW Steel expects its exports to be 10-15% of total sales, Acharya said, adding that international markets were "muted" as of now, while demand in India was "extremely strong".
Separately, Acharya denied the company was in talks with Australian miner Whitehaven Coal for a stake in its Blackwater metallurgical coal mine.
Whitehaven in January said it was exploring a potential sell-down of about 20% of Blackwater to global steel producers as strategic joint venture partners.
However, JSW Steel continues to look for coking coal assets overseas, including Australia, and Canada, Acharya said.
Acharya also said the company was open to importing coking coal from Mongolia but as of now there was "nothing on the radar".
He also opposed a proposal from the trade remedies body against capping imports of low ash metallurgical coke, a steelmaking fuel.
"Putting any kind of duties on materials which we don't internally have, doesn't make strategic sense," Acharya said.
Last month, Reuters reported that India's steel ministry also did not favour limits on imports of met coke, citing risks to domestic output.

Australian Coal Stocks Rally on Anglo American Mine Explosion

(Bloomberg) -- Australian coal stocks are headed for their best week in years after a fire shut down one of country’s major mines, with Morgan Stanley seeing further upside for the commodity.
Most Read from Bloomberg
Whitehaven Coal Ltd. is poised for a 17% weekly advance, its best since October 2022, with Sydney-listed Coronado Global Resources Inc. and Yancoal Australia Ltd. posting similar gains. Coking coal futures in Singapore hit a two-month high earlier this week after a fire at Anglo American Plc’s biggest metallurgical coal project in Australia halted production.
The fire “may help bring about an earlier tightening of the market balance,” Morgan Stanley analysts including Sara Chan wrote in a July 3 note, adding they expect about 15% upside to year-end coking coal prices. “We see a near-term opportunity in coking or met coal, especially after the recent share price pullback.”
Read: Anglo Coking-Coal Mine Blaze to Have Months-Long Impact
The blaze at Anglo’s Grosvenor mine, which started after a methane explosion on Saturday, took roughly 1% of seaborne coal out of the market and could take months to extinguish. It also coincided with the London-based miner’s plans to sell the asset as part of a turnaround plan.
“This unfortunate event does help competitors as they can continue to produce met coal,” said Jamie Hannah, Sydney-based deputy head of investments and capital markets at Van Eck Associates Corp., which holds Whitehaven and Coronado shares. Whitehaven has expanded their operations in met coal, “so this will no doubt play to their short-term advantage,” he said.
Still, “until we understand the issues at the Anglo mine, it’s too difficult to predict the medium to long-term impact,” he added.
