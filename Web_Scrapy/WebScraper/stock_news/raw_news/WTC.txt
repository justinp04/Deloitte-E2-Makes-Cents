The total return for WiseTech Global (ASX:WTC) investors has risen faster than earnings growth over the last five years

 (
) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 18% in the last quarter. But that doesn't change the fact that shareholders have received really good returns over the last five years. We think most investors would be happy with the 237% return, over that period. Generally speaking the long term returns will give you a better idea of business quality than short periods can. Only time will tell if there is still too much optimism currently reflected in the share price.
Since the long term performance has been good but there's been a recent pullback of 6.2%, let's check if the fundamentals match the share price.
There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).
Over half a decade, WiseTech Global managed to grow its earnings per share at 36% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 27% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock. Having said that, the market is still optimistic, given the P/E ratio of 97.53.
The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).
We like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of WiseTech Global's

It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of WiseTech Global, it has a TSR of 240% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!
It's nice to see that WiseTech Global shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 14% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 28% a year, is even better. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. If you want to research this stock further, the data on insider buying is an obvious place to start. You can

WiseTech Global (ASX:WTC) Has Some Way To Go To Become A Multi-Bagger

If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. Firstly, we'll want to see a proven 
 on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding 
 of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So, when we ran our eye over 
 (
) trend of ROCE, we liked what we saw.
For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for WiseTech Global:
0.16 = AU$328m ÷ (AU$2.7b - AU$581m) 
.
So, 
 In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Software industry average of 11% it's much better.
In the above chart we have measured WiseTech Global's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering WiseTech Global 
 for 
While the current returns on capital are decent, they haven't changed much. The company has consistently earned 16% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 354% in that time. Since 16% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.
To sum it up, WiseTech Global has simply been reinvesting capital steadily, at those decent rates of return. And the stock has done incredibly well with a 337% return over the last five years, so long term investors are no doubt ecstatic with that result. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.
While WiseTech Global doesn't shine too bright in this respect, it's still worth seeing if the company is trading at attractive prices. You can find that out with our

It May Be Possible That WiseTech Global Limited's (ASX:WTC) CEO Compensation Could Get Bumped Up

Shareholders will be pleased by the robust performance of 
 (
) recently and this will be kept in mind in the upcoming AGM on 23rd of November. The focus will probably be on the future strategic initiatives that the board and management will put in place to improve the business rather than executive remuneration when they cast their votes on company resolutions. In our analysis below, we discuss why we think the CEO compensation looks acceptable and the case for a raise.
At the time of writing, our data shows that WiseTech Global Limited has a market capitalization of AU$22b, and reported total annual CEO compensation of AU$1.1m for the year to June 2023. This means that the compensation hasn't changed much from last year. Notably, the salary which is AU$974.7k, represents most of the total compensation being paid.
For comparison, other companies in the 
 with market capitalizations above AU$12b, reported a median total CEO compensation of AU$17m. That is to say, Richard White is paid under the industry median.
Speaking on an industry level, nearly 59% of total compensation represents salary, while the remainder of 41% is other remuneration. WiseTech Global pays out 89% of remuneration in the form of a salary, significantly higher than the industry average. If salary is the major component in total compensation, it suggests that the CEO receives a higher fixed proportion of the total compensation, regardless of performance.
Over the past three years, WiseTech Global Limited has seen its earnings per share (EPS) grow by 8.5% per year. In the last year, its revenue is up 29%.
It's great to see that revenue growth is strong. And in that context, the modest EPS improvement certainly isn't shabby. We'd stop short of saying the business performance is amazing, but there are enough positives to justify further research, or even adding the stock to your watch-list. Looking ahead, you might want to check 
.
Most shareholders would probably be pleased with WiseTech Global Limited for providing a total return of 121% over three years. As a result, some may believe the CEO should be paid more than is normal for companies of similar size.
The company's overall performance, while not bad, could be better. Assuming the business continues to grow at a good clip, few shareholders would raise any objections to the CEO's remuneration. Instead, investors might be more interested in discussions that would help manage their longer-term growth expectations such as company business strategies and future growth potential.
CEO compensation is one thing, but it is also interesting to

Are Strong Financial Prospects The Force That Is Driving The Momentum In WiseTech Global Limited's ASX:WTC) Stock?

Most readers would already be aware that WiseTech Global's (ASX:WTC) stock increased significantly by 10% over the past month. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study WiseTech Global's ROE in this article.
Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.
The 
 is:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for WiseTech Global is:
11% = AU$212m ÷ AU$1.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).
The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every A$1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of A$0.11.
Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or "retains", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
At first glance, WiseTech Global seems to have a decent ROE. Even when compared to the industry average of 9.4% the company's ROE looks quite decent. Consequently, this likely laid the ground for the impressive net income growth of 29% seen over the past five years by WiseTech Global. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.
We then compared WiseTech Global's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 22% in the same 5-year period.
The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if WiseTech Global is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.
WiseTech Global has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 19%, meaning that it has the remaining 81% left over to reinvest into its business. So it looks like WiseTech Global is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth.
Moreover, WiseTech Global is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of seven years of paying a dividend. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 20%. Regardless, the future ROE for WiseTech Global is predicted to rise to 18% despite there being not much change expected in its payout ratio.
On the whole, we feel that WiseTech Global's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. We also studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that the company's earnings growth is expected be similar to its current growth rate.

With EPS Growth And More, WiseTech Global (ASX:WTC) Makes An Interesting Case

For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.
Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like 
 (ASX:WTC). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.
If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Over the last three years, WiseTech Global has grown EPS by 8.5% per year. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.
One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. WiseTech Global maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 29% to AU$817m. That's a real positive.
You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image.
Of course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for WiseTech Global.
Owing to the size of WiseTech Global, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at AU$2.2b. Holders should find this level of insider commitment quite encouraging, since it would ensure that the leaders of the company would also experience their success, or failure, with the stock.
While it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. Well, based on the CEO pay, you'd argue that they are indeed. For companies with market capitalisations over AU$12b, like WiseTech Global, the median CEO pay is around AU$6.2m.
The CEO of WiseTech Global only received AU$1.1m in total compensation for the year ending June 2023. First impressions seem to indicate a compensation policy that is favourable to shareholders. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.
One important encouraging feature of WiseTech Global is that it is growing profits. Earnings growth might be the main attraction for WiseTech Global, but the fun does 
 stop there. Boasting both modest CEO pay and considerable insider ownership, you'd argue this one is worthy of the watchlist, at least.

Private companies invested in WiseTech Global Limited (ASX:WTC) copped the brunt of last week's AU$711m market cap decline

Every investor in WiseTech Global Limited (
) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 40% to be precise, is private companies. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
And following last week's 3.3% decline in share price, private companies suffered the most losses.
Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about WiseTech Global.
Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.
As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in WiseTech Global. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of WiseTech Global, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.
WiseTech Global is not owned by hedge funds. Realwise Holdings Pty Ltd is currently the largest shareholder, with 40% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 5.2% and 5.0% of the stock.
After doing some more digging, we found that the top 3 shareholders collectively control more than half of the company's shares, implying that they have considerable power to influence the company's decisions.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
We can report that insiders do own shares in WiseTech Global Limited. It is a very large company, and board members collectively own AU$2.0b worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking 
The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 30% stake in WiseTech Global. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.
We can see that Private Companies own 40%, of the shares on issue. It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company.
It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand WiseTech Global better, we need to consider many other factors.

Is There Now An Opportunity In WiseTech Global Limited (ASX:WTC)?

Let's talk about the popular WiseTech Global Limited (
). The company's shares saw a significant share price rise of 43% in the past couple of months on the ASX. The company's trading levels have reached its high for the past year, following the recent bounce in the share price. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at WiseTech Global’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.
According to our valuation model, WiseTech Global seems to be fairly priced at around 6.6% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy WiseTech Global today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is A$95.01, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. In addition to this, WiseTech Global has a low beta, which suggests its share price is less volatile than the wider market.
Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. WiseTech Global's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.
 WTC’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?
 If you’ve been keeping an eye on WTC, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

WiseTech Global Limited's (ASX:WTC) top owners are private companies with 41% stake, while 29% is held by individual investors

Every investor in WiseTech Global Limited (
) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 41% stake, private companies possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
Individual investors, on the other hand, account for 29% of the company's stockholders.
Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of WiseTech Global, beginning with the chart below.
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in WiseTech Global. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see WiseTech Global's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in WiseTech Global. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Realwise Holdings Pty Ltd with 40% of shares outstanding. Charles Gibbon is the second largest shareholder owning 5.2% of common stock, and Baillie Gifford & Co. holds about 5.0% of the company stock.
After doing some more digging, we found that the top 3 shareholders collectively control more than half of the company's shares, implying that they have considerable power to influence the company's decisions.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.
The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.
We can report that insiders do own shares in WiseTech Global Limited. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth AU$3.0b. It is good to see this level of investment. You can 
With a 29% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over WiseTech Global. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.
We can see that Private Companies own 41%, of the shares on issue. It might be worth looking deeper into this. If related parties, such as insiders, have an interest in one of these private companies, that should be disclosed in the annual report. Private companies may also have a strategic interest in the company.
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

WiseTech Global's (ASX:WTC) five-year earnings growth trails the massive shareholder returns

We think all investors should try to buy and hold high quality multi-year winners. While the best companies are hard to find, but they can generate massive returns over long periods. Don't believe it? Then look at the 
 (
) share price. It's 320% higher than it was five years ago. This just goes to show the value creation that some businesses can achieve. It's also good to see the share price up 33% over the last quarter. This could be related to the recent financial results, released recently - you can catch up on the most recent data by reading 
.
On the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns.
In his essay 
 Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.
During five years of share price growth, WiseTech Global achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 33% per year. That makes the EPS growth particularly close to the yearly share price growth of 33%. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.
The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).
It's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. This 
 interactive report on WiseTech Global's 
 is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.
As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, WiseTech Global's TSR for the last 5 years was 324%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!
We're pleased to report that WiseTech Global shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 55% over one year. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 34% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. Most investors take the time to check the data on insider transactions. You can

Returns At WiseTech Global (ASX:WTC) Appear To Be Weighed Down

If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. That's why when we briefly looked at 
 (
) ROCE trend, we were pretty happy with what we saw.
Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for WiseTech Global, this is the formula:
0.14 = AU$346m ÷ (AU$2.8b - AU$341m) 
.
Therefore, 
 In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Software industry average of 13%.
In the above chart we have measured WiseTech Global's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our 
 
.
While the returns on capital are good, they haven't moved much. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 14% and the business has deployed 288% more capital into its operations. Since 14% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.
In the end, WiseTech Global has proven its ability to adequately reinvest capital at good rates of return. And the stock has done incredibly well with a 313% return over the last five years, so long term investors are no doubt ecstatic with that result. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we still believe the stock deserves further research.
While WiseTech Global doesn't shine too bright in this respect, it's still worth seeing if the company is trading at attractive prices. You can find that out with our 
 on our platform.

Is WiseTech Global Limited's (ASX:WTC) Stock's Recent Performance Being Led By Its Attractive Financial Prospects?

WiseTech Global (ASX:WTC) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 5.8% over the last month. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Specifically, we decided to study 
 ROE in this article.
Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for WiseTech Global is:
11% = AU$221m ÷ AU$2.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).
The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every A$1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of A$0.11.
We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or "retains", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
At first glance, WiseTech Global seems to have a decent ROE. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 10%. This certainly adds some context to WiseTech Global's exceptional 25% net income growth seen over the past five years. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.
As a next step, we compared WiseTech Global's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 24% in the same period.
Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is WiseTech Global fairly valued compared to other companies? These 
 might help you decide.
WiseTech Global's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 20%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 80% of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business as evidenced by the growth seen by the company.
Besides, WiseTech Global has been paying dividends over a period of seven years. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 22%. Regardless, the future ROE for WiseTech Global is predicted to rise to 20% despite there being not much change expected in its payout ratio.
On the whole, we feel that WiseTech Global's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. On studying current analyst estimates, we found that analysts expect the company to continue its recent growth streak.

Does This Valuation Of WiseTech Global Limited (ASX:WTC) Imply Investors Are Overpaying?

Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of WiseTech Global Limited (
) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.
Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the 
 may be something of interest to you.
We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:
 = AU$6.0b
We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.3%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.8%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$1.6b× (1 + 2.3%) ÷ (6.8%– 2.3%) = AU$36b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$36b÷ ( 1 + 6.8%)
= AU$19b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is AU$25b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of AU$100, the company appears reasonably expensive at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.
The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at WiseTech Global as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.985. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value lower than the current share price? For WiseTech Global, we've put together three important items you should further examine:

Building the operating system for global and landside logistics

On a recent episode of Fuller Speed Ahead, Craig Fuller, founder and CEO at FreightWaves, was joined by Mark Picarello, managing director at SecurSpace and CargoWise Landside, to talk about the state of the market and highlight recent enhancements in their CargoWise platform.
Fuller notes that WiseTech Global, the parent company, has made a number of acquisitions across the supply chain space. Picarello notes that one of the big, positive impacts from the recent acquisitions has been the gains in automation within the CargoWise platform.
“I would say providing our customers with electronic ways of dealing with transportation, where things have been paper and slow, [and] it’s now really all-electronic, that’s what all of the areas, all of the products within that CargoWise platform, including CargoWise Landside, are about. Automating that interaction between shippers, carriers, and the rest of the supply chain.”
Picarello highlighted the COVID freight boom and bust, but believes that even if you took out the pandemic, there would still be a sustained increase in volumes, just not at the extreme level of the past four years.
For CargoWise Landside, its particular interest is in intermodal drayage. “A lot of what we do is around drayage and getting things out of the port efficiently,” he says.
“The challenge when things come into the port, is that you only have a certain number of days for them to sit there before you start getting charges, and they might not have an alternate destination yet.” The added challenge then becomes knowing where the assets are, how to move them between these different areas, and the types of transportation needed to make it happen, Picarello explains
“Visibility is an overused term, but really understanding ‘where is that piece of equipment?’, ‘that container,’ ‘my merchandise,’ so that I know what I need to do to get it to the ultimate destination.”
For drayage operators, a top-of-mind concern continues to be port congestion on the truck side and less the container side. “You see the lines of trucks with these chassis either trying to get in or out. That’s time, that’s money, and while they’re sitting there in traffic, that costs them.”
It’s one thing to move the containers in and out, but for chassis and containers, Picarello notes that property space and places to park and store them remain a premium. Technology is an important piece but cannot be the only solution by itself. Regarding the application of technology, Picrarello says, “If you know where something is and when it’s coming in, you can plan ahead for those movements, schedule them in a way that [includes] maybe a certain time of day when there’s a little less congestion.”
Fuller notes that CargoWise’s legacy was in freight forwarding, but as it moved into surface or land logistics, it created the CargoWise Landside solution suite. Picarello says, “WiseTech has acquired a number of companies along their journey, and the whole product strategy is really to be the logistics operating system for the world.”
“So, if you think of it that way, all areas of transportation and all things our freight forwarders, 3PLs and even shippers need to deal with need to be covered by the platform.” Picarello goes on to highlight the recent acquisitions giving it broader TMS functionality, which includes landside logistics.
Storage and secure spaces for parking is another functionality that Picarello highlighted, as not all shipments need to move immediately. “There are times when you need to find some storage or parking, and that’s the part of the CargoWise Landside vision, to really provide that end-to-end visibility control whether it’s a freight forwarder, 3PL or shipper.”
The ultimate prize according to Picarello is end-to-end and door-to-door, from the origin in manufacturing all the way to consumers, from retail distribution centers or consumption points. “And that’s why we call it the logistics operating system,” Pircarello says.
“We have a very extensive partner program, and we try to not get in our partners’ way. We have service partners that can do all the configuration to help customers get the process right through their platform. We’ve also got business partners who bring organizations to us that need it. And all of those different partners work with us to really drive more use of the platform and get customers to use it efficiently because sometimes—we’ve all done it—you buy software and you want to apply it to what you do rather than thinking about how can I [make it] efficiently work – maybe what I’m doing right now isn’t the most efficient way so why would I want to make the system work my [current] way?”
Pircarello adds the ultimate goal is to help those same business partners help customers eliminate a lot of those manual processes. “The capabilities within CargoWise allow our customers to do that, whether it’s the TMS as part of CargoWise Landside, or whether it’s the broader capabilities of the platform. It’s really about automating that workflow in a way that allows people to work most efficiently.”
This also includes connecting and integrating with airlines, TMS systems from other carriers, and digitization efforts like tracking, pricing, or processing bills of lading.
When looking ahead to the next 12 months, Picarello believes that despite the challenges lingering from the pandemic boom and bust, the drayage space looks promising. “I think there are multiple inputs, but it’s clear that volume went up a little bit [and] it’s settling down, which is a normal trend when you look at the industry. That settling at this point in the year really means that we have a good opportunity through the rest of the year and into the holiday season, where we’ll see increases in imports and containers.”
The exact extent of these volume gains remains a challenge. Regardless of the volumes and demand, Picarello believes that, at the end of the day, it’s about creating value. “I would say the WiseTech philosophy is to really deliver value, and I know it’s easy to say that, but we will not deliver something until we believe it’s right for the customer, even if it means it takes longer than what we would want it to be,” he says.
“It’s why [the] top 25 freight forwarders use our platform. If we get it right the first time, and they continue to expand their use of the platform, [it’s] because we’re adding that value, and that’s really our goal.”

At AU$93.46, Is It Time To Put WiseTech Global Limited (ASX:WTC) On Your Watch List?

Today we're going to take a look at the well-established WiseTech Global Limited (
). The company's stock saw significant share price movement during recent months on the ASX, rising to highs of AU$102 and falling to the lows of AU$88.81. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether WiseTech Global's current trading price of AU$93.46 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at WiseTech Global’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.
The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It’s trading around 15.90% above our intrinsic value, which means if you buy WiseTech Global today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth A$80.64, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. In addition to this, WiseTech Global has a low beta, which suggests its share price is less volatile than the wider market.
Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for WiseTech Global. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.
 WTC’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?
 If you’ve been keeping tabs on WTC, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

The total return for WiseTech Global (ASX:WTC) investors has risen faster than earnings growth over the last five years

 (
) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 18% in the last quarter. But that doesn't change the fact that shareholders have received really good returns over the last five years. We think most investors would be happy with the 237% return, over that period. Generally speaking the long term returns will give you a better idea of business quality than short periods can. Only time will tell if there is still too much optimism currently reflected in the share price.
Since the long term performance has been good but there's been a recent pullback of 6.2%, let's check if the fundamentals match the share price.
There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).
Over half a decade, WiseTech Global managed to grow its earnings per share at 36% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 27% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock. Having said that, the market is still optimistic, given the P/E ratio of 97.53.
The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).
We like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of WiseTech Global's 
.
It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of WiseTech Global, it has a TSR of 240% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!
It's nice to see that WiseTech Global shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 14% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 28% a year, is even better. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. If you want to research this stock further, the data on insider buying is an obvious place to start. You can

Private companies invested in WiseTech Global Limited (ASX:WTC) copped the brunt of last week's AU$711m market cap decline

Every investor in WiseTech Global Limited (
) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 40% to be precise, is private companies. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
And following last week's 3.3% decline in share price, private companies suffered the most losses.
Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about WiseTech Global.
Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.
As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in WiseTech Global. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of WiseTech Global, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.
WiseTech Global is not owned by hedge funds. Realwise Holdings Pty Ltd is currently the largest shareholder, with 40% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 5.2% and 5.0% of the stock.
After doing some more digging, we found that the top 3 shareholders collectively control more than half of the company's shares, implying that they have considerable power to influence the company's decisions.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
We can report that insiders do own shares in WiseTech Global Limited. It is a very large company, and board members collectively own AU$2.0b worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking 
The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 30% stake in WiseTech Global. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.
We can see that Private Companies own 40%, of the shares on issue. It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company.
It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand WiseTech Global better, we need to consider many other factors.

WiseTech Global (ASX:WTC) Has Some Way To Go To Become A Multi-Bagger

If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. Firstly, we'll want to see a proven 
 on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding 
 of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So, when we ran our eye over 
 (
) trend of ROCE, we liked what we saw.
For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for WiseTech Global:
0.16 = AU$328m ÷ (AU$2.7b - AU$581m) 
.
So, 
 In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Software industry average of 11% it's much better.
In the above chart we have measured WiseTech Global's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering WiseTech Global 
 for 
While the current returns on capital are decent, they haven't changed much. The company has consistently earned 16% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 354% in that time. Since 16% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.
To sum it up, WiseTech Global has simply been reinvesting capital steadily, at those decent rates of return. And the stock has done incredibly well with a 337% return over the last five years, so long term investors are no doubt ecstatic with that result. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.
While WiseTech Global doesn't shine too bright in this respect, it's still worth seeing if the company is trading at attractive prices. You can find that out with our

WiseTech Global's (ASX:WTC) five-year earnings growth trails the massive shareholder returns

We think all investors should try to buy and hold high quality multi-year winners. While the best companies are hard to find, but they can generate massive returns over long periods. Don't believe it? Then look at the 
 (
) share price. It's 320% higher than it was five years ago. This just goes to show the value creation that some businesses can achieve. It's also good to see the share price up 33% over the last quarter. This could be related to the recent financial results, released recently - you can catch up on the most recent data by reading 
.
On the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns.
In his essay 
 Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.
During five years of share price growth, WiseTech Global achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 33% per year. That makes the EPS growth particularly close to the yearly share price growth of 33%. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.
The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).
It's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. This 
 interactive report on WiseTech Global's 
 is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.
As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, WiseTech Global's TSR for the last 5 years was 324%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!
We're pleased to report that WiseTech Global shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 55% over one year. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 34% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. Most investors take the time to check the data on insider transactions. You can

With EPS Growth And More, WiseTech Global (ASX:WTC) Makes An Interesting Case

For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.
Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like 
 (ASX:WTC). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.
If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Over the last three years, WiseTech Global has grown EPS by 8.5% per year. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.
One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. WiseTech Global maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 29% to AU$817m. That's a real positive.
You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image.
Of course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for WiseTech Global.
Owing to the size of WiseTech Global, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at AU$2.2b. Holders should find this level of insider commitment quite encouraging, since it would ensure that the leaders of the company would also experience their success, or failure, with the stock.
While it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. Well, based on the CEO pay, you'd argue that they are indeed. For companies with market capitalisations over AU$12b, like WiseTech Global, the median CEO pay is around AU$6.2m.
The CEO of WiseTech Global only received AU$1.1m in total compensation for the year ending June 2023. First impressions seem to indicate a compensation policy that is favourable to shareholders. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.
One important encouraging feature of WiseTech Global is that it is growing profits. Earnings growth might be the main attraction for WiseTech Global, but the fun does 
 stop there. Boasting both modest CEO pay and considerable insider ownership, you'd argue this one is worthy of the watchlist, at least. Another important measure of business quality not discussed here, is return on equity (ROE). Click on this link to see how WiseTech Global shapes up to industry peers, when it comes to ROE.

Are Strong Financial Prospects The Force That Is Driving The Momentum In WiseTech Global Limited's ASX:WTC) Stock?

Most readers would already be aware that WiseTech Global's (ASX:WTC) stock increased significantly by 10% over the past month. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study WiseTech Global's ROE in this article.
Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.
The 
 is:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for WiseTech Global is:
11% = AU$212m ÷ AU$1.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).
The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every A$1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of A$0.11.
Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or "retains", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
At first glance, WiseTech Global seems to have a decent ROE. Even when compared to the industry average of 9.4% the company's ROE looks quite decent. Consequently, this likely laid the ground for the impressive net income growth of 29% seen over the past five years by WiseTech Global. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.
We then compared WiseTech Global's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 22% in the same 5-year period.
The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if WiseTech Global is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.
WiseTech Global has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 19%, meaning that it has the remaining 81% left over to reinvest into its business. So it looks like WiseTech Global is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth.
Moreover, WiseTech Global is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of seven years of paying a dividend. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 20%. Regardless, the future ROE for WiseTech Global is predicted to rise to 18% despite there being not much change expected in its payout ratio.

WiseTech Global Limited's (ASX:WTC) top owners are private companies with 41% stake, while 29% is held by individual investors

Every investor in WiseTech Global Limited (
) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 41% stake, private companies possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
Individual investors, on the other hand, account for 29% of the company's stockholders.
Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of WiseTech Global, beginning with the chart below.
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in WiseTech Global. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see WiseTech Global's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in WiseTech Global. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Realwise Holdings Pty Ltd with 40% of shares outstanding. Charles Gibbon is the second largest shareholder owning 5.2% of common stock, and Baillie Gifford & Co. holds about 5.0% of the company stock.
After doing some more digging, we found that the top 3 shareholders collectively control more than half of the company's shares, implying that they have considerable power to influence the company's decisions.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.
The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.
We can report that insiders do own shares in WiseTech Global Limited. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth AU$3.0b. It is good to see this level of investment. You can 
With a 29% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over WiseTech Global. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.
We can see that Private Companies own 41%, of the shares on issue. It might be worth looking deeper into this. If related parties, such as insiders, have an interest in one of these private companies, that should be disclosed in the annual report. Private companies may also have a strategic interest in the company.
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

Returns At WiseTech Global (ASX:WTC) Appear To Be Weighed Down

If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. That's why when we briefly looked at 
 (
) ROCE trend, we were pretty happy with what we saw.
Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for WiseTech Global, this is the formula:
0.14 = AU$346m ÷ (AU$2.8b - AU$341m) 
.
Therefore, 
 In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Software industry average of 13%.
In the above chart we have measured WiseTech Global's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our 
 
.
While the returns on capital are good, they haven't moved much. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 14% and the business has deployed 288% more capital into its operations. Since 14% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.
In the end, WiseTech Global has proven its ability to adequately reinvest capital at good rates of return. And the stock has done incredibly well with a 313% return over the last five years, so long term investors are no doubt ecstatic with that result. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we still believe the stock deserves further research.
While WiseTech Global doesn't shine too bright in this respect, it's still worth seeing if the company is trading at attractive prices. You can find that out with our 
 on our platform.
While WiseTech Global may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity. Check out this

Is WiseTech Global Limited's (ASX:WTC) Stock's Recent Performance Being Led By Its Attractive Financial Prospects?

WiseTech Global (ASX:WTC) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 5.8% over the last month. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Specifically, we decided to study 
 ROE in this article.
Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for WiseTech Global is:
11% = AU$221m ÷ AU$2.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).
The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every A$1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of A$0.11.
We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or "retains", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
At first glance, WiseTech Global seems to have a decent ROE. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 10%. This certainly adds some context to WiseTech Global's exceptional 25% net income growth seen over the past five years. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.
As a next step, we compared WiseTech Global's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 24% in the same period.
Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is WiseTech Global fairly valued compared to other companies? These 
 might help you decide.
WiseTech Global's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 20%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 80% of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business as evidenced by the growth seen by the company.
Besides, WiseTech Global has been paying dividends over a period of seven years. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 22%. Regardless, the future ROE for WiseTech Global is predicted to rise to 20% despite there being not much change expected in its payout ratio.
On the whole, we feel that WiseTech Global's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. On studying current analyst estimates, we found that analysts expect the company to continue its recent growth streak.

It May Be Possible That WiseTech Global Limited's (ASX:WTC) CEO Compensation Could Get Bumped Up

Shareholders will be pleased by the robust performance of 
 (
) recently and this will be kept in mind in the upcoming AGM on 23rd of November. The focus will probably be on the future strategic initiatives that the board and management will put in place to improve the business rather than executive remuneration when they cast their votes on company resolutions. In our analysis below, we discuss why we think the CEO compensation looks acceptable and the case for a raise.
At the time of writing, our data shows that WiseTech Global Limited has a market capitalization of AU$22b, and reported total annual CEO compensation of AU$1.1m for the year to June 2023. This means that the compensation hasn't changed much from last year. Notably, the salary which is AU$974.7k, represents most of the total compensation being paid.
For comparison, other companies in the 
 with market capitalizations above AU$12b, reported a median total CEO compensation of AU$17m. That is to say, Richard White is paid under the industry median.
Speaking on an industry level, nearly 59% of total compensation represents salary, while the remainder of 41% is other remuneration. WiseTech Global pays out 89% of remuneration in the form of a salary, significantly higher than the industry average. If salary is the major component in total compensation, it suggests that the CEO receives a higher fixed proportion of the total compensation, regardless of performance.
Over the past three years, WiseTech Global Limited has seen its earnings per share (EPS) grow by 8.5% per year. In the last year, its revenue is up 29%.
It's great to see that revenue growth is strong. And in that context, the modest EPS improvement certainly isn't shabby. We'd stop short of saying the business performance is amazing, but there are enough positives to justify further research, or even adding the stock to your watch-list. Looking ahead, you might want to check 
.
Most shareholders would probably be pleased with WiseTech Global Limited for providing a total return of 121% over three years. As a result, some may believe the CEO should be paid more than is normal for companies of similar size.
The company's overall performance, while not bad, could be better. Assuming the business continues to grow at a good clip, few shareholders would raise any objections to the CEO's remuneration. Instead, investors might be more interested in discussions that would help manage their longer-term growth expectations such as company business strategies and future growth potential.
CEO compensation is one thing, but it is also interesting to

Does This Valuation Of WiseTech Global Limited (ASX:WTC) Imply Investors Are Overpaying?

Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of WiseTech Global Limited (
) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.
Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the 
 may be something of interest to you.
We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:
 = AU$6.0b
We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.3%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.8%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$1.6b× (1 + 2.3%) ÷ (6.8%– 2.3%) = AU$36b
= TV / (1 + r)
= AU$36b÷ ( 1 + 6.8%)
= AU$19b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is AU$25b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of AU$100, the company appears reasonably expensive at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.
The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at WiseTech Global as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.985. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value lower than the current share price? For WiseTech Global, we've put together three important items you should further examine:

Building the operating system for global and landside logistics

On a recent episode of Fuller Speed Ahead, Craig Fuller, founder and CEO at FreightWaves, was joined by Mark Picarello, managing director at SecurSpace and CargoWise Landside, to talk about the state of the market and highlight recent enhancements in their CargoWise platform.
Fuller notes that WiseTech Global, the parent company, has made a number of acquisitions across the supply chain space. Picarello notes that one of the big, positive impacts from the recent acquisitions has been the gains in automation within the CargoWise platform.
“I would say providing our customers with electronic ways of dealing with transportation, where things have been paper and slow, [and] it’s now really all-electronic, that’s what all of the areas, all of the products within that CargoWise platform, including CargoWise Landside, are about. Automating that interaction between shippers, carriers, and the rest of the supply chain.”
Picarello highlighted the COVID freight boom and bust, but believes that even if you took out the pandemic, there would still be a sustained increase in volumes, just not at the extreme level of the past four years.
For CargoWise Landside, its particular interest is in intermodal drayage. “A lot of what we do is around drayage and getting things out of the port efficiently,” he says.
“The challenge when things come into the port, is that you only have a certain number of days for them to sit there before you start getting charges, and they might not have an alternate destination yet.” The added challenge then becomes knowing where the assets are, how to move them between these different areas, and the types of transportation needed to make it happen, Picarello explains
“Visibility is an overused term, but really understanding ‘where is that piece of equipment?’, ‘that container,’ ‘my merchandise,’ so that I know what I need to do to get it to the ultimate destination.”
For drayage operators, a top-of-mind concern continues to be port congestion on the truck side and less the container side. “You see the lines of trucks with these chassis either trying to get in or out. That’s time, that’s money, and while they’re sitting there in traffic, that costs them.”
It’s one thing to move the containers in and out, but for chassis and containers, Picarello notes that property space and places to park and store them remain a premium. Technology is an important piece but cannot be the only solution by itself. Regarding the application of technology, Picrarello says, “If you know where something is and when it’s coming in, you can plan ahead for those movements, schedule them in a way that [includes] maybe a certain time of day when there’s a little less congestion.”
Fuller notes that CargoWise’s legacy was in freight forwarding, but as it moved into surface or land logistics, it created the CargoWise Landside solution suite. Picarello says, “WiseTech has acquired a number of companies along their journey, and the whole product strategy is really to be the logistics operating system for the world.”
“So, if you think of it that way, all areas of transportation and all things our freight forwarders, 3PLs and even shippers need to deal with need to be covered by the platform.” Picarello goes on to highlight the recent acquisitions giving it broader TMS functionality, which includes landside logistics.
Storage and secure spaces for parking is another functionality that Picarello highlighted, as not all shipments need to move immediately. “There are times when you need to find some storage or parking, and that’s the part of the CargoWise Landside vision, to really provide that end-to-end visibility control whether it’s a freight forwarder, 3PL or shipper.”
The ultimate prize according to Picarello is end-to-end and door-to-door, from the origin in manufacturing all the way to consumers, from retail distribution centers or consumption points. “And that’s why we call it the logistics operating system,” Pircarello says.
“We have a very extensive partner program, and we try to not get in our partners’ way. We have service partners that can do all the configuration to help customers get the process right through their platform. We’ve also got business partners who bring organizations to us that need it. And all of those different partners work with us to really drive more use of the platform and get customers to use it efficiently because sometimes—we’ve all done it—you buy software and you want to apply it to what you do rather than thinking about how can I [make it] efficiently work – maybe what I’m doing right now isn’t the most efficient way so why would I want to make the system work my [current] way?”
Pircarello adds the ultimate goal is to help those same business partners help customers eliminate a lot of those manual processes. “The capabilities within CargoWise allow our customers to do that, whether it’s the TMS as part of CargoWise Landside, or whether it’s the broader capabilities of the platform. It’s really about automating that workflow in a way that allows people to work most efficiently.”
This also includes connecting and integrating with airlines, TMS systems from other carriers, and digitization efforts like tracking, pricing, or processing bills of lading.
When looking ahead to the next 12 months, Picarello believes that despite the challenges lingering from the pandemic boom and bust, the drayage space looks promising. “I think there are multiple inputs, but it’s clear that volume went up a little bit [and] it’s settling down, which is a normal trend when you look at the industry. That settling at this point in the year really means that we have a good opportunity through the rest of the year and into the holiday season, where we’ll see increases in imports and containers.”
The exact extent of these volume gains remains a challenge. Regardless of the volumes and demand, Picarello believes that, at the end of the day, it’s about creating value. “I would say the WiseTech philosophy is to really deliver value, and I know it’s easy to say that, but we will not deliver something until we believe it’s right for the customer, even if it means it takes longer than what we would want it to be,” he says.
“It’s why [the] top 25 freight forwarders use our platform. If we get it right the first time, and they continue to expand their use of the platform, [it’s] because we’re adding that value, and that’s really our goal.”

). The company's stock saw significant share price movement during recent months on the ASX, rising to highs of AU$102 and falling to the lows of AU$88.81. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether WiseTech Global's current trading price of AU$93.46 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at WiseTech Global’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.
The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It’s trading around 15.90% above our intrinsic value, which means if you buy WiseTech Global today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth A$80.64, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. In addition to this, WiseTech Global has a low beta, which suggests its share price is less volatile than the wider market.
Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for WiseTech Global. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.
 WTC’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?
 If you’ve been keeping tabs on WTC, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

Let's talk about the popular WiseTech Global Limited (
). The company's shares saw a significant share price rise of 43% in the past couple of months on the ASX. The company's trading levels have reached its high for the past year, following the recent bounce in the share price. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at WiseTech Global’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.
According to our valuation model, WiseTech Global seems to be fairly priced at around 6.6% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy WiseTech Global today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is A$95.01, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. In addition to this, WiseTech Global has a low beta, which suggests its share price is less volatile than the wider market.
Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. WiseTech Global's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.
 WTC’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?
 If you’ve been keeping an eye on WTC, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.
