Is Xero Limited (ASX:XRO) Expensive For A Reason? A Look At Its Intrinsic Value

How far off is Xero Limited (
) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.
Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the 
.
We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:
 = NZ$4.1b
We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.1%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = NZ$1.1b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.1%– 2.0%) = NZ$22b
= TV / (1 + r)
= NZ$22b÷ ( 1 + 7.1%)
= NZ$11b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is NZ$15b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of AU$124, the company appears potentially overvalued at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.
Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Xero as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.016. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price exceeding the intrinsic value? For Xero, there are three important factors you should assess:

Is Xero Limited (ASX:XRO) Potentially Undervalued?

Let's talk about the popular Xero Limited (
). The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the ASX over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine Xero’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity.
Xero appears to be overvalued by 24% at the moment, based on my discounted cash flow valuation. The stock is currently priced at AU$114 on the market compared to my intrinsic value of A$92.51. Not the best news for investors looking to buy! In addition to this, it seems like Xero’s share price is quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to fall back down to an attractive buying range, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.
Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. In Xero's case, its revenues over the next few years are expected to grow by 66%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. If expense does not increase by the same rate, or higher, this top line growth should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.
 XRO’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe XRO should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.
 If you’ve been keeping an eye on XRO for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for XRO, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

Those who invested in Xero (ASX:XRO) five years ago are up 140%

The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. One great example is 
 (
) which saw its share price drive 140% higher over five years. On the other hand, we note it's down 9.9% in about a month. We note that the broader market is down 4.6% in the last month, and this may have impacted Xero's share price.
With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.
To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.
Xero has made a profit in the past. However, it made a loss in the last twelve months, suggesting profit may be an unreliable metric at this stage. So it might be better to look at other metrics to try to understand the share price.
On the other hand, Xero's revenue is growing nicely, at a compound rate of 23% over the last five years. In that case, the company may be sacrificing current earnings per share to drive growth.
The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).
We're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. If you are thinking of buying or selling Xero stock, you should check out this 
 
.
We're pleased to report that Xero shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 47% over one year. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 19%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. Shareholders might want to examine 
 of past earnings, revenue and cash flow.

Retail investors who have a significant stake must be disappointed along with institutions after Xero Limited's (ASX:XRO) market cap dropped by AU$1.3b

A look at the shareholders of Xero Limited (
) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are retail investors with 55% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).
While institutions who own 36% came under pressure after market cap dropped to AU$17b last week,retail investors took the most losses.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Xero.
Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.
Xero already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Xero, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.
We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Xero. Rodney Drury is currently the largest shareholder, with 6.5% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 6.0% and 5.1%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.
A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.
Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.
We can report that insiders do own shares in Xero Limited. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth AU$1.5b. It is good to see this level of investment. You can 
The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a substantial 55% stake in Xero, suggesting it is a fairly popular stock. With this amount of ownership, retail investors can collectively play a role in decisions that affect shareholder returns, such as dividend policies and the appointment of directors. They can also exercise the power to vote on acquisitions or mergers that may not improve profitability.
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

At AU$113, Is Xero Limited (ASX:XRO) Worth Looking At Closely?

Xero Limited (
) saw a decent share price growth of 14% on the ASX over the last few months. Shareholders may appreciate the recent price jump, but the company still has a way to go before reaching its yearly highs again. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine Xero’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity.
According to our valuation model, the stock is currently overvalued by about 23%, trading at AU$113 compared to our intrinsic value of A$91.84. This means that the buying opportunity has probably disappeared for now. In addition to this, it seems like Xero’s share price is quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to fall back down to an attractive buying range, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.
Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. In Xero's case, its revenues over the next few years are expected to grow by 60%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. If expense does not increase by the same rate, or higher, this top line growth should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.
 XRO’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above its fair value. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe XRO should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.

Xero (ASX:XRO) Is Looking To Continue Growing Its Returns On Capital

If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in 
 (
) returns on capital, so let's have a look.
For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Xero, this is the formula:
0.058 = NZ$141m ÷ (NZ$2.6b - NZ$229m) 
.
Thus, 
 In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Software industry average of 11%.
In the above chart we have measured Xero's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Xero 
 for 
The fact that Xero is now generating some pre-tax profits from its prior investments is very encouraging. The company was generating losses five years ago, but now it's earning 5.8% which is a sight for sore eyes. And unsurprisingly, like most companies trying to break into the black, Xero is utilizing 189% more capital than it was five years ago. We like this trend, because it tells us the company has profitable reinvestment opportunities available to it, and if it continues going forward that can lead to a multi-bagger performance.
Overall, Xero gets a big tick from us thanks in most part to the fact that it is now profitable and is reinvesting in its business. And a remarkable 159% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist.
On the other side of ROCE, we have to consider valuation. That's why we have a

Xero Partners with BILL to Deliver Industry-leading Bill Pay Capabilities for Small Businesses

--(
)--
 (ASX: XRO), the global small business platform, today announced a strategic partnership with 
 (NYSE: BILL), a leading financial operations platform for small and midsize businesses (SMBs), to extend accounts payable capabilities to Xero’s US customers.
Xero will embed a bill pay solution from BILL into the Xero platform. Once available, the solution will deeply integrate BILL’s robust payments options, allowing customers to more efficiently pay their bills, without leaving the Xero Platform. BILL is a trusted partner of leading U.S. financial institutions, accounting firms, and accounting software providers.
There are more than 
 in the US. Paying bills and getting paid on time are critical requirements for small businesses to effectively manage cash flow. However, this is still a very manual process for many small businesses. According to Xero’s 
, small businesses utilize multiple and disparate payment strategies to manage their cash flow.
Xero and BILL are partnering to make financial automation and cash flow management easier and more accessible for US Xero customers. Once the new embedded bill pay solution is available, small businesses will be able to avoid manual bank transfers, writing and mailing checks or entering credit card details to pay their bills. The solution will make it easier for small businesses and their advisors to reconcile transactions, regardless of their bank, and provide greater visibility and control over their cash flow. Every hour small businesses save through automation, is an hour they can invest in their business.
The bill pay solution will enable Xero customers to access BILL’s proprietary network of 5.8 million members – enabling small businesses to use the network to find their vendor and easily and efficiently start paying them straight away. More details about the bill pay solution will be made available later this calendar year.

This includes delivering payment solutions that help customers easily make and collect payments. Through our partnership with BILL, we can offer our customers more robust bill pay capabilities and broad payment choices, which further strengthens Xero’s US offering and reinforces our commitment to deepen customer support and engagement."
Irana Wasti, Chief Product Officer at BILL said: "We are excited to bring an embedded bill pay solution and related financial operations capabilities to Xero customers. From the start, BILL has worked to serve the needs of SMBs and make it simpler to manage and optimize their cash flow. Our agile platform enables us to incorporate capabilities into partner solutions to extend our ability to serve more SMBs, wherever they want to do business."

Xero Limited's (ASX:XRO) 6.7% loss last week hit both individual investors who own 60% as well as institutions

A look at the shareholders of Xero Limited (
) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that retail investors own the lion's share in the company with 60% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).
While institutions who own 31% came under pressure after market cap dropped to AU$19b last week,retail investors took the most losses.
Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Xero, beginning with the chart below.
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
Xero already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Xero, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.
We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Xero. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Rodney Drury with 6.5% of shares outstanding. The second and third largest shareholders are The Vanguard Group, Inc. and Hyperion Asset Management Limited, with an equal amount of shares to their name at 5.1%.
Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.
Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.
Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.
We can report that insiders do own shares in Xero Limited. It is a very large company, and board members collectively own AU$1.7b worth of shares (at current prices). we sometimes take an interest in 
The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a substantial 60% stake in Xero, suggesting it is a fairly popular stock. This size of ownership gives investors from the general public some collective power. They can and probably do influence decisions on executive compensation, dividend policies and proposed business acquisitions.
It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Xero better, we need to consider many other factors.

Xero (ASX:XRO) Is Experiencing Growth In Returns On Capital

To find a multi-bagger stock, what are the underlying trends we should look for in a business? Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing 
 on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding 
 of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in 
 (
) returns on capital, so let's have a look.
Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Xero is:
0.058 = NZ$141m ÷ (NZ$2.6b - NZ$229m) 
.
So, 
 Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Software industry average of 13%.
Above you can see how the current ROCE for Xero compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can 
 for 
The fact that Xero is now generating some pre-tax profits from its prior investments is very encouraging. The company was generating losses five years ago, but now it's earning 5.8% which is a sight for sore eyes. And unsurprisingly, like most companies trying to break into the black, Xero is utilizing 189% more capital than it was five years ago. We like this trend, because it tells us the company has profitable reinvestment opportunities available to it, and if it continues going forward that can lead to a multi-bagger performance.
Long story short, we're delighted to see that Xero's reinvestment activities have paid off and the company is now profitable. Since the stock has returned a staggering 136% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist.
While Xero looks impressive, no company is worth an infinite price. The

IT firm Xero launches $850 million convertible notes offering due 2031

(Reuters) - Software service company Xero on Tuesday announced it is raising $850 million by offering fixed coupon guaranteed senior unsecured convertible notes that are due to be repaid by 2031.
The move follows a recent surge in convertible bond offerings, including deals from Alibaba worth $4.5 billion and notable issues from Lenovo and JD.com amounting to $2 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively.
On Monday, Bloomberg News reported that Chinese developer Poly Developments and Holdings Group was considering a sale of convertible bonds worth $1.7 billion.
Xero said in its statement that it plans to list the notes on the Singapore stock exchange.
The net proceeds will be used to repurchase its existing notes and for potential acquisitions and investments, the IT firm added.
Xero said that its subsidiary, Xero Investments, was conducting a reverse bookbuilding process to attract investors for the company's $700 million buyback programme of existing convertible bonds.

Xero (ASX:XRO) shareholders have earned a 23% CAGR over the last five years

When you buy a stock there is always a possibility that it could drop 100%. But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. Long term 
 (
) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 178% in five years. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 23% gain in the last three months.
Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.
In his essay 
 Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.
We know that Xero has been profitable in the past. On the other hand, it reported a trailing twelve months loss, suggesting it isn't reliably profitable. So it might be better to look at other metrics to try to understand the share price.
On the other hand, Xero's revenue is growing nicely, at a compound rate of 22% over the last five years. It's quite possible that management are prioritizing revenue growth over EPS growth at the moment.
You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).
We're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. You can see what analysts are predicting for Xero in this 
 
.
It's nice to see that Xero shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 54% over the last year. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 23%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity.

Xero Limited (ASX:XRO) Stock's Been Sliding But Fundamentals Look Decent: Will The Market Correct The Share Price In The Future?

With its stock down 4.3% over the past week, it is easy to disregard Xero (ASX:XRO). However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. Specifically, we decided to study 
 ROE in this article.
Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Xero is:
13% = NZ$175m ÷ NZ$1.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).
The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every A$1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of A$0.13.
So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or "retain", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.
To start with, Xero's ROE looks acceptable. Especially when compared to the industry average of 10% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. However, for some reason, the higher returns aren't reflected in Xero's meagre five year net income growth average of 3.2%. This is interesting as the high returns should mean that the company has the ability to generate high growth but for some reason, it hasn't been able to do so. A few likely reasons why this could happen is that the company could have a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance.
Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Xero's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 24% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see.
Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is XRO worth today? The 
 helps visualize whether XRO is currently mispriced by the market.
Xero doesn't pay any regular dividends, which means that it is retaining all of its earnings. This doesn't explain the low earnings growth number that we discussed above. So there could be some other explanation in that regard. For instance, the company's business may be deteriorating.
On the whole, we do feel that Xero has some positive attributes. Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a high ROE and and a high reinvestment rate. We believe that there might be some outside factors that could be having a negative impact on the business. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

Calculating The Fair Value Of Xero Limited (ASX:XRO)

In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Xero Limited (
) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.
We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the 
 may be something of interest to you.
We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:
 = NZ$4.2b
After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.9%.
= FCF
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = NZ$1.1b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.2%) = NZ$23b
= TV / (1 + r)
= NZ$23b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)
= NZ$12b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is NZ$16b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of AU$118, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.
Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Xero as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.031. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to "what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For Xero, there are three additional aspects you should consider:

Is Now An Opportune Moment To Examine Xero Limited (ASX:XRO)?

Let's talk about the popular Xero Limited (
). The company's shares saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the ASX. The company's trading levels have approached the yearly peak, following the recent bounce in the share price. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine Xero’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity.
The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It’s trading around 1.9% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Xero today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is A$137.31, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. What's more, Xero’s share price may be more stable over time (relative to the market), as indicated by its low beta.
Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Xero. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.
 It seems like the market has already priced in XRO’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?
 If you’ve been keeping an eye on XRO, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

Estimating The Intrinsic Value Of Xero Limited (ASX:XRO)

How far off is Xero Limited ( 
 ) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.
Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the 
 .
We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:
 
 = NZ$6.4b
After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.3%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%.
 = FCF 
 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = NZ$1.5b× (1 + 2.3%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.3%) = NZ$32b
 = TV / (1 + r) 
 = NZ$32b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%) 
 = NZ$16b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is NZ$23b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of AU$131, the company appears about fair value at a 3.4% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.
We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Xero as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.014. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For Xero, we've put together three relevant factors you should further examine:
